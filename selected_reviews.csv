{"_id":{"$oid":"5e59f93d64166dd952b65561"},"Restaurant ID":"R0065","Review":"While I cant fault the service as our waitress was lovely the overall experience was very disappointing \n\nThe set menu at 54 euro per person had a number of supplement charges  one being a fiver supplement for a cheeseboard  as well as 2 euro supplements for tea/coffee  We were brought out water which we found out at the end was a 4 euro a bottle   its very frustrating when customers are offered water but its not specified that theyll be charged for it  Unless its specified they shouldnt be charged \n\nWe ordered the steak which was mediocre at best  Considering the price we were paying we expected a lot more  It was also cold when it was brought out  The sides at 6 euro extra were disappointing  \n\nWe were seated next to the host stand so found it awkward to have a proper conversation as we could see and hear everything the staff were doing as they were congregated there  \n\nOverall its not value for money  Id go as far as to say its actually a bit of a rip off  While the service was nice it doesnt make up for the fact that its a mediocre food  an ok experience and very overpriced  Would not recommend or return "}
