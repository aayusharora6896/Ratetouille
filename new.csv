R0001,A great place for Irish music great bar and full of great people  After the Irish band more modern music on a must go
R0001,Absolutely exceptional food and staff were very friendly and helpful  Lovely atmosphere will definitely be back
R0001,Cant remember pizza better than this anywhere in Dublin  Gorgeous  really authentic italian food  Great prices too 
R0001,Cocktails were very impressive and a perfect end to a seriously tasty meal  A very deserved 4 5 star rating 
R0001,Decent  clean  and fast  Food wasnt bad but maybe a bit under seasoned  Overall a good stop for a fast  cheap bite 
R0001,Excellent customer service  Our waitress was attentive  Delicious food  Ambience was perfect  Shows this place has great management 
R0001,Excellent Greek food  Great variety and plenty of options for a vegetarian  A welcome respite from all the heavy potato  and  bread laden Irish fare 
R0001,Fantastic meal and overall experience  Bar manager was outstanding 
R0001,"Food is fine  alcohol  wine  not great  Service is good and they will note allergies and provided gluten free bread for us 

Enjoyable and relaxing "
R0001,Great experience   super food and service 
R0001,Great food and the service was fantastic  Everyone was so friendly 
R0001,Had a lovely dinner last night  Service was efficient but not intrusive  Portion size just right  A pleasure  
R0001,"Hope  I""ll back there again  The best food in Dublin  Starters are very tasty and sreak was amazing  Desert was also very good  Good luck   "
R0001,"I have been here a few times with friends for drinks  As a bar to drink at  it is simply okay  Not the best but also not the worst  

 Recently my girlfriend received a gift voucher for a dinner here  Having never considered this a place for food we gave it a try  The dining experience didnt start out well when they mixed up our reservation thinking it was for the previous night  But since they had a table we were seated �They had a 8oz fillet listed for 26 50 on the nightly special menu and I decided to give it a try  I ordered it medium and I actually think that is what I received  but it was so bland and ugly it was hard to tell  The menu said it came with pepper sauce  which it didnt  When the waitress came by I asked for it  and she said it doesnt normally come with pepper sauce  okay  but it was on the menu so if you are a waiter or waitress you should be aware of what is on the menu at the restaurant you are working at  Unfortunately the pepper sauce didnt help it taste better  In fact it barely tasted like pepper sauce at all  instead it was like the cook took a bunch of the grease from the grill and mixed that with some peeper sauce flavoring into a little cup for me  �

To finish the night off  they messed up our desserts  which were the only good thing we ate BTW   messed up our bill  and throughout the meal my seat was continually bumped into and pushed by the staff because they have the tables so cramped together it is impossible to walk between them without needing to push them out of the way "
R0001,"I went there based on the online menu  It bore no resemblance to the menu on the night one person said it was the first night of the new menu  another said it was 3 years out of date  not a good reflection on � online app 
The staff tried to do their best  but we wont be going back "
R0001,Lovely food  staff and setting  This was a very pleasant surprise
R0001,Mediocre quality  came across as very tourist oriented rather than a neighborhood restaurant 
R0001,"Never again    

We went for lunch friday at 12 30 with the lads 
We ordered starter and Main course 
After 1 hour  we were not served 
1 hours 15 minutes    we left

We went back to work with an empty stomach"
R0001,"Not simple breakfast but beyond our expectations brunch   
Great coffee  lovely dishes  friendly staff and very cozy place "
R0001,Since I am a vegan  they specially got me a veg burger which was extremely kind of them  We finished the meal with ice cream cocktail which just sizzled our taste buds 
R0001,Slowest fast food on the planet 
R0001,Staff were very attentive  Had informed them of teenagers birthday and they made small sign for table to mark it  Lovely touch  Highly recommend for family celebration
R0001,Steaks were fab  Service was fab  Value fab  I typically tip 10 percent and for first time ever went 20 percent  This place deserved the extra  Nuf said 
R0001,The duck appetizer was amazing as well as the service and ambiance  I would definitely return  great find 
R0001,The food was good  I ordered online and was given a 25 min wait time  Service was prompt and polite  I have nothing to grumble about 
R0001,"The waitstaff excellent  The goat cheese salad  and  meat board   very good   My husband had the  lamb   I had the seafood capellini   The cook on the lamb was ok  but it lacked seasoning  The capellini was sticky  seafood cooked nicely  but not enough in proportion to pasta 

My cocktail  blood orange cosmopolitan tasted �watered � down   My husbands Old fashioned lacked in comparison to our previous versions of our favorites   

I wanted to really enjoy this experience  but the food didnt hold up to the previews that I read    Im sorry "
R0001,Very good meal  attentive wait staff  Couldnt have been happier 
R0001,"Very mixed Experience  

A group of friends from the US and some other countries were visiting Dublin for the weekend  and we booked a table for 10  We arrived at 8 pm and the restaurant seemed relatively quiet  Despite that  staff seemed thin on the ground and busy  we were over 30 minutes waiting with menus before our order was taken  and at that   it was only taken because we stopped a waiter to ask for them to take it  Drinks took an absolute age to arrive  we had to remind them several times  Another 90 minutes before the food actually arrived  in dribs and drabs  and some of the friends were really hungry and tired  and very jetlagged  when we arrived at 8  so it really wasnt ideal that we ended up eating so late as they had a flight to catch early the next day for the next part of their trip 

We were given a round of prosecco as an apology and some free desserts  which was a lovely gesture   and I understand these things happen sometimes  but to be honest we were embarrassed by the whole experience  given that we had recommended the place to our friends and I wouldnt be in a rush back any time soon "
R0001,Visit this place regularly  The food and service are always top quality  Great coffee  Nice atmosphere  Both locations are always very good 
R0001,"We arrived and our table was not ready which given the time off year it was no big deal  The food was very slow we finally got our main coarse at 10 20pm having arrived at 8 30pm   We were not all served at the same time and 3 of the steaks were not cooked as requested which was disappointing  the mash and veg were cold  We were served a glass of prosecco as a gesture  One of the party had to change her steak for a sirloin as they ran out of fillet steak this was not reflected in the final bill and we had to ask of it to be changed  The staff were very attentive and efficient  We were shown downstairs to finish our drinks after dinner were we secured a seat at the back of the room so we were happy with that until this rude aggressive nasty bouncer approached us as roared at us to �get up out of the seat now they are reserved� to say we were taken aback by his manner and demeanor is an understatement  There was never a reserved sign in the table and we were just bullied out of the seat by this bouncer to accomadate someone else    I dont know if it is policy to treat your customers in this manner but 
Myself or my family will never be back to your establishment again "
R0001,We did the 3 course price fix for 30 Euros  We also had glass of wine and a Guinness  Food was great  service was great   and price was great  Thanks
R0001,We have been there a number of times and never disappointed  Jonnie especially is always attentive and full of laughs 
R0001,We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch and the staff were great  The restaurant had a lovely ambience and we will be back
R0002,After booking online when we turned up the chef was not there so we had go elsewhere 
R0002,Amazing  as always  Staff and food selection and presentation were perfect and delicious 
R0002,As always  the food and the service were excellent  Great value for money  War and cosy on a cold night 
R0002,Delicious food and excellent value for money  Great for a catch up with friends 
R0002,Great little restaurant with great friendly staff
R0002,Great place  loved the relaxed service  Food was excellent 
R0002,I received a voucher as a Christmas present for 3 course meal for 2  When I got to the restaurant there was a special menu for who had the vouchers This menu had very limited choice  choice of 3 starters 3 mains and 3 desserts  Noting I had pre picked out was on the menu I advise the waitress that I was annoyed that it did not specify on the voucher that we would have to order from a special menu  She said there was nothing she could do How can a voucher state you are saving money when you cannot order of the regular menu We had calamari this was overdone and the chicken wings were not very nice  We had the seafood linguine  not much seafood and garlic bread was tock hard  The waitress was very nice but the service was very slow we were in the restaurant for over 2hrs and waited 20mins before our payment for the bill I had my 9yr old son with me so it was a challenge to keep him entertained in this time 
R0002,"Poor poor poor

I ordered the breakfast  It arrived 30 mins later  Wrong order I asked for friends eggs  The staff were rude and made it seem like I was a hindrance to them "
R0002,Very enjoyable experience 
R0002,Wanted a steak  My husband had the tofu steak and loved it  Great service and meal  Happy we found such a charming spot   
R0002,We got the early bird  Dont think its a place of go to again for food but maybe for drinks  I had the tuna Tartar for starter wasnt a fan  
R0003,1st time visit had a lovely meal  and  enjoyed tasting craft beer  Would certainly recommend to friends 
R0003,Apart from the great beers and gins  I particularly appreciated the vegetarian options and the cheery welcome of the staff  We felt immediately at home 
R0003,"Great and novel choice of craft beers with many of them Irish  broken down by county 
Friendly service and tasty food "
R0003,Great food and service  They were also able/willing to modify some of menu to make it vegetarian  which was much appreciated 
R0003,Great place with lot of local beer  Friendly staff who is really helpful 
R0003,"I gave this venue a great review the last time but not this time  The food was very average  The chef must have changed  The calamari was very difficult to chew  My wife asked for her steak to be medium rare but what she got was north of well done  The homemade chips/wedges were al dente  My ribs were very dry and again overcooked  When the waitress saw how much was left on my wifes plate she asked was everything ok; I told her that about the steak  Her response was a cursory sorry about that and no more 

As the other couple could not join us we asked the waitress if we could use the voucher the following Saturday as it was one day after the expiry  She asked the manger and quickly came back and said no  You would think that after the poor quality of food and having bought  two drinks each before the meal and a bottle of wine with it they would have had obliged 
Also  we requested a table at the window and was told they would make every effort to fulfill our request  but no effort was made at all  There were tables available and we took the initiative ourselves and changed table to one at the window "
R0003,"Its just ok  Thats the best I can say  I came in on a Monday afternoon  There wasnt much of a crowd but service was still pretty slow  waiting 20 minutes to receive the bill after asking   I got fish and chips  which were pretty bland  A bit more seasoning would have gone a long way but these were absolutely flavorless  

Dont think I would return "
R0003,Just excellent service with incredibly friendly and knowledgeable staff  Just brilliant 
R0003,"Love their ""naked"" tortas  basically any torta with salad instead of bread   Great value for money and good for the paleo / primal conscious lunch"
R0003,One of the best bars in Dublin  Food is great  Irish craft beers on offer are extensive and the staff are a delight 
R0003,Staff and service was amazing and the food was beautiful
R0003,Staff were extremely helpful and pleasant   and the food was very good   Very good value for money  and a lovely atmosphere 
R0003,The bartender was a real jerk  First bad service weve had in Ireland  He was condescending and acted like he was doing us a favor 
R0003,The main courses were tasty but the mash potato was only luke warm  The desserts were terrible  we ordered a chocolate brownie and eton mess 
R0003,This is absolutely the best ramen I have ever had   �The broth was amazing   plenty of chicken 
R0003,"This is not my first visit nor will it be my last   Downstairs the pub atmosphere is great and upstairs is a little gem of a restaurant   The staff are knowledgeable and friendly and cant do enough for their guests   I would highly recommend it and I will return without doubt 

Mary "
R0004,"
A bit pricey in my opinion but not highway robbery  At a stretch its not a bad option  and granted I didnt try the pizza  but Im ready to check out other places in the area rather than returning here "
R0004,Highly impressed    
R0004,"FIrstly  my boyfriend and I were very confused when we showed up and the staff said they had no record of my reservation  Luckily  they did happen to have an empty table for two and we were shown to our seats  Weirdly  I got a confirmation email  two days later     to say that my reservation had been accepted 

Secondly  and most importantly  the menu online is completely different to what they actually have in the bar  We went expecting a casual restaurant offering steaks  burgers  lasagna  etc  but instead this is a bar offering bar food like hot dogs and nachos  which would be fine if thats what we had been looking for   We were so confused  thinking we were either in the wrong place or that there must be another dinner menu  When we asked the very nice waitress about the menu she said shed been working there for over a year and this had always been the only menu they had  
So then we had to try and find a walk in restaurant and put our names on the waiting list  We ended up being nearly an hour and a half late to a birthday party as a result "
R0004,Horrible   spent  Euro 80 in take away   i think that they bought their awards on the wall   youre better off going to Tesco and buying frozen chinese dinners
R0004,"I did not get the chance to eat at this place  as it was closed when my fiancee and I showed up  and therefore our romantic Christmay Day diner was ruined  as we eventually had to eat at a chipper 

I do not understand why the restaurant accepts a booking for a day that it is closed "
R0004,"Its a nice find for those wanting a break from sandwiches or pub food in the area 

However  it came to a disappointment  Its the only restaurant Ive been to that doesnt serve banchan  the side dishes   The Seafood Bibimbap came with very tiny pieces of previously frozen mini shrimps and squid cut up so small  The vegs were only lettuce  shredded carrot  beansprouts  and few tiny pieces of zucchini  It felt like eating warm rice with lettuce  with very little seafood  The miso soup that came with it was also quite tasteless  without any seaweed in it 
"
R0004,The food is mediocre at best  Had much better food on our trip at other places 
R0004,They were closed we took a taxi over and was dropped off stranded if you are going to be closed you need to turn off your online app reservations  Probably wont try again
R0004,They were so rude when I walked in telling us the kitchen had closed  and when I said  I had a reservation  they said they assumed I wasnt turning up and they expected me at 8 even though the reservation was for 8:30  I walked in at 8:29
R0004,Wouldnt honour booking as they said they were fully book  Dont book through online
R0005,firstly  the staff had no knowledge of our booking  but i must say they rectified this promptly  Thankfully  i had the confirmation on my phone   i found the selection of food presented to be very poor  The one finger sandwiche the bread was stale   the rest of selection was poor  very disappointing  would not recommend  The coffee was very bitter  would have liked more time to select tea  I had to remind the waitress that our companion was hard of hearing and to slow down when speaking 
R0005,Had a fabulous afternoon  The service was lovely  staff were kind and very attentive  The food was delicious  Had cocktails which were amazing
R0005,We had a lovely afternoon tea
R0006,"5 guests for Afternoon Tea  For a special Birthday 
The event room and Hotel are excellent 
The guests disappointed by the slow service and the bland presentation 
Considering the level of the Hotel  the presentation should be amazing 
The Tea doesnt appear to extend to the full Afternoon Tea  Only to the final deserts "
R0006,An absolutely amazing  once in a lifetime experience  Would highly recommend it to anyone traveling to Dublin  Pricey  but worth it 
R0006,Best experience in Dublin and we have experienced all other hotels 
R0006,"Charming  hidden gem with many culinary surprises  each one better than the last 
I throughly recommend you leave city centre to go here "
R0006,"delicious food   wine and desserts 
service was friendly and the atmosphere warm and unassuming despite the top notch quality of the food"
R0006,Engaging staff  wonderful food and really interesting feature of art inspired second course  Loved the complimentary art catalogue
R0006,Excellent experience from start to finish   Really enjoyed the Afternoon Tea 
R0006,"Excellent Hotel 5 star as far as we would rate it staff were very kind and went aove the call of duty
I certainly would go  back there again"
R0006,Excellent service  Great food 
R0006,Fabulous afternoon tea  Best in Dublin  Service was excellent  we had a beautiful afternoon 
R0006,"Felt room did not create a relaxed atmosphere for afternoon tea Very noisy constant traffic to the bar While service was good felt no attention to detail  water glasses not topped up  plates  and cutlery not changed after savoury course Had to attract attention for more tea/coffee Sandwiches were poorly presented   maybe open type aesthetically better Scones were cold would have expected them to be warm 
Have had afternoon tea in other similar rated hotels   felt this was only average While waiting staff were good and explained menu  they were not attentive once savoury course served "
R0006,"Friendly staff good food and service in a great setting just off the main road 
A nice little bar inside and a lovely courtyard for the smokers"
R0006,Gluten Free sandwiches did give the impression they were made some time previous  bread exterior dry and aged  Staff very friendly and attentive  Felt location was very dated and lacked spirit  not joyful and showing little Christmas spirit 
R0006,Great experience  Too much waffle about the art lol
R0006,Had a Christmas Dinner there   fabulous food and wonderful wine but be prepared for the bill   Did I feel it was poor value   no
R0006,I wanted to have a chat with my friend coming along whole way from HongKong  Other customers besides us had a new born baby  who kept crying  The chat was disturbed time to time  The staff kept asking everything okay too often  All I wanted to have a relaxed chat quiet mode 
R0006,I was delighted with the service and staff  Its a wonderful experience and I would recommend it to anyone 
R0006,"I was so looking forward to this   had a voucher so checked this at reception before going in   was assured it would cover the tea in its entirety   Got a nice table and was joined by a friend  Started off well but then a group of business men sat at the table beside us  They proceeded to open laptops and conduct a meeting   very intrusive   phones and laptops  We eventually asked our male server to ask one of them to close his laptop   it was right in our faces  He just banged it closed  changed seat  at same table  and meeting continued on  It spoiled our tea   there were signs on the tables not to use mobile phones   I couldnt believe the hotel did not move them to another location  We had some wine with our tea so when the bill came I was ready to pay for the wine but a ""drama"" ensued then with the waiter that the voucher only covered regular tea and not festive   I was mortified in front of my friend   I had already checked this at reception to avoid any such issue  Eventually he didnt charge us  extra 8 euro  but again the damage was done   I would have expected better  There did not seem to be adequate staff that evening   several times there was no waiter in the room and we had to wait for fresh tea   the food was just delivered once so very little work there 
The only bit that worked seemlessly was the booking process online "
R0006,"I would not recommend this  I felt it was exceptionally underwhelming  The only pleasant eat was the savoury offering although this was very unimaginative also  For the most part the sandwiches were made from regular sliced pan 
All of the sweet portion predominantly tasted the same which was stale and sickly sweet  Each of the signature art desserts pretty much tasted of nothing  
Overall I was extremely disappointed in the experience and would certainly never recommend"
R0006,Ok this is the BEST HOTEL by far in Dublin for EVERYTHING with the exception of the FOOD  I have had it before and it was more or less the the same experience  I also wrote to the hotel directly of my disappointment   The food is stodgy and cheap  It does NOT represent the hotel whatsoever and that is why I cannot understand why this type of food is still being served for this occasion  Most people had left half of their food on the plate  Far too much sweet is given and not enough savoury  But its also the quality of food that I have an issue with  It goes back to the old saying quality over quantity    A change of menu is badly required  My three colleagues who I had invited were in agreement  I actually wont mention the price as I actually believe if the food was changed you are then paying for the overall experience which as I stated at the outset is the best in Dublin  An honest reply given above 
R0006,"Ordered a delivery here at 9 on Wednesday the 13th of May 
By 11 30 the food still hadnt arrived  so I called the take out and they said that the person on the front desk had finished their shift when they took our order and they didnt put it through properly  
Would never order from here again  "
R0006,Our experience  was brilliant  The service was perfect   friendly but professional and very knowledgeable  The detail that went into each aspect was exquisite  particularly the second course of mini desserts inspired by pieces of art in the hotel  The atmosphere was very relaxed and we did not feel rushed in any way  Would highly recommend as a special treat 
R0006,Such a beautiful experience  We are regulars visitors to The restaurant and it never fails to impress 
R0006,Superb on all levels  A must experience 
R0006,the burrito was put together was awful  
R0006,The food was delicious  the service was impeccable  the staff were lovely and the harpist was first rate
R0006,The Hotel is lovely and so is its afternoon tea   superb 
R0006,"There were two things that disappointed me  Firstly  when making the booking I said it was a special birthday and I reminded the girl who rang me to confirm the booking of this  No special anything appeared to celebrate the birthday  
Secondly  we were seated in the inner room opposite the fireplace and beside a very busy walkway between the bar door and an staff entrance to a kitchen  perhaps  It made for a less than relaxing ambience  
My daughter and I had a nice time together and the girl serving us couldnt have been nicer or more attentive "
R0006,Very enjoyable and excellent service from staff 
R0006,Was nice but wouldnt be rushing back felt it was overpriced for what you got
R0006,We have had afternoon tea in many places and several countries  This art tea was one of our top 5 teas of all times 
R0006,We stayed at this Hotel for two nights in September 2018 and had booked afternoon tea  We were very much looking forward to it however this was sadly  one of the worst tea experiences weve ever had  The Drawing Room where the tea is served is noisy  uncomfortable  dated and freezing cold  and we were seated nearest to the fireplace    The food itself was not good either  The sandwiches and scones were okay but the desserts which are art inspired had zero flavor and we could not eat them  The tea was also weak with very little flavor which I simply do not understand  Although the staff was lovely  they seemed rushed / overwhelmed and that created a chaotic environment which made this dining experience anything but relaxing or enjoyable 
R0006,We were disappointed as given a RELIABLE recommendation  We came from Kildare  just for this experience for a special occasion The Art Tea was very effective and we loved the concept and enjoyed the desserts  but In our opinion overall  we would not recommend it even at a lower tariff 
R0006,We were very disappointed with afternoon tea have had much better at other hotels
R0006,We were very disappointed with the slow service between the 2 courses  After 1h15 minutes we had to ask for the second course to be boxed as we could not stay any longer  We did appreciate however when we were not charged for the champagne to compensate  but we would rather have eaten all our meal there 
R0006,What an amazing food  One of the best steaks i ever had  Big choice of wines  and beers  Not cheap but tasty 
R0006,While staff friendly  I felt the afternoon tea was rushed  tea went cold and champagne glasses and water glasses were warm  for price paid  could not see value   Hightlight were second course desserts presentation but unfortunately they were far too sweet and lacked different flavours   Terribly disappointed overall as I heard it was good from others 
R0007,"Food was clearly microwaved  samosa were steaming and soft  Papadoms cold and the pickles were just passed between tables without being replenished  Chicken was crunchy  naan was soft and again steaming  
Then the waiter decided to tell us that he was so hot that sweat was dripping down his back 

A horrible experience in what should have been a nice last evening meal in Dublin

Bill arrived but agreed to only pay for what we enjoyed  2 bears"
R0007,Great food  reasonably priced  great service  would definitely go back 
R0007,Nice quiet restaurant  cute and in a great location of temple bar  Staff are friendly and attentive  I would recommend 
R0007,Really enjoyed our night  Simple restaurant with gorgeous food and nice service  Will deffo be back
R0007,Very overpriced for the quality of food we were given 
R0007,We had a meal here with my wife  to celebrate my birthday  Slightly off the main thoroughfare in the Temple Bar area  the staff were friendly and welcoming  Food was delicious with a good selection of vegetarian dishes  I would highly recommend this restaurant 
R0007,"Woeful service  

Terrible food  

Over priced  

Would not recommend "
R0008," ""roast vegetable wrap"" had raw spinach  shredded carrots and green bell peppers  Perfectly cooked"
R0008,A fantastic day  the staff are phenominal 
R0008,"A must see Pub  never ending selection of whiskeys and beers 
Check if Irish Folk music is going to be played as it does add a relaxing background "
R0008,Amazing food and cocktails  great venue for catch up with friends  excellent service 
R0008,"At 6  we ordered a vegetarian set meal for 2  When I rang them at 7:30; they said the food was on its way  The food arrived at 8  with 2 missing items  I rang the delivery person to tell them that 2 items were missing and he told me hed get back to me  At 8:40  the restaurant called to ask if I wanted to just put the money towards my next order  I asked them to simply refund the money for the missing items  and they told me theyd have to physically bring me the cash rather than refund my card payment  so I asked them to just bring the items instead  They said theyd be back to the house with the missing items in 40 minutes  At 10  they called again to say the items were ready but wanted to know if I just wanted to put the money towards my next order with them  which I had refused to do an hour and a half previously  I told them that I would not be ordering from them again  and just wanted the money back  They did not apologise or offer any concession; instead  they blamed the rain  The rain  In Dublin 

At 11:45 pm  the delivery person showed up with the refund for the two missing items 

This is  hands down  the worst experience I have ever had ordering delivery from any restaurant in any location ever  Stay away "
R0008,Booked a table there for a date  We were moved to the bar upstairs as we only wanted drinks and no food  despite it being completely empty downstairs  and we had to spend our date alongside a bunch of underage teens   s is �strictly� over 21s     and loud music  Not coming back 
R0008,Brought my daughter here for 18th birthday lunch  Just the two of us  Very poor service  Had to ask over and over where drinks where  Only ordered two drinks as they took so long 20 to 30 minutes   Also condiments not brought out had to ask for salt pepper mayo ketchup  Was very frustrating  Was hard to get staffs attention 
R0008,Chicken wings were cold  first drink took about 20 minutes we got out starter before our drink   Rib of roast beef was dry and tasteless  followed by a terrible mohito that tasted like water  For been advertised as a cocktail bar the staff dont seem very skilled mixologists 
R0008,"It was odd to see other customers coming over and trying to help me or ask if I am fine  
Really upsetting in the service "
R0008,Disappointing as was my girlfriends birthday  rang on Friday asking for a cake +candle  also asked when booking plus   was mentioned to me on arrival whos  birthday it was no cake ever arrived disappointing  end to a good night 
R0008,Everything from once arrived to leaving was perfect
R0008,Food not great Burger was too dry and chips were soggy  Cocktails taste like there is no spirits in them  Dj was ok not great 
R0008,Food was delicious  very tasty  Drinks were lovely and the prices are very reasonable  Will definitely be back again
R0008,Food was good but expensive for what it was and the wine was poor quality 
R0008,food was just average  Staff were helpful  Wouldnt go back to be honest
R0008,Food was lovely front of house staff were great just bar staff were so slow and not very knowledgeable had to repeat my drinks orders several times and when I was leaving had to wait over 10 mins to get change after paying for food 
R0008,Food was overcooked  pasta sheets in lasagne baked hard  and not well presented  cream sause in lasagne leaked out    Service was quite slow   Wont be going back 
R0008,Fresh  hot soup on a cold  and  wet April day  Soup comes with bread and a piece of fruit  Staff Pleasant 
R0008,good service  but food  was very average for the high end price paid
R0008,Great burritos and quite filling  I love burritos and this place does it really well 
R0008,Great food and lovely cocktails
R0008,Great  waitress was nice and the meal was tasty
R0008,"So    the duck was nothing but fat  and not the tasty fat that you know you shouldnt like but do; the really fatty fat that you actually cannot stomach  The veg tasted of nothing  as did the rice which had no seasoning whatsoever 
I really wanted to love this place  I was genuinely so excited  But unless I hear good reviews from others in the coming months  I wont be returning "
R0008,Huge portions  good spot to go if youre hungry  Music was very loud  not what we were looking for so worth considering  Service was good  would consider again
R0008,I ate here on Sunday  Im a coeliac so I had a look at the website which said there were coeliac options available  I ordered a starter which was fine and asked if I could get a burger for a main  The burger came out with chips which to pointed out to the waitress  She removed th chips and asked did I want vegetables  I said no because I dont want a plate of vegetables  I then had a piece of meat with bacon and cheese and a few pieces of lettuce which was fairly disappointing  For dessert I asked about the chocolate Sunday minus the brownie pieces  I was brough out a bowl of plain ice cream  When I paid I was charged full price for an absolute joke of a meal  You should not be advertising that you have coeliac options available if your wait staff havent a clue what it is and you havent really any main meal / dessert options available  Im annoyed at myself for not mentioning it and actually paying full price  Defiantly will not return 
R0008,I found this gem on web  It deserves the 5 stars it has gotten from everyone else  Great service gorgeous food 
R0008,"I guess Ive tasted much worse  but Ive also tasted better and for much less  �Good Italian food does not need to be so highly priced  �Having lived with a bunch of Italians for 15 weeks in student digs and eating fabulous dishes made on very little money  I can attest to that  
"
R0008,I have been here a few times with friends for drinks  As a bar to drink at  it is simply okay nothing great
R0008,"I was very disappointed ive been before and really enjoyed it but this time around it was a different experience  
I ordered the Duck and found it very tough 
The toilets were very dirty  We had to advise the staff there was no toilet roll 
We found the service very slow 
Not a great experience overall "
R0008,"Issue we had was no kids menu  we had 3 adults and 2 kids  We were told that although no kids menu we would be given childs portions however we were charged full price for all 5  2 Cocktails included and 3 course meal for all 5 cost 220 euro which is ridiculous for 5 people  I said nothing as just wont return  This was our favourite restaurant up until now but value for money shocking   The Lasagne was like a brick  Rest of food was nice but again telling you kids portions and charging you full whack is not on 
feel free to reach out to me if any further questions"
R0008,it is always a great place to catch up with friends  Good music  nice vibe  great food and even better cocktails 
R0008,"It was New Years Eve and were setting up for the night  why take dinner bookings 
Sat down straight on to a pice of broken glass  it was sticking out of my leg like a comedy sketch with blood pouring out  Their response: sorry about that were a bit busy  heres a plaster 
A joke of a place  stick to 15 year olds getting drunk and leave the dinner menu "
R0008,John was excellent  He really made our evening  such a lovely guy with a great personality so warm and friendly  Thanks John 
R0008,Lovely food lovely staff  overall it was amazing experience 
R0008,Management was rude and dont really consider the customer  All they care about is getting as many people in as possible and their turnover
R0008,More like a nightclub than a restaurant  V loud  sticky floors and average food  Wont be returning
R0008,"Music was awful club music for dinner  Service good  got asked to finish the cocktails we had on table as the waitress held the new ones in her hands and put them down once we handed back the empty glasses  
Starters good  steak and fajitas very average not worth the price 
 Euro 5 cocktails good but so weak  had 3 and very little alcohol

Probably wont go back"
R0008,Myself and my boyfriend had a great meal for his birthday  Ive been a few times now and would definitely recommend it 
R0008,Never had such rude service in my lifeZ the waiter was horrible and we were ignored while customers who came in after us were served 15 20 minutes ahead  I will not be back
R0008,Our party of three had a lovely New Years Eve dinner  The food was really tasty and service was very efficient and friendly  We will definitely return 
R0008,"Over all my experience was terrible 


Firstly myself  and  3 friends arrived at 10:10pm  and  asked your staff member on the door  male  tall  and  dark haired  if they still served food and if a table was available  he replied with no sorry nothing available tonight  Only until 5 minutes later i went onto my the app app to see this place had several tables available at that time  I booked through online app for a table available at 10:30pm  Arrived back at 10:25 and there was a girl at the door which had also witnessed the man refusing us a few minutes before  i told her i had a booking and her face dropped as mine would too if that was me working there  

We were seated and order had been taken by a waitress who didnt quite understand our order too well and seemed to get frustrated  

One thing i will say is the food was really quick and really nice  just a pity about our over all experience  definitely wont be recommending to anyone anytime soon  "
R0008,Overall a good experience  ruined by waiting 20 minutes for drinks ordered before we even ordered our food  Server was rude when we asked where they were quite politefullt  Disappointing 
R0008,Plenty of managers and yet not once asked if everuthing was ok   got the feeling they just wanted to get people in  fed and out 
R0008,Really poor service and food was bland  Starters and mains were mixed up and we were over charged when presented with the bill  Meal quality was extremely poor for the amount charged per dish  Would definitely not go again or recommend to a friend 
R0008,Seating down the back for dinner is very overcrowded and therefore the temperature is very hot  Asked to be moved and the a waiter obliged and got us a new table 
R0008,starter was sent back  way to much salt  main course  the potatoes werent cook  staff were indifferent 
R0008,The first bite of the massaman was lovely  but on the second we realised that the lamb was actually quite dry  and the sauce far too salty  Too much tamarind  we concluded 
R0008,The food and service was amazing  We had a party of 6 and had the best celebration while eating some delicious  and very well priced  food 
R0008,The food for the price wasnt great value at all and didnt live up to the pricing 
R0008,The food was good but the attitude from some of the staff was disappointing  The man that showed us to our table rolled his eyes when I said I had a table booked and told him my name  He said he left a message on my phone earlier  I explained that I never got a message and asked what it was about  The man said that it didnt matter now as we were here  I asked for a second time what the message was and he told me to forget it  with a sigh   The same man took payment from me at the end of our meal  he was rude in manner and seemed annoyed when I said that I would like to pay with a card  Even though the food we ate was good and great value  We wont be going back 
R0008,"The only thing I liked about this place was the decor  The staff kill the atmosphere  Tumbleweed passed by my table   
The lunch was even a tiny portion and tastless  I could feel the waitress looking at my reaction as I ate  its like theyre waiting on the dissapointment  I wont be back "
R0008,the staff st the door were very rude  didnt tell us they had double booked the table and only gave us an hour to eat and drink will not be returning
R0008,The treatment from what I presume was management was appalling  My sister and her boyfriend ordered their food  and  went to an ATM close by when they tried to get back into this place they were told they werent old enough to be in there even though they had already been seated and were both over 18  They were eventually allowed back in  Food wasnt great and staff never returned to see if we wanted more drinks  I love the place for the lunch box but will never return after this  The only highlight was the lovely waitress who served us 
R0008,This place is a real gem  The food is simply spectacular  The service is excellent  The ambience is great  Superb 
R0008,Two people attended for dinner  My food was nice and cooked okay  However  my boyfriends was burnt and the garlic bread was not fully cooked 
R0008,Very bad service  rude staff members  Wasnt happy with the way I was treated 
R0008,Very disappointed in their customer service  We ordered 2 500ml bottles of coke  and were delivered the 330ml cans  We had already opened the cans before realising that they had given us the wrong size  so we called to complain and they told us theyd deliver us the correct bottles  �When they got here  they dropped off the bottles  left  and then came back to ask for the cans back a few minutes later  When we said we had already opened the cans  they then demanded the bottles back and said theyd give us the difference instead  20 cents   This was THEIR mistake  and they should have corrected it by giving us the bottles despite us having already opened the cans  �We were not interested in getting 20 cents back  we wanted the correct size bottles  �Any other restaurant would have just given us the bottles  Their customer service deserves zero stars 
R0008,Very young peoples place  Found food over priced for what we got 
R0008,"We arrived around 7pm 

We were seated a girl came over took our order the order was a bowl of Soup and Sirloin Steak and a tower burger 

The soup and steak arrived the steak was cold the girl who took the order didnt ask how youd like your steak when she took the order 

The Tower burger never arrived 

Ive had dinner in here before and it was great no issues this time was different "
R0008,We were eventually seated downstairs  the restaurant was very noisy  we got bad seating beside kitchen entrance  ignored by passing staff and the house cocktails were very small and not sure if there was much alcohol in them  Maybe we caught on a bad night but not sure if Id go back 
R0008,Will definitely be back  From the staff to the food it was fabulous  They couldnt do enough for us  Delicious cocktails just another reason to go back    
R0009,Amazing food  Service was very professional  Really impressed
R0009,"Big prices small quantities   
I ate here with a friend recently and was very disappointed  The food itself was very different and beautifully presented  However it was served on cold plates and the food itself was only tepid   My main problem was that the portions were tiny and poor value for money  The service wasnt great either  We had to ask for our wine to be refilled on a couple of occasions "
R0009,"The management should pay closer attention to their personal  The bartender was rude at the beginning  which i thought is ok   and then a huge pile of dirty glasses was fallen on me because a poor waitress slipped over on the floor and almost fell  Noone even apologized  It was odd to see other customers coming over and trying to help me or ask if I am fine  
Really upsetting in the service "
R0009,Did the 9 course tasting menu  was still hungry afterwards  food was ok  the wine was better  a draught kept blowing in the door to our table every time someone opened and closed it which was quite often  Very expensive
R0009,Excellent in every regard  A beautifully appointed  comfortable and calming interior  friendly and personable staff  and delicious food  Highly recommend 
R0009,Excellent service yet again  The food was beautifully presented and the flavour combinations were outstanding 
R0009,Fantastic lunch with wonderful service
R0009,"First time visit   food was good but very little by way of service such as explanation of menu items  When asked for information waitress had to go off and check and took our order by writing details on her hand 
No wine recommendations and returned after we placed our order and told us we had to order vegetables with our mains "
R0009,Great ambiance  food and service  Would highly recommend a visit 
R0009,Great food and fabulous service  a very pleasant experience  A very helpful and friendly waitress had a nice evening 
R0009,To finish the night off  they messed up our desserts  which were the only good thing we ate BTW   messed up our bill  and throughout the meal my seat was continually bumped into and pushed by the staff because they have the tables so cramped together it is impossible to walk between them without needing to push them out of the way 
R0009,Ive been with my friends  Great value  The food was so tasty  Service was excellent  Definitelly will be back
R0009,Just lovely  Absolutely delicious meal  Beautiful presentation and amazingly creative  Highly recommended for an evening of fine dining 
R0009,"Once you decide to go to a high end restaurant in Dublin Amuse is a great choice 
Wine very reasonable in light of quality "
R0009,"Our family were on our last night of vacation   From the moment  we entered the restaurant  the waiter was rude and condescending   We asked for assistance with selecting a bottle of wine   The waiter refused to give us any information  other than  ""that one is from Spain  and that one is from France""  He continued to be rude  so we decided to leave  He was quite happy with our decision   and said we didnt need to pay for the wine   It was also clear that he was not rude and condescending to others in the restaurant "
R0009,"Overall we thought the standard of food in this French/ Japanese fusion restaurant was very good  It challenged our pallets and was beautiful to look at too 
We had a number of issues that would ensure that we do not return; firstly the drinks choice was limited to French wine  as someone allergic to French wine  this disappointed me greatly 
The first of our many courses were delivered in very quick succession due to the limited number of diners when we arrived  by the end of the meal we waited 20 minutes for desert  not ideal 
The waitresses were very quiet and really only focused on food delivery or clearing dishes  they did not notice empty glasses or offer more drinks at all 
The main issue with the restaurant on our visit was the atmosphere  it was entirely dictated by the head waiter/ sommelier; he was loud and over bearing  and totally over powered the small restaurant; he also had regular customers at one table that he gave at least half his time to  I my opinion discreet and attentive would have been a much better option "
R0009,Superbly prepared food  freshest of ingredients  remarkable combinations
R0009,The restaurant was very quiet for A Wednesday  There was a group of 6 or so and ourselves and when the larger group left we were on our own so the atmosphere was not great  We were served by three different staff and I would have preferred some consistency  As we left at 915pm one of the wait staff was smoking outside the door   not a good impression  A special starter was squid which unfortunately was so chewy that it was simply not enjoyable  I had enjoyed squid very simply done in a tapas bar in Seville a few weeks ago and it was far superior to the offering here  Main course was a little better  However the mashed potato was Luke warm only and the pheasant was cool  There were so few of us in the restaurant that there really was no excuse for the food not being hot  My dessert was novel in creation but nothing amazing  I had been looking forward to trying this place but was  disappointed by the food and the ambience  especially as dinner here is not an inexpensive proposition  My friend wants to give it another chance 
R0009,This is a great place for foodies  Very delicious and inventive food  Highly recommend 
R0009,Very nice and cozy restaurant with excellent food  I will definitely be back here on my next Dublin trip 
R0009,We had a fabulous night guided by Darren  We chose the tasting menu and it was a revelation   This is a great restaurant  get there before everyone else finds out 
R0009,We had a most beautiful tasting menu  Amazing flavours on every plate  The venison was sublime  Already deciding when to book again 
R0009,"Went back to crack bird as I loved the food there and the service  until yesterday    brought my girlfriend there for much needed dating time and so on  arrived at 20:45   at a table by 20:55  so when we seen the people who sat down after we did get their food first still no sign of our food  by 22:10 there still was no food we where over an hour waiting  no staff member came to us in regards to what happened and why the food is late  what annoyed me even more was I heard one of the staff members say ""they have been waiting on their food for over an hour"" simply ignorant and no courage to at least tell us its delayed   it would have made all the difference  but they didnt so it made it experience worse    the food it never arrived  we the last 6+ left at 22:10 we took it upon ourselfs to leave  never have I received such bad customer service in all my life   As a loyal customer to this place for the last 3 4 years I will never set foot in that place again  I hope the owner can see this  As he/she would really want to reevaluate the staff employed  "
R0009,Wonderful food and ambiance
R0010, Ive been here for the jazz brunch and the dinner and personally I prefer their brunch options Hands down the best eggs bendict in Dublin: the chips�are skinny  crisp�and fresh  the bap is amazingly fresh and the Hollandaise has�fab flavour  Nothing bland or boring about it  The sausage sandwich and Brioche French toast are also great options For dinner before I got a hummus plate to share which I loved but the 66 burger was really bland and the meat was disappointing Would recommend as�a reliable brunch option
R0010,1st time was awesome  this time the service was very good and flexible 
R0010,A girl behind the counter who wasnt even making our burrito asked my boyfriend for his name to write on his burrito but didnt ask mine funnily enough  She made a whole charade about his name  refused me the student discount and then when my boyfriend had collected the change and burritos  A couple of minutes later  we realised the receipt was in actual fact the girls number and something written in Spanish on it  I was so angry and threw the burrito in the bin  Horrible  disrespectful staff  Ive no interest in giving such people money 
R0010,"Although everybody was very friendly  service was extremely slow  Took us about 30min just to get the starters and then about 1hr for the main course  
Im assuming it was to do with the kitchen as waiters were always around making sure we had our drinks topped up  and never took more than a minute to get a waiter when calling them over  
I felt the food  in my specific case the pizza  extremely average  not fitting with the prices  
I love  other places  so was a bit disappointed with the place "
R0010,Amazing Saturday brunch with a friend to catch up on our lifes events  Food amazing  well served  great fresh juice and fabulous service
R0010,As a regular and enthusiastic luncher until about a year ago  I was glad to have the chance to return with a group of friends for dinner  Decent starters and wine were followed by bland mains which we would have eaten without complaint but for some horrible service/manners from one of the waiting team when one of the party asked for some sauce to enliven a dull fish dish   After speaking to the manager  the service charge was removed  however  we certainly wont be back  Very disappointing 
R0010,Asked for no dressing on my salad  which was very small for a main dish   and got it full of oil  event the second time around   I gave up and ate it full of oil   
R0010,"Birthday 
Great spot lovely sitting outside on the canal"
R0010,"Came here for lunch on a Sunday  Was placed at the outdoor terrace which looks so beautiful  Very nice interior design and concept throughout the whole place  Really amazed when I first stepped in 

I was really disappointed in the service whereby we were waiting for almost an hour for our food to arrive  Not even a slice of bread was given during our wait  The restaurant was not even busy or full during the time that we went 
Doubt Ill be back here again "
R0010,"Even thought my last experience was not quite what I was expecting  I am still recommending this place 
Hopefully the next time  anything listed on the menu will be available and if not  the waiter should warn customers beforehand "
R0010,Excelente atmosphere   High level of service   I will come over again 
R0010,"Expensive and obtuse  but whatever they bring to your table tastes pretty good 

They forgot to bring out part of our order  and we never ended up getting it  The food that we did receive however  tasted pretty decent  But what good is only half of the brunch you ordered  

The staff were not attentive and didnt seem to care where our food went 

My wife and I each ordered the pancakes for brunch  with a side of bacon   I wanted to put in a coffee order as well  and hopefully have a couple of cocktails  

Someone came around and dropped off our pancakes and left in a rush  but that was it  No one ever came to check on us 

We called over multiple wait staff to ask when our bacon was coming  as our server had disappeared  and it had been 10 full minutes of waiting; our pancakes were cold now   They all said ""well make sure it comes right to you""  to no avail 

Finally  when we gave up and asked for the bill  our original server came around and said ""Oh  theres no bacon  Ill go tell them to make some now "" We ended up getting her to remove it from our bill  But the bad service wasnt over 

My wife wanted to pay for the meal  After waiting 10 15 minutes for the server to return with a machine  at this point the restaurant wasnt really busy anymore   the server handed me the bill  However  my wife pulled out her card and popped it in the machine  only for our server to hand the machine back to me  After I gave it to my wife to key in her digits  our server handed my wifes card and receipt back to me  She paid no attention to my wife whatsoever 

She was clearly clueless as she delivered the wrong drinks to the table next to us as well  She wasnt apologetic  and seemed to have the ""oh well  I dont care"" attitude 

Weve been there once  and gave them the benefit of the doubt the first time  There wont be a next time "
R0010,"First parmesan chicken salad came out covered in avocado  menu did not say it had this in it  I dont eat avocado and would never order anything with avocado in it  So sent it back  Said they would do a fresh one  Came out in 60 seconds  Wasnt fresh as chicken was burnt on places and over cooked  However I didnt send it back  Pasta special carbonara not very warm and pasta somewhat congealed  Like it had been ready a while  

Table next to us got carbonara and it looked a hell of a lot different and better than the dish we got  Mainly work people on lunch in there but we werent part of that group  My advice dont go at this time  Unless u want fast food served up to you but quality of what is sent out not checked  It may be better in the evening "
R0010,Good service from  helpful staff  Food is good but over priced
R0010,Got a takeaway from here tonight  worst Ive ever had  also probably the most expensive as well  I cant fault them for the delivery driver not knowing where I live  as no delivery driver ever does  The portion of chicken curry was the smallest Ive seen  half the size of what Id be used to  which was no great shame as it completely lacked any flavour anyway  Chicken balls were soggy and bland  boiled rice and prawn crackers were obviously fine  although again the smallest portion of prawn crackers Ive ever had  A Chinese that cant do chicken curry  rice  and  chicken balls is unforgivable in my book 
R0010,Great ambient  Food only average  Not many lunch options 
R0010,"Great breakfast sandwiches  nice rashers and sausages from Ed Hick  Really well put together sandwiches  and the coffee is very nice  good full espresso 

Best breakfast in Dublin  I will check out the lunch shortly "
R0010,Great brunch and bloody Mary to cure the hangover  Nice place to chill on the outside terrace 
R0010,Great looking place and good service but poor menu  Few healthy options  no soup starters or salads  Cant decide if its an upscale venue or an expensive pizza night out  Main courses close to 30 euro and over plus another 4 50/5 for veg  Poor dessert list  
R0010,Had the buttermilk pancakes which tasted more like rubber  Clearly reheated at least once  Very disappointing 
R0010,Had the displeasure of watching the chef cook dinner for another table while re adjusting his manhood and then repeatly dipping his finger into the sauce he was cooking and licking it to taste the sauce  wiping his finger in his trousers and repeating after adding seasoning with the same hand and finger he had licked  Made me cringe  I get that he should taste the food as he is cooking but use a spoon and never redip it  Surely this is basic hygeine taught in college  Thankfully we had pizza which had been cooked by someone else 
R0010,Had the Lamb Shoulder  Tasteless  very fatty and minuscule  The bread was so hard it couldnt be cut  The remoulade had far too much sauce and was severely lacking in flavor  Im writing this review because none of the staff bothered to ask us if we enjoyed our food  I was a big fan but alas  no more  
R0010,Heard about the pancakes and French toast  It was a tremendous disappointment  The pancakes were the equivalent of eating a car tyre  Extremely dry  rubbery and tasteless  French toast was no better  watered down chocolate sauce  The price was extremely exspensive   Euro 12   considering the best pancakes in the country are in Juniors down the road for  Euro 7  Staff were extremely understanding and very polite  Food was very poor 
R0010,"I dont think I can get across how bad this brunch was  but Im going to try  

 The porridge my friend got was completely inedible   bland  undercooked and visually unappealing  It was just horrific  She had three mouthfuls and had to stop   gloopy slop  

The sourdough bread with spinach  mushrooms  poached eggs and hot sauce that I ordered was also horrible  and the biggest mistake I made was that I ate some of it instead of sending it back  

I dont even know where to start   the poached eggs were over cooked and under seasoned  the mushrooms and spinach were tasteless and soggy  the bread was burned and soggy as a result of the spinach and the hot sauce was the one of the most disgusting concoctions I have tasted in a very  very long time  

To top it all off I paid  Euro 15 50 for food that I couldnt eat and I would have been able to cook 20 times better myself  A waste of money and calories  

I dont know how this place has a good reputation  because not only was the food below par  the service was diabolical  The server was uninterested and rude and just about grunted when spoken too  

Very disappointed with this brunch  a glorified dump   safe to say I will not be back again "
R0010,I have no idea why everyone is going crazy over this overrated place  It sucks other places are much better but instead of going to these Mediocre places  BEST AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD in Dublin  Booking is so overrated and the bread sucks and the meat is dry and chewy  Dont even bother and the servers are so rude
R0010,"I regretted not looking up the reviews ahead of time   family was hungry and whining and we opted for the first place near by 

1 Star for horrible bland overpriced food 

The burger was dry  over cooked  and nasty 

The fries were cold 

Stay away  Go somewhere else   anywhere else "
R0010,I visited on Saturday night and it was not a good experience   Table booked for 9 30 and we were not seated until 10 05pm   Waited another 15 minutes for drinks and order to be taken   Given menus and ordered and was then told that they were the wrong ones and the dishes were not available   Service extremely slow   waiter commented that this place is crazy tonight   Food was of ok quality   ordered an avocado salad that arrived without any Avocado   Overall their was a good atmosphere but the service and average food made it a very disappointing evening   We were also seated close to the main door so were in a draught   were frozen by the time we left   Will not be going back 
R0010,I was looking forward to a special treat but I was disappointed by a very slow service and small portions  We ordered extra side orders to complement but they were tiny too  The menu is great though and its a beautiful setting  I wouldnt go back
R0010,I went with a group for a meal  We were all outstanded by the level of poor service  Like we were waiting an hour to b seated  An absolute disgrace  If that wasnt bad enough we waited along long time between our courses  I ordered Bruchetta  and the Spinach Lasagne  The Bruchetta i wasnt satisfied with it  Not the normal one i know  I enjoyed the Lasagne thou  That was heaven  I wanted a dessert but i just waited too long to order it  This was at half 10  I doubt very much it was homophobic considering it to happened on our special day Gay Pride  They had only 2 chefs and a handful of waiters/waitresses  They knew very well there was a large group being reserved  Total disgrace 
R0010, I wasnt impressed at all
R0010,"Ive just eaten again in this restaurant  The food is reasonable  however  this is the second time that a girl with the black hair  was up   not sure where she was from but took me a while to understand her had major attitude  

Seriously  she is nasty and very impolite  Any question I had over my check or food was met with eyes rolling  sharp responses and the card charger thrown at me  

She doesnt do the restaurant any justice at all  

I will most definitely NOT be back "
R0010,Like Fawlty Towers on a bad day  Third bad experience  Wont be going back 
R0010,Lovely evening meal with family  Service was great and food excellent  Second time there in a few weeks and we will be back again  Lovely ambiance and chilled atmosphere 
R0010,Lovely venue  but as always with the press up group restaurants  the food was poor  Soggy salad  Bland and tasteless chicken filet sandwich  Only one salad option  Such a pity  Our expectations were low anyway  but the prices remain high 
R0010,Lunch was not as good as would expect; chicken salad contained a lot of gristle  Dressing was not fresh / homemade  Salad was supposed to include avocado but none was included  Disappointing 
R0010,Nice ambiance  Spacious  Prompt service  Good food
R0010,One of our party ordered a chicken burger and was served a raw chicken fillet  When she told the waiter we barely got an apology  The burger was changed but that was the last we heard about it  We would have expected the manager to come over to apologise or someone to acknowledge the fact that they had served a raw chicken fillet which is obviously very dangerous 
R0010,Our service wasnt great and for some reason there was a 36 euro service charge on a bill of about 142 euro 
R0010,Our waitress Charlie was excellent but bar staff very poor and there is a general lack of interest by the staff in general
R0010,Our waitress was lovely  really outstanding but the food was abysmal and every time the door opened we were blasted by icy cold wind even though we were seated halfway down the restaurant  Would never return  Food is well below par 
R0010,Poor service  the waitress was acting arrogant and send us away after 1 hour and 20 minutes in a very arrogant way and extremely impolite rolling her eyes  I will not be going back soon because of this experience which is too bad because I like the space and food 
R0010,"We got inside and it was freezing so we asked the waitress if she could turn on the heating and she replied ""Im so cold as well  Ill try to ask the manager"" but the heater was never turned on  It was the 4th of January   
Our food was gross and disgusting  they basically buy frozen food and microwave it 
Stay away as much as possible from this "
R0010,really good nice atmosphere  food excellent  overall a positive experience  would call again
R0010,Rude little French guy behind the counter making fun of us and being really bad at his job  Food was greasy and over priced  The guy really ruined the meal 
R0010,"Service was appalling for a time that was quiet  
We got our starters before the complimentary bread before meal  my sister had to go get water  my steak was over done and too salty but couldnt get any server to come over so ended up eating it  ordered coffees had to ask for them 3 times  asked for the bill three times eventually went up to the desk where 3 lots of people were waiting to be seated and supervisor eventually came over  told her and she just said shed pass it on  For a pricey enough meal I was very disappointed "
R0010,Service was extremely slow  90 minutes to have a 1 course lunch and coffee  salad was small and not filling at all
R0010,Staff are excellent and very friendly  Pizzas are very bland and lack flavour  Disappointing
R0010,The best sushi Ive had in Dublin  If youre in Ranelagh its worth a visit for first timers and sushi veterans alike  No frills little place  but the food certainly has plenty of character 
R0010,The duck was hard to cut and eat  Service sometimes were too slow 
R0010,The food is very poor  the decor is the only reason this place gets any business Id imagine  Whomever thought replacing the sauce on a pizza with sweet potato puree  either has no tastebuds or is fairly sadistic  Bonus points for sitting us beside the old man who plus one was an escort 
R0010,"The food was appalling    
There was no culinary skill evident at all in either the starter or the mains 
The main course of Hake and Jerusalem Artichokes was abysmal and we left most of it on the plate which the server did not comment upon 
We were charged nearly  Euro 200 for two and felt as if we had been robbed at gun point  "
R0010,The pizzas were amazing and the crust was nice and crunchy  The staff was also nice and I would definitely recommend this place 
R0010,The pork ribs are outstanding  Service is good  Excellent choices on the menu  Plus apparently now 2 for 1 cocktails Monday to Thursday 
R0010,"The service was extremely poor  we asked fo  a table on the terrace and were told it was booked out  They proceeded to seat us at a table inside overlooking a free table  for the entire duration  of our meal  
I ordered a chicken salad and had to send it back as there was 3 tiny bits of chicken  the waiter said they must have forgotten the chicken "
R0010,The waitress that served us with blonde hair was extremely nice and gave us fantastic service for all our needs
R0010,The waitress who greeted us was beyond rude  Snarled  Told us our booked table wasnt available and stormed off  Ive never known service so appalling  We will never return 
R0010,The worst food and the worst customer service ever in Ireland  Avoid this place  Food is disgusting  we could not even eat it  when we were complaining they were unhelpful and blamed us for not eating their dog food  but honestly dog food is more delicious and looks better than the overcooked huge pieces of noodles with tough chicken and 2 tiny piece of defrosted vegetables    And the customer service is worse than their food  blaming the customer for not liking Chinese food  honestly this is everything but not food  so no thanks  and I really hope you think twice next time before blaming people who PAID for you  Shame on you 
R0010,This is the 3rd time eating here and I wont be going back  the restaurant wasnt busy and we were given a table next to a outside door opening onto a terrace so were constantly getting a draft  The food was ordinary  The ladies restroom was not clean 
R0010,"This place is at a nice location  designed with high style but suffers from staff that do not want to service the customer and blatantly ignore you  This is not a one time issue my last three trips have been like this but ive gone back because the food is nice  The staff are walking around and look at you  you can grab eye  wave but if its not of interest they do not come over  This trip we waited 20 mins to order  never received any water after requested  

Based on the other restaurants in the area  I would not return now and wait to see some good reviews that the staff issue has changed "
R0010,This was my third visit and will be my last  Although the woman at front of house was really friendly and pleasant  our waitress was not  We felt like an inconvenience to her  be it ordering some water or more wine or asking questions about the menu  It was clear she didnt want to be there and made us feel unwelcome  One of my friends is a coeliac and when she asked about french beans being coeliac friendly  she rolled her eyes and said you must be new to being a coeliac  because my friend didnt see tempura in the title   As a whole  our lunch was ruined and we will not be returning
R0010,Very good food and very friendly and professional  staff 
R0010,Very nice venue with great atmosfere outside  along the river and good value food  Very nice the Italian waiter Gerardo 
R0010,"We arrived on time for our booking at 8 and were told to take a seat at the bar while our table was prepared  The waiter did not check whether or not there were seats at the bar before directing us there so we were left standing  At 8 30  following no other communication from the staff  I eventually asked the waiter whether he knew when our table would be ready as we had been there for half an hour waiting  
He said he had forgotten and that a ""breakdown in communication"" between him and his manager meant we were left sitting for 30 min despite our table being free  In a restaurant of this apparent quality I would have expected more from the staff  He was entirely unapologetic about this mix up  we were there to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and it completely delayed our plans for the evening  As we were there in the run up to Christmas we were both very understanding of the fact that restaurants are busy and plans might change  but being left to stand at the bar for 30 min with no follow up from staff is not good enough "
R0010,We had a great time at this place  We had the best waiter  I think he was called Mario  He was Croatian and he was so attentive to us and made sure everything was perfect without being overbearing  He also made conversation with us on where to go on our next holiday to Croatia  The food was incredible  Im allergic to nuts and they took extra care with my food and still tasted amazing  The atmosphere was alive but not too noisy that you couldnt talk  It was so good we came back for a second time the next night  The waiter was thing that did it for us  The service was incredible I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to dine in Dublin 
R0010,We wanted to sit out in the balcony and the place was not loaded at all  however we were told we cannot  Hence we sat inside  while the waitress assured she will let us know once a table becomes available in the outside balcony  Later I noticed there were 2 tables available which would have been perfect for us outside  Quite a disappointment  because that was the only reason I booked this place 
R0010,"We were a group of six and unfortunately one and all were very disappointed by our experience in here
We believed our waiter did not engage with us and this is why we are mostly disappointed by our experience  
Our waiter was unfriendly and not very helpful when selecting from food menu  could have been more informative about dishes  and  sides and likewise with the drinks menu  
We thought it was overpriced for what we got  Euro 39 for a Veal dish and refilled bottles of sparkling water  Euro 5 a go 
We sat in the restaurant for over four hours and found the booth seating was extremely uncomfortable for four members of our group  the back of banquet seating is at a 90 degree angle to seat aesthetically looks the part but no way functional for diners  while the two lounge pull up chairs were very comfortable  
We also found the acoustics extremely poor  we were all struggling to hear the conversation and all leaning in and repeating parts of conversation to each other   
All in all I would say they need improving in friendly service  comfort levels and acoustics 
Thanking you "
R0010,We were five people  3 chicken burgers  1 mackerel dish and 1 regular burger  We waited 45min after ordering before the food arrived  Had to ask 3 people for our food  Beef burger was cold and half cooked  Waiter gave us a 20 percent discount which was a welcomed offer
R0010,We were really looking forward to it  Huge disappointment
R0010,"Went for lunch recently   its always been one of my favourite restaurants 
Service was appalling  I was embarrassed to have chosen the restaurant for our group  
Brunch menu until 4pm on a Saturday which comprises of egg dishes  bar the burger  is ridiculous  
Felt really let down and disappointed"
R0010,Went here for Brunch  Shocking food  burnt sausages  who burns a fry    rude staff with the exception of the hostess and the lady dressed in all black  Ive never experienced such bad service in my life  Would not recommend 
R0011,a lovely meal as always  a great  very authentic local Italian restaurant that is our families favourite restaurant   we always get a nice welcome and the food is always lovely we would highly recommend it 
R0011,Amazing food  best pasta Ive had yet  Will defiantly be going back soon
R0011,An excellent and genuine Italian restaurant  beautiful food and wonderful staff
R0011,"As always food fantastic and the service second to none
Highly recommended"
R0011,celebrated a family birthday and the food and service was excellent as always
R0011,"Excellent   great food and service  
Always enjoy visiting this restaurant "
R0011,"Great food   friendly staff  and excellent value 
Enjoyed our meal"
R0011,Great food  and  service
R0011,Great spot  Had a super meal on Friday night  Food and service excellent  Highly recommend this restaurant
R0011,Great straks Great place enjoyed it a lot 
R0011,Just collected an order from this place  just wanted to thank the manager guy who noticed that the staff member hadnt put any dressing in the bag �Saved me the hassle of going back  very observant considering he just briefly glanced and noticed  
R0011,"Met a few friends here for brunch a couple weekends ago  The menu looked amazing and the reviews were great; so I had pretty high expectations  Sadly they were not met 

I had the crab cake eggs benedict with a side of truffle creamed corn  We also ordered the red velvet pancakes for the table to try  The presentation was great  but my eggs benedict was very basic as well as being more of a sharing dish size rather than a main  The corn lacked any hint of truffle flavour and tasted like it came straight from the can  I hoped that the pancakes could turn things around but they were dry and kind of crispy 

A few other people in my group seemed to like their dishes  especially the brunch burger  but given that all three things I ordered were bland  I dont plan on returning "
R0011,Our first time in the restaurant and we thoroughly enjoyed it  Lisa was an excellent hostess and well be back 
R0011,We had high expectations before we went after reading many good reviews however when we got to the restaurant we were told that our table wasnt ready and we should come back in half an hour  Then we got no one to take order for ages and eventually when were ordering I had a question about one of the main courses the waiter said he doesnt know and needed to check with his boss but he never came back until someone else came over to us after further 15 minutes to take the order  Food I must say was very average on the night    my husband ordered a fillet stake and it was over cooked and tasted average  definitely not worth the money  However the bread at the start was very tasty so was the tiramisu we ordered  Nice atmosphere though  Im not sure if wed rush back anytime too soon 
R0011,Without shadow of doubt the best chinese food in Dublin  this is the real deal  Try the hunan style pork belly
R0012, I would recommend this place at all  Thumbs up 
R0012,Had soft boiled eggs and white pudding on sourdough with bacon on the side  The food was okay nothing special but it never going to be with the order and have no complaints over the chef  Service was arrogant and slow 
R0012,Lovely food and a welcoming atmosphere   We had brunch  where there was a good choice of food 
R0012,This was a huge disappointment  A group of ten friends arrived at his restaurant on Sunday morning  following a confirmation email I received  only to be told by the manager that he could not accommodate us and had not responded to the the app email   I will not be visiting ever again 
R0013,A serious great value  An amazing date night option  The food and service were both on point 
R0013,All of the food was great and served up with great professionalism  It is a great venue  and I recommend a visit 
R0013,Always a fantastic experience in this place   First time trying their weekend lunch and the steak sandwich is almost too good 
R0013,Amazing food and service  Atmosphere was great and again cant say enough about the amazing service
R0013,"Amazing food  great service 
Definitely will come back here "
R0013,"AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE
If you like falafels  dont order from this place  
We ordered falafel wraps  chips and a box with lose falafels  Everything was bland and soggy 
I the fillings of the wraps were equally as bland as the falafels and chips  I had to open them and add my own fillings  The whole idea of ordering take away is to NOT have to cook  Despite adding some fresh veggies and sauces to the wrap  I ended up leaving at least half of it and went to bed hungry 
Instead of giving stars  I should be giving this place black holes  It is the antimatter of taste "
R0013,Been here twice and burgers are great  Side sauces for the chips are also really good  Sex on the farm burger was my favorite if you like spicy food 
R0013,Excellent restaurant with superb food  We loved everything and it was within walking distance of our hotel 
R0013,Food as tasty as ever  Service top notch  Its a fantastic restaurant 
R0013,Great girls night out for chats and wine 
R0013,"Great service in a fancy environment 
A bit busy but excellent meat and nice wine list "
R0013,Lovely food and great staff
R0013,My second experience was not much better  Among family for a birthday dinner I proceeded to order the steak again  forgetting my last experience momentarily  The minute I cut into the steak I remembered exactly what had happened at my last visit and this was no different  However  this time I complained and was assured the steak was dry aged as advertised  I was given the opportunity to order another main course and decided on a burger as I thought I might have some chance of eating my meal with the rest of the table  30 minutes later a cremated burger arrived  Sitting there eating my burger I swore never to come back again 
R0013,Not bad at all  Im not a soda bread fan  but the food overall was good  Nice service as well 
R0013,Ordered burgers   the taste and smell of cheese was over whelming when I mentioned it to the supervisor he didnt seem to concerned about customer satisfaction  When he took out plates which were full I would have expected him to ask did we not enjoy the food but he didnt   Not impressed with this service or food
R0013,Our meal was fabulous  One of the nicest steaks I have ever eaten  I loved the old fashion feel of the place and the immaculate waiters
R0013,Our second visit here  this time our steaks were quite over cooked and portions sizes were small  Overall I would not say we got value for money this time unfortunately 
R0013,Quirky restaurant   Food first class  Very busy and hard to get a booking especially at the weekend  Staff very helpful and friendly
R0013,Really enjoyed my lunch today  fabulous monkfish meal  with a superb glass of Sancerre  Loved that there was a Petit Four option for dessert  Highly recommend 
R0013,Staff and venue is great  We ordered steak sandwiches but the meat in all three was very chewy  For a steak restaurant  it was very disappointing 
R0013,"Unfortunately when we arrived last Saturday night the kitchen was clearly after experiencing a fire and there was no hope of being served  However  the hostess claimed there had been a power cut     clearly this was not the case as there were lights on and all neighbouring bars and restaurants had lights on   She said we could sit down and wait but didnt offer drinks etc  Saying the bar couldnt serve anything  This was clearly not the case as waitresses were serving drinks all around us 

While an accident can happen  the way it was dealt with was really appallingly bad  We managed to get a table in a neighbouring restaurant and were told that this was not the first time this had happened  Unless the issue is sorted regarding fires / kitchen you couldnt really rely on it for a special occasion 

Disappointingly nobody has contacted us since to apologise or explain what happened and offer a table for another night  The place serves great food but based on this experience they really need to address their customer service asap "
R0013,Usual so good but they had a real off night this time  Our steak was significantly over cooked  The test of a restaurant is how they handle this and they did well  Still  very hard to rescue the situation  Even more frustrating when steak is a speciality of the house 
R0013,Valentines just amazing
R0014,Always beautifully cooked and presented dishes  Service is always top class  And fantastic value in a nice setting
R0014,Best coffee in Dublin as far as Im concerned  Nice friendly staff too that are up for a chat and a joke
R0014,Booking for 12 45 on s Sunday  wrongly assumed it would be brunch  Lunch menu wasnt great  We chose the monk fish and a carrot salad to share  2 mains   Tasty food but not v satisfying or substantial  3 bite size pieces of monk fish  Sides options was side salad or chips  v limited   Disappointed  Over priced for what you get 
R0014,Delicious food as always  Staff extremely pleasant a patient
R0014,Disappointing food and amateurish service in a beautiful restaurant  The food was virtually cold and tasteless  The brunch a la carte menu seems in fact same to be the same food available at the front of the store    served on plates at the tables in the restaurant  You come prepared to pay a premium for such a location and food but in this case its not worth  Bizarrely enough the quality of food is below the level of any other  location in Dublin  Apologies for being so direct in my feedback but its 100 percent constructive 
R0014,Excellent experience  Good food  good atmosphere and excellent service  Will definitely return 
R0014,Felt like we were dining in an upmarket food court that one might find in an airport  Or an executive dining room in a vast pharmaceutical business located in Ireland but owned in America  Lighting far too strident  Service was inattentive  The food  though adequate  wasnt so good as to justify the prices  Presentation seemed to be more important or than what was on the plate  A steak was cooked incorrectly  There was no complaint raised as waiting staff didnt visit the table to ask how it was  And it was a poor cut with around 20 percent of the fillet comprising an anchor of fat that resolutely clung on the last slice or two of meat  We ate our mains and left  with a promise to ourselves not to return  Funny thing is  we have enjoyed the Monkstown branch on multiple occasions without need to complain or feelings of regret  Maybe the formula is tired now or the fact it is a formula is  in essence  a turn off 
R0014,"Food very good   service fine   The NOISE was appalling   This place needs to realised that Irish people  especially the ladies  tend to scream at the top of their voice    We had to lean in to the table and bellow   Quite hard on the throat   This happened ; when I suggested  about 20 years ago  that something could perhaps be done I was told that would ""spoil the look""    Definitely shant be going again   which is a shame as quite convenient to me and good food "
R0014,Food was very good as was service  Choice on menu very limited   Restaurant was very noisy
R0014,Four of us visited this place because we had gone several times to its sister restaurant in Monkstown which we really enjoyed  We arrived at 7 15 p m  on Saturday 6th APRIL to find the front door closed and a small note to go in the rear door  There was no signage  We were shown to our table promptly but we had a long wait for service and it certainly looked like there was inadequate waiting staff  Service was extremely slow  Our starters were good   We all ordered fish for mains and when it eventually arrived it was cold and overcooked a sure sign of a long delay awaiting service  I should say the service when it arrived was always pleasant  At an adjacent table the were four adults with two children who proceeded to go round the restaurant on their scooters  This is casual dining but it is not inexpensive at  Euro 14  00 for a starter and  Euro 30 00 for a main course and at least  Euro 40 00 for a  bottle of  wine  I certainly did not come to hear screaming children scooting round on their scooters in a restaurant at 8 30p m at night  I will not be returning any time soon and would strongly suggest the restaurant gets it staffing policy and child policy right 
R0014,Great addition to Ballsbridge scene   looking forward to the summer weather to enjoy outside tables
R0014,Great food and service and a welcome addition to Ballsbridge
R0014,Great place for coffee   Soup was delicious but main courses on the skimpy side 
R0014,Had a great brunch here yesterday  The food was excellent and the staff were so friendly and attentive  Looking forward to going back for dinner 
R0014,Had dinner here last night  Great location and facility  Food was great and we all take some home due to the portions  Friendly and knowledgeable staff  Will go back here at the next opportunity 
R0014,I was looking forward to my first experience   but found lunch for two at Restaurant distinctly underwhelming   At one oclock the place was busy and very noisy  particularly the table next to us of four girls  who got louder and louder   Service was slow and waiter was average but certainly not efficient or overly pleasant   The food  Croque Monsieur  was also very average  the toast chewy and tough   The location is the best thing about the place   I certainly wouldnt be rushing back  but its possibly convenient for a cup of coffee or a drink or pizza if youre in the vicinity   Lets hope these observations are temporary teething problems 
R0014,It has been a long time that Ive been to such a nice place in Dublin   Definitely will go back  
R0014,It is worth a visit  Limited menu which means everything is fresh  They list all their suppliers  We always enjoy our trip
R0014,Loved our Sunday brunch here   Food was delicious  Service was excellent  A friendly and pleasant place  We will be back 
R0014,"Menu did not match what was on the app
Some items needed better explanation  Allergy and nutrition information on menus would be useful"
R0014,Really disappointed  I went for Sunday brunch with my friend  It was very noisy and we  waited a 1/2 an hour for our food to arrive  Its a very  pricey menu and there are not many options to choose from  I wouldnt recommend and I wont be returning 
R0014,"Terrible service  Coffees forgotten  A waitress whacked one of our partys head with a bowl  The baby bowl that we gave for the food to be put into was delivered to another little girl in the restaurant   

Speaking of children we order the pork ragu childs portion  First off there was absolutely no pork to be seen and  Euro 13 for a childs bolognaise is ridiculous  "
R0014,The new look bar is amazing  The same great atmosphere with a more polished refined look  Great service and clean 
R0014,"The restaurant was comfortable but due to the pressure on the shortage of staff the service was so poor 2 of us had to get up from the table and ask for a pot of tea  
Very poor service and limited menu could have  dishes for  celiac an more selection  Over all 2 stars  "
R0014,The service couldnt have been better  The food; although was good quality was bland and overall totally over priced which for what I would call a cafe restaurant
R0014,The service was slow had to get peoples attention after waiting 20 minutes without someone asking for a drinks or a food order  Had to ask for things twice like extra sauces etc  Food was nice though slow to come 
R0014,"Very limited choice on dinner menu  Service was very slow  One meal had to be sent back as steak not cooked as requested  and  the rest of the party had almost finished eating their meal  One person asked for an extra slice of toast for the duck liver parfait  and  was charged extra for it   We were overcharged on the bill for dessert though it was corrected when queried 
It was a cold night  and  the front door stayed open every time someone arrived or left  I would not be rushing back at least not for dinner "
R0014,"very nice food  first visit and looking forward to next one  Staff could be more trained but other than that  well done 

Dave"
R0014,We came and my husband had beers  I had a wine and one very impressive cocktail  This was impressive showmanship and the drink was delicious 
R0014,We had a lovely brunch  Great food  great service
R0014,"We had the opportunity to sample the best dishes from their menu 

We started off with a cocktail making session and our end result was an amazing pineapple cocktail  Then we were served pita bread with hummus  The hummus was smooth and had a balanced taste  Then we had jack Daniels chicken wings which were undoubtedly the most popular amonsgt our group  I personally loved the flatbread which had a generous cheese and veggie toppings on it  Highly recommended"
R0014,"We sat at back   door kept opening so big breeze permanently  fish was raw in centre  
menu limited and overpriced   sides are needed as portions so small but they too were overpriced  
as a result i cancelled a lunch i had booked for sunday  also talked to my friends who had similar recent experience  i definitely wont go back or recommend  not the usual experience  very disappointing "
R0014,"We went for a Saturday afternoon late lunch and were told the only menu they had was a brunch menu  Was very disappointing as I expected a much wider choice which would include some of the very tempting   food being served from the foodhall  In fairness to the mgr he did allow us to chose from the salad bar in the main part of the shop but the portions were small and the price wasnt  
Its a lovely place but Id only go back for coffee "
R0014,Wonderful setting and excellent staff  this was an unexpectedly superb meal  Weve always bee fans of this place  takes the standard of dining to another level 
R0015,Food was good and staff were great 
R0015,"25 minutes just to come and take our order  Arrived at 19h35  order taken at 19h58 
The food looked ok  My rack of lamb strangely had no rack    And was so tough  The portions were very small  so you need to order sides on top of paying  Euro 19 for your meat  
There were only 5 mains on the menu  Very limited "
R0015,Absolutely over priced  Crowded and loud  Our table was in a walkway and we paid over  Euro 150 per person for a very ordinary meal
R0015,Always have a lovely time whenever we come here  Just amazing service and food   thank you so much 
R0015,Arrived to a virtually empty restaurant   That in itself was not a problem  but our party of 4 were seated  quite close to a rear door   The cold was blowing round our ankles and by the time the meal was over  our feet were freezing  Food was lovely  Great menu  Great service  But lads turn the heating up 
R0015,Bad  Bad Bad  Dreadful service from the start  I dont need to be told five times before I get a menu that you need the table back in two hours  Waitress was unfriendly and had to ask everytime for service  Food is average and bad value for the price  If you want to charge  Euro 150 for two people including one glass of wine and a bottle of sparkling water you need to provide a better experience than this   
R0015,Disappointed with service  menu choices and value for money  We hadnt been in a while and were looking forward  but wouldnt go back  Main courses were the only enjoyable element  Staff more interested in talking to people they knew rather than being attentive  The old restaurant always had a buzz  but there was no ambience at all  Admittedly on arrival we were told there was a problem with the lighting in that they were too bright  Staff shirts/blouses were stained  didnt look professional  Very disappointed with the experience 
R0015,Do yourselves a favour and bring your burrito 
R0015,First the positive   service was very friendly  attentive and apologetic when the wrong bottle of wine was presented  Service charge is not added to the bill   another positive  The food was about average but not worth the price charged  The wine list is uninspiring  The big problem was the ambience   probably the worst table I have ever experienced  Table 16  number waiter wrote on wine bottle  is at the end of a tiny off shoot  facing a semi opaque window into what seemed to be a cleaners storeroom and a cheap lamp  The tables were cramped; conversation at the next table was overpowering  as was the music outlet overhead  Were we assigned this table randomly or does it reflect the restaurants attitude to a reservation 
R0015,"First time I went here it was Arthurs Day and I swore I would never go back after seeing some people having sex in one corner and 3 different guys peeing in various different corners  some onto peoples jackets   Last night I went back 

Drink deals are the only redeeming factor  Too crowded  the feeling that you might get robed  stabbed  or molested always hangs around  Confusing to get around too  I swear I walked back the same way and I ended up in a whole different room "
R0015,Great food with fantastic service  Will definitely be back 
R0015,I go here a lot but was a bit disappointed this time   Their grilled broccoli was more about the goat cheese mousse than the broccoli and their garden salad was far more bland than I remember   Im hoping I caught it on a bad night 
R0015,"I had been meaning to try this for some time and I seriously regret it  It is the single worst takeaway I have ever had the misfortune to encounter  

I was really hungry and felt like indulging myself so I convinced my girlfriend that we should order enough food to feed a small country  or at least a city state or principality   She called them up and ordered our feast and was told that the food would be ready in 5   10 minutes  That is where we should have realised what we were getting ourselves into  How can 50 odd euros worth of food be prepared in 10 minutes  

Avoid this place as if it were John Waters  If you like thai food then order from somewhere else "
R0015,I met a friend for lunch here today and got the burrito bowl  which for some reason costs more than the burrito   and was really not happy with any aspect  Every little thing above the most basic was an additional cost  they wouldnt let me swop beans for veg  the portion was pretty measly and to solidify the sub par experience it was the blandest meal Id ever had from a Mexican place  The chicken tasted of nothing  the guac was unseasoned and the toppings average but scabbily applied 
R0015,"I used toptable to book the restaurant on Saturday morning for Saturday night   not sure if that had any bearing on where we were seated  We arrived at 8 15 and got the worst seat in the house  Every time the front door was opened we got a nice frosty breeze  The waiter who served us wasnt great either  it felt like it was his first day 
"
R0015,I was a bit disappointed at the value  We went for a special birthday meal and compared to other restaurants in the area we cant see how the price could be justified for the quality of food we were served  We were there during the summer and enjoyed it much more then  but this time the food was only average  and I regret to say we wont be going back 
R0015,"I was a bit disappointed in this restaurant having heard so many good things about it  �Bringing your own drink was great  but that was probably the best part of the meal  �The dishes were on the slightly more expensive side  which would have been fine if they filled you up  However with a starter and main course down and my stomach still growling for more  by the time we had ordered dessert to fill the gap it had turned into a reasonably pricey dinner 

The food was nice  the falafel was delicious and the fish I had for my main was ok  but everything was too small and too plain for the price tag 

The atmosphere is a bit mad  we started off sitting in the back room on the couches before being moved to a tiny table in the corner  �It was fine  but the place was just a bit too hectic and everyone was just slightly too uncomfortable for the price "
R0015,I was not impressed at all the service was very slow and the food was not good  I would definitely not be going back and I would not recommend it to a friend 
R0015,It never fails to deliver   The front of house staff are excellent 
R0015,Its very over priced for what it is  Dont get me wrong I had sole as a main and it was nice but for  Euro 26 it should have been gorgeous
R0015,Let me say that I have only been here for two private parties and can only base my review on that  I have not experienced the normal food or atmosphere  so it could be different than for a private booking  
R0015,Lovely evening but food a little overpriced 
R0015,Menu very limited  beef dish in pre theatre menu not very nice
R0015,"My friend and I were out scouting for some good cocktail specials when we found Dandelion  They have a great drinks list with cocktails ranging from  Euro 5  Euro 10  My friend was so excited  she volunteered to grab us drinks while I held down a table 

10 minutes later  she comes back with a sour face  empty handed  I asked her what had happened and she told me she stood there for 10 minutes and nobody took her order  So I went ahead and ordered drinks at the bar  doing my best to get the bartenderss attentions  Standing there  waiting my turn  I noticed a few things:

1  They dont acknowledge your presence 
2  They dont wear smiles  like its illegal to have a curve on your face 
3  Their attitudes are incredibly sour 
4  They hate their jobs and cant be bothered 

After waiting  the bartender made a few glances and saw I was next  Then another person shows up and he helps her first  To which she insisted that I was there first  Because I was 
 Drinking the Skittle Martini brought me back to when I was sick and had to survive on cough medicine  I dont see myself coming here anytime soon  and neither should you 

Seriously  not worth it "
R0015,"New Years Eve    
Positively underwhelming  
Overpriced for standard offered   
Certainly would not recommend it "
R0015,Nice food but not worth the price  Much better options for same or less price
R0015,"Ordered a meal for myself and my wife  �Starter and Main came to about 16 euro each  �Waited almost 50 minutes for food  which arrived luke warm  and far from hot  �A sad statement since we live about a 5 minute drive away 

The food was overall quite bland  �Nan bread was doughy  �Madras was without spice at all  �Bland and very boring  �Samosas lacked spices/herbs  except the salt/spice combo sprinkled on top  �Also one of the few places around that will serve a curry without rice or bread included "
R0015,"Our pizza dough was uncooked  our ""salad"" was iceberg lettuce with some coleslaw and our fries were greasy and tough  Overall terrible experience  Never would recommend this place to my worst enemy"
R0015,"Overpriced  Starters tasteless and poor  
2nd time eating here  Gone rapidly downhill"
R0015,Poor food  service and value for money  Overall disappointing evening
R0015,Really poor customer service  Booking was at 20:00 seated at 20:20  Not given a drinks menu  coats not taken  long wait times between courses  Food was as always very good and to be fair we were given free desserts as a token of goodwill  However it was probably the worst customer service I have experienced 
R0015,Seated at 17:15 food did not arrive until 17:55  the food itself was OK  steak was cooked as ordered but overall it was just OK  I felt it was overpriced for what we received  there is far better places to eat in Dublin  probably would not return 
R0015,The ambiance is beautiful but  its a bit over priced for what you get  And the staff seemed annoyed with us because we asked to see a menu before we committed to getting a table   I dont think thats an unfair request  Also  upon paying for my over priced steak and prawns the server asked me if I wanted to add a tip and which percentage  which led me to feel obligated to tip her and subsequently bad tipping her the lowest option of 10 percent  Maybe its custom here but I think that decision should be the private choice of the paying customer and not announced in front of the whole table  Wouldnt go back  Mediocre overpriced food 
R0015,The most delicious food we had in Dublin so far with a very pleasant and professional service  I could not recommend this place more 
R0015,The place looks great on paper  however fairly sub standard service  They forgot our order nd left it sitting for an hour before I finally tracked down a waiter  Rushed the food  ad s result the food was completely under cooked and flavorless  Except for the venison that was quit nice   No apology for the oversight and also added a voluntary donation to local charity  All in all very disappointing   Worst restaurant of our week long stay 
R0015,The restaurant was under construction which I had not realised  We were brought  up to a small dining room which was nice but the corridors and stairs up to it were old and run down  Our main main waitress   a young female  was terrific and attentive but the there was another older man assisting her who was short mannered grumpy and bulldozing his way across the table to lift and place plates coffees etc  Really off putting I have to say  Starter was poor  main good and dessert great so mixed in terms of food  We had a NZ white SB which was lovely but pricey  Probably wouldnt be going back all in all   except for the great waitress and the chocolate dessert  
R0015,The service in entrance was friendly but during was a bit impersonal  The food was tasty but not value for money in my opinion  I was disappointed with that 
R0015,The smell from the stairwell to the toilets was just disgusting  The service curt the food small and the price way too much  I have been going  over the years since it opened and if they do not take a look at their service  clenlienss standard and the fact that while we were finishing our meal the Kitchen porters were dragging dirty linen across the restaurant floor just such a disappointment the entire eventing 
R0015,"This was a return visit on Wexford street having had positive experiences before  Itll �be my last  My fiancee and I arrived to a packed restaurant and were seated  Our seating arrangements were too close to the next table  The music was loud and not conducive to conversation  We were hounded SIX times for our order  Ive worked in the service industry  where a good rule of thumb is to wait until the customer has finished reading the menu before taking the order  Feeling hurried  I ordered just a cheeseburger  We split a half and half  
"
R0015,Very dissapointed with this place  I had heard a lot of great things about it and as a bit of a carnivore I was really looking forward to it  I got a very bland steak that I was way over charged for  You are charged prices as if you are in a nice restaurant and the food doesnt live up to pub grub standards 
R0015,Was really not impressed with this place  The place isnt laid out particularly well so can be a bit of a squeeze  Even with three servers and capacity at 65 percent  service just seemed to drag  When service sucks though you can forgive them if the food is unreal    But it wasnt  My friend ordered chicken tenders  which came out as a measly portion  barely breadcrumbed and terribly dry  Not tender at all  Both of us thought the fries tasted off too  as if they were fried in oil that hadnt been changed in a while  I usually really like this place as its normally good guilty food  but this experience really put me off 
R0015,"We arrived with anticipation and left with disappointment  
So much talk about the steaks yet both defied the descriptions   being undercooked relatively speaking  
It was ok   we have experienced much worse but wont rush back  Definitely over rated"
R0015,We had a late lunch today and only had raw oysters and pea/garlic soup   It was excellent   Great  personal service 
R0015,We went this restaurant on Saturday evening for a pre theatre meal and wee shocked to hear staff planning to sell glasses of wine to customers which was not the wine they had ordered and would pay for   A very memorable and appalling experience   One that we wont forget 
R0015,"We were a group of 6 women  all 40  meeting for our Christmas get together on Sat 15 Dec 

The restaurant asked us to keep the noise level down after we finished our dinner  We were a group of mature women  catching up  having a few glasses of wine and having some fun  Nothing more than any other group of women in the restaurant  

This comment was totally uncalled for  Id like to give you some feedback on my overall experience  

1  Received call from staff member on Mon 10 Dec to confirm our booking on Sat 15 Dec  The lady was speaking with her mouth full  She did apologise as she was eating chocolate  Not very professional for a restaurant that sets its standards so high  

2  Arrived at restaurant early  Before we sat down  we were told by the waiter that hed be �kicking us out by 7 30  We appreciate that a table has to be free for the next sitting  but again the way it was said was unwelcoming  

Overall  the food was nice  the experience as a whole was very disappointing and its a real shame because thats what you remember  We attended your restaurant on a recommendation  we wont be paying that forward "
R0015,We were seated next to the bar  which was very dusty and there wasnt alot of space to sit or move comfortably  We were a group of four and 2 of us ordered a steak medium rare  the stake came well done  Now this is something that can happen and really didnt upset us at all  But the way the mistake was handled was an absolute no go  They took only the stakes back  which meant two of us were eating and finished long befor we even got our stake  It took them about 30 min to bring us the new stakes  In the mean time they brought us other dishes that we didnt want and Prosecco even though 2 of us didnt drink any alkohol  When the stakes finally came we both only ate half of it because we were now full since the others shared their meal with us  When the server saw that  he seemed a bit upset and when he brought us the check and explained that he didnt charge for the stakes and for the Prosecco  which btw we didnt even drink  he was rather unpolite and acted as if it was our fault  Now I want to say mistakes happen and that really wasnt the issue  the only problem was how poorly they handled the situation  Also I want to point out that I had a stake the next day in a pup and not only was it perfectly made  the quality was also way better  So honestly Im really wondering why they have a star  or maybe they just got lazy after the got the star 
R0015,Weve been here before andhad a nice time with a good meal  So we decided to come tonight  after looking up the hours  the website said open until 10:30  We got there at 930  Lady was just like sorry were closed and walked away  I was like sorry what are the opening hours  i had read 1030 online  The lady couldnt be arsed to answer  The bartender was like oh the kitchen closes an hour early  Would you not put that on the website  Either way  ridiculous situation and whoever that woman was  she was totally unprofessional  There are loads of restaurants in the area  typing this from one now  and ill be in no hurry to return  
R0015,While this isnt the worst offender Ive seen for overpriced sushi  its pretty clear that youre paying for location and ambiance above most else  Pretty much any typical sushi item you order here will be between 3 5 euro more expensive than what youd get at a different location  which becomes particularly rankling when you see that their portion sizes for sushi are extremely small 
R0015,Whilst the the decor was nice  the ambience was awkward and felt like a wake at a funeral  The one speaker funnelling music into the room sounded more like an annoying teenager on the back of a bus with no headphones  Our Waitress was not overly familiar with the menu and was not able to offer recommendations  She was also unfamiliar with the offer menu we were dining on  My partner and I are not picky eaters  at all  but the food we were served left much to be desired  The paired cocktail choices on offer are advised against and dont arrive too hungry as there is quite a wait between courses  Very disappointed considering the good things we have heard 
R0015,Would I recommend this restaurant  not sure  I booked this restaurant for valentines day  I was informed previously that this was a 6 course taster menu so we also ordered the paired wine  The food was very nice  however they missed out a course  The waitress said that it was only 5 courses due to the time we were seated   7pm  That was rubbish as surely we would have been told that before we started  The supervisor offered the paired wine we missed out on and an extra drink  the paired wine unfortunately was one we already had  by this time I had given up the will to bring this to their attention   the bill was reduced also accordingly  Business lunch yes  romantic meal no   by the way it was my birthday also  Great Food Poor Service 
R0016,Absoutely amazing resonable price  and  decent pasta and wide range of selection  I definitely visit again 
R0016,Amazing  The staff was extremely generous and made us feel right at home  Food was great and the atmosphere was even better  Perfect for a Dublin date night 
R0016,Amazing  This was our favorite restaurant during our Ireland holiday  The staff were friendly  the food was delicious  and the drinks were perfect 
R0016,Basically you can play with the ingredients  just go there and try it out  Great value for money and superb taste 
R0016,"Beautiful experience in here  loved everything and they have nice wine too 
Staff perfect  Definitely will be back "
R0016,Chippery chipper  Good chipper  Everything else is battered  And it does what it says on the tin 
R0016,Excellent food and service   Good atmosphere and great venue  
R0016,FAbulous authentic Italian food in a lovely setting with excellent service 
R0016,Fantastic food  incredibly service and a very friendly atmosphere  would go again in a heartbeat
R0016,Food and wine is amazing 
R0016,Food was excellent  Very authentic Italian food and wine and service was amazing   Highly recommend   
R0016,Food was superb   All staff should be proud of themselves   The friendliest and most welcoming restaurant in the city   
R0016,Great food  service and wine selection
R0016,"Great location near temple bar area 
Fabulous food with excellent service and reasonable prices 
Authentic Italian food with many choices"
R0016,Highly recommend     food and service is exceptional
R0016,It is always consistently excellent  food  service and atmosphere   We have had some of our best family meals there 
R0016,Pretty good food  average prices for the area  Good traditional live Irish pub music  Great servers/staff  Geared towards tourists 
R0016,The location is lovely and if you get a seat at the window you have a nice view of the river  The food was good
R0016,This  is one of our favorites  we love the food and atmosphere  On this occasion the service wasnt up to its usual standard 
R0016,We had booked this restaurant as a treat but wish we hadnt bothered  The place was very noisy and the service was poor  We had to wait almost one hour for our dinner after the starters  I ordered steak it was tough and tasteless  We would not recommend 
R0016,We stopped here whole visiting Dublin with family and it was one of the best meals we had during our trip  The food was outstanding and the service matched  Highly recommended if you want a high quality  authentic Italian meal in the city 
R0016,Went in   in fairness staff were lovely and friendly  Ordered a cappuccino for myself and see got a latte  Nice too but fairly standard  Jug of water came too not long after with a nice added touch of a bit of fresh mint  I ordered eggs florentine  spinach in place of ham  while  my housemate got pancakes with dulce de leche caramel basically   No joke it took 35 mins to come to our table    it was like they forgot about us  Not one person came over to us  Food eventually came and it was incredibly basic for what it was  I could have made it myself  Very very disappointed in both our meals  The price was grand at 23 20 but I wanted so much more  Wont go back 
R0016,Wonderful food and service  A great change from the never ending burgers or fish and chips  Huge wine selection  too 
R0017,"went about 5 on a Sunday  the man behind the bar was very nice  ordered garlic mushrooms and sunday dinner   Carvery  there about about 10 people in there  After 40 mins the mushrooms came out  then  we had to wait another 40 mins for a Carvery  all it had to was be lifted on a plate  service is the slowest I even been to in my life  the norm is you stand at carvery and get it there an then  but one bar man  doing all the work  the sunday carvery was awful  the mash was nearly solid  the rest tasted like it came straight from a microwave dinner  Really bad have to say  the garlic mushrooms were just battered mushrooms with a garlic dip on side  straight out of a packet in to deep fryer  the nicest part was the bit of salad with the mushrooms  
the carvery had turkey  stuffing  cabbage   peas   I can safely say I would never eat here again  

took that long I decided to leave dessert  as did not want to wait another 40 mins for this  

I can see now why for such a big place it was empty"
R0018,Excellent food and excellent service
R0018,Absolutely gorgeous dinner in a lovely environment  It was my pre wedding dinner with my bridesmaid  The setting and food really made it special 
R0018,Always amazing food  great ambience and beautiful views
R0018,Always enjoyed this restaurant  Food and staff is great
R0018,"As usual the experience at the this place was lovely  Our server was great with the menu and accommodating for my Dads diet requirements 

The special was much better than expected and getting my Mum to try the pate  which was also delish  was special 

Great place   highly recommend it   

And the view from the front is amazing"
R0018,Booking not honoured  Very disappointed  I know I booked late but the point of this app is that you can do that  The manager was at best dismissive of the issue  Will not be back
R0018,Excellent  GF options and service was friendly  Highly recommend for a pit stop 
R0018,Good but disimproved since last time I was there  Would not be back  Chips thrown on plate and luke warm  Steak tiny 
R0018,Great food and great service in a nice cosy environment  I would 100 percent recommend this restaurant 
R0018,Great location app says no parking but there is street parking no bother  A little bit cramped but worth it to get in and eat the delicious food 
R0018,"Great location  great views accross   Good atmosphere 
Food poor value  starter very tasty but presentation on plate poor   Main course came on cold plate  small portion and bland"
R0018,Great staff and great food  We booked on online app last minute and they accommodated us very well at a very busy time 
R0018,Had to pay for the sauce and the chips 
R0018,I came here at the recommendation of a good friend of mine who was living in the area  And I have to say that the food here is fairly mediocre at best and the woman who rung up me and my husband was quite rude  Maybe it is just this location but  I have to say I was disappointed I would just try a different location 
R0018,Its a shame  but I think this place needs a bit of a re haul to keep up with the big players in town these days 
R0018,Loved it here   best breakfast ever
R0018,Me and my girlfriend went here last night and absolutely enjoyed everything to the fullest  We are from California so we enjoy all types of food  this place ffers excellent food choices and we werent disappointed  
R0018,My partners main was also bland; it was meant to have chilies in it  but again it was not spicy nor hot in any way 
R0018,Nice setting and very good service  Great menu that combines local products and French cuisine  Nice wine selection  Highly recommend 
R0018,Nothing special  Crust very thin but topping sort of slipped off  Next time we are in Dundrum we will go to Counter burger just across the block
R0018,Really enjoyed this gem just minutes from where we stayed in Dublin  Probably the best scones Ive had in and around Ireland  Coffee was fabulous too 
R0018,Staff seemed disorganised when it came to bookings   I was told 3 times they didnt have the booking  and was told the same on the day when I arrived despite getting text and email as a reminder of the booking and a phone call to them to confirm   Otherwise food is very nice and cute place to go for dining
R0018,Staff where helpful  food was less than average 
R0018,Tasty pizza and a nice space  I would definitely recommend  Just be aware that the pizzas are thin crust so youll need more than you expect and theyre a tad pricey 
R0018,Very nice experience as always  Restaurant was busy but we still got that personalised attention we are used to getting while eating  Cant recommend it enough 
R0018,When we arrived and the person who met us as we entered the premises realized we were two adults and two kids we were told the restaurant was fully booked  this was despite the fact that there were quite a number of empty tables   When we mentioned that we had a booking on the app we were told that it was an error that the app was showing free tables   We showed them the app on our phone which was showing free tables for the next few time slots   They again said this was an error and that the restaurant didnt use the service anyway  It seemed like once they realized the booking for four was two adults and two kids rather that four adults they didnt want us and were looking for any excuse 
R0019,"A disappointing 2 stars  I was lured here by a pear scone and I am a sucker for a good pear scone  

The scones arrived and looked small and pityfull accompanied by the smallest portion of jam that I have ever seen which was served in a timble sized paper thingy  Very little pear in the scone which was dense and not very nice 

The scone then lodged in my gut for the next 3 hours  The coffee was very good but failed to wash it down 

Perhaps I picked the wrong thing but with so many places to choose from I doubt I would go back "
R0019,A place to drop in and eat quickly rather than sitting with friends and enjoying good conversation in a pleasant atmosphere 
R0019,Absolutely amazing food  drinks and service  
R0019,Absolutely fantastic for my partners birthday  Amazing food  good atmosphere   
R0019,Always amazing from the food to the staff who go above and beyond for you  My favourite restaurant in Dublin  Outstanding    
R0019,"Always fantastic    Excellent value and friendly staff   
Its the best breakfast in town 
It has a  great choice of lunch and dinners options on menu"
R0019,Awesome food  wine was great too  will definitely be back  thanks 
R0019,"Completely over rated and over priced on the seafood   perhaps thats not the case for steaks and chips n fries 

Waiting period was considerable taking into account the order  but the restaurant was almost full 

Service tax shouldnt apply for 2 people regular meal with the service it was provided  10 percent   Should be up to the customer to decide that  didnt wanted to make a scene but its an unpleasant surprise / "
R0019,"Disappointed sums up our experience   menu should be more accurate   rather than state 2 sides  it should say with chips and coleslaw  no other options available  The steak size were  lets just say questionable      my friend and I had an 18 oz steak with lobster sharing meal  it came out on a plate each  lobster was nice but the steaks we were served were more similar to 4 6 oz each  Not great for the price 

Staff were not very attentive and had to keep chasing for drinks  desert menus and then the bill "
R0019,First time here  his second   we sent the fries back as they were cold when they came out  onion rings also on the cool side but stuck with them  Overall is ok but I like food to come out hot so as this was an issue on our meals Im not sure Id race back  there are a good number of options in the area which Id try first before going back
R0019,"Food was too greasy  Burger was overcooked  
Crab meet toast was tasty as was goat cheese 
Atmosphere was    average   it was basically empty"
R0019,"Managed grab a food menu and ordered club sambo   2 drinks 
Club sambo open with no sides like fries or salad 
Would have paid for some is it was said but again think we just got bad wateress
 Euro 27 for sambo no sides   2 pints em not great at all "
R0019,"Good food quality 
Nice place and kind staff
However the portions might need to be reviewed as too expensive compared to what is offered"
R0019,Good service but steaks not cooked as requested value not aligned with the price  Beer was cold wont return any time soon
R0019,Great food and even better service  would definitely recommend  
R0019,Great food and fantastic service  The Wellington was delicious and the price point was very fair 
R0019,Had this restaurant booked in advance for bottomless brunch for st Patricks day as aware it can be hard to get a table with so many people about  We were so excited to do the bottomless brunch and had heard really good things about beef and lobster  However when we got there we were told that there was no bottomless brunch menu on Saturday and therefore for us it was going to work out a lot more expensive to buy drinks individually  So so disappointing  Food was good but service was terrible  We had to ask 3 times what the vegetarian options were before we finally got an answer  This was for our friends birthday and it definitely dulled the mood as we were really looking forward to it 
R0019,Have been afew times and found this time they went very downhill   the starters were smaller than usual  The mains were burnt  steak and burger  the presentation on the steak was really bad   no garnish or anything to dress the plate  Honestly the food is not worth the money   Euro 100 for 2 starters  2 mains  1 dessert  2 diet cokes and 2 G and Ts  We got the manager about the poor food and in fairness she gave us a free round of drinks and dessert which was nice but honestly didnt do them justice cause I wont be back after that  
R0019,"Have been to this place now a few times and thought I better write a review before it goes under  �Place was empty at lunchtime there yesterday and I wondered why  when there was a queue out the door just around the corner  �When I got my food I think I understood a bit better   now I know some of the differences in trade could be because unless you know this place is there in the vaults  yuo probably wont walk past it and decide to pop in  but I have to say I thought the food on offer was pretty poor  �the  Euro 8 90 ""Powerbowl"" contained a huge amount of salad  probably 70 percent of the bowl  the rest of which was some black rice  which cried out for some seasoning  and two servings of meat  "
R0019,My fiancee had the duck and gagged several times  �We tried to be polite the whole time but it was tough to hide our disappointment  We were sat all the way in the back where it was super hot  and flies buzzing all around us  served by a waiter  Declan  who was nice but ignored us for the majority of the night and even forgot my fiancees wine  
R0019,"Its a tale of two feelings really  Firstly I have to say that  was one of only a dozen places that had a table for 7 available at the end of November  this should have been a hint  I was really happy with the staff who were very friendly and attentive and the restaurant itself is bright  well decorated and buzzy  a nice place to be  The menu is small but good with lots of choices  The starters were ok  the lobster fritters were a lowlight  mushy disappointing blobs with so little lobster one would need a microscope to find it  
The big issue was the mains  Im a hungry guy and decided to have a steak and a lobster  its a good job I did because the steak which came out was disappointingly small and worse  badly cooked  I wouldnt be surprised if they precook all their steaks and reheat once ordered  It had the texture of a recently defrosted piece of meat that had been oven cooked and then seared  Disappointing and without the nice pepper sauce it would have been tough to finish  For a steak at this price I want completely surprised though  The same cant be said for the lobster  I asked for a small one as they charge by the 100g but was told they only had one size  The lobster that came out was priced at  Euro 48 and I may as well have gone to Lidl and bought myself 4  It was small  tasteless and overcooked to the point that the meat stuck inside the claws and wouldnt budge 

I wont be back  its cheap food at high prices and for a place that prides itself on its lobster it needs to seriously up its game "
R0019,Lobster was mushy and the table next to me had the same issue   not sure if its frozen or just poorly prepared but wasnt at all good  Steak was ok but the price of  Euro 32 for surf and turf is overpriced and ridiculous  The manager and staff were very nice and refunded  Euro 7 but frankly I wouldve rather enjoyed my meal 
R0019,Meal spoilt by loud work group that took over half the restaurant  couldnt hear ourselves talk  pity because food and service was good
R0019,"My wife  daughter and son were extremely hungry and just got to our hotel  We looked for a breakfast/brunch place and saw the reviews for this place  I must say we ALL were very disappointed  As with my other reviews  this will be broken down 

1  Service   If I were the owner  I would retrain the employees on how to treat customers  particularly the girl  My wife asked a question about the tomatillo sauce  Is it like a salsa or just sauce  The girl server said it is on the side  �My wife asked again  But is it like a salsa or just a sauce  She replied again  if you dont like it  it is on the side anyway  Three times we did this and her reply was the same   Not what my wife asked  �I had to specify and told my wife it is a sauce  �

Maybe it was something lost in ""accent"" land as we are in Ireland  but she spoke English like we did  

When the food was delivered  they were giving us wrong plates  They gave me my sons  etc     � not a difficult thing to notate who gets what 

Food   Green Eggs  Poached eggs where way over done  and the avocado tasted like it was over ripe  �Very Bland as well 

The Champion Breakfast was ok but the smoked salmon part was a little off 

The little Irish  LMAO  �The Sausage was mushy  How is sausage mushy  The SNOTTY scrambled eggs is pretty much testimony of the rest  OMG the bread was more like a brick of concrete than bread  �

French Toast  �YEAH you cant really mess up French Toast  UNLESS you charge 3 00 Euros for extra Maple Syrup  REALLY    � 

Tea and Coffee  �I am literally dumbfounded  My Americano was Lukewarm at best  and the tea  which was supposed to be an Irish tea  tasted like a typical Orange tea but with a fishy taste 

I am not sure if we hit them on a bad day or what  but this was just plain bad  �Sorry to the owner  I am being honest "
R0019,"Myself and 9 other friends were arranging a get together on St  Patricks day in Dublin so we decided on doing a brunch city centre so upon exstensive research of good brunch spots this seemed to come out on top  we then noticed they did bottomless brunch which was a fantastic addition  I booked the table over 1 month in advance to avoid any disapointment and even went in the Wednesday before our brunch to
Double check our booking and to ensure we could do bottomless brunch  Upon arriving to the restaurant on March 17th we were told that they could not offer us bottomless brunch due to it being St  Patricks Day  We received no email or phone call to inform us of this before arriving to the restaurant and no great effort was made by management to apologize  We were extremely disappointed however I have to commend one of the young waiters with slight facial hair was just so lovely and good humored even though they were very busy "
R0019,Nothing worth to be mentioned to the restaurant  Food there are really poor quality I have to admit 
R0019,Overall the food was just lacking in taste and quality  The wings were very bland  the steak was very fatty and the sides were also not great  The only thing I enjoyed was the wine and cocktails    food was just poor  Would not go back 
R0019,Perfect for brunch  Highly reccomend the buttermilk chicken it ticks every box
R0019,"My starter  a spring roll  arrived  from a waiter who didnt bother to look at me as I said thank you  While it was nice and crispy it was tasteless and oily  
The main  sweet and sour chicken  arrived with the same treatment from the waiter  This was much more pleasant with a good portion size  
The dessert  a fruit salad  was terrible  Soggy bland fruit obviously out of a can with whipped cream also from a package  
Maybe I was simply not ""in the know"" about something as all other reviews I saw gave 5 stars but for me it was a real disappointment "
R0019,Stay away from this place  We told them we want to just have some drinks and they were fine  Until we decided that we dont want to have food they told us that we have to because they dont have a license to just serve alcohol 
R0019,Quiet lovely and charming   and of top all of that simply great food   Will be my choice for Valentines day definitely   
R0019,Restaurant does not care about reservations via this site  Although it was closed for Christmas eve  they did not bother to update the system  thus my reservation was accepted  While they should have seen my reservation  the staff did not bother to call me to update me  When I arrived at the restaurant on time  I found the restaurant closed and I had to scramble to find a replacement as it was a christmas dinner with my family  We ended up with chinese delivery  I wont recommend this restaurant to anyone at all after this incident 
R0019,Service was a bit stiff but atmosphere good and menu / food was excellent  For a special occasion  would recommend 
R0019,"Staff was great  however  with such a small menu  one would think that the kitchen would be able to properly cook the food  We ordered a medium Wellington  which came out at least mid well  We also ordered the whole lobster  which was so overcooked that the lobster meat was mushy  not firm as it should be  Would not recommend visiting this establishment 
The service was great  The staff were friendly and bar service was quick "
R0019,Staff were very friendly  Food very disappointing and not great value for money  I would not return/recommend 
R0019,Terrible experience there  We arrived at 2 30 for our reservation  then to be brought to our seats at 2 40  then another 25 minutes until a menu was given to us  hen another 30 mins before we where told the wrong menu was given to us  by this stage and not even asked if we wanted a drink  Right menu given to us then another 20 min wait before the order was taken  Another 30 mins before our starters came out and they brought me the wrong one  Then  a further 25 mins before my right starter came out  I had lost my appetite by then and just wanted to get out of the place  Poor and the food is overpriced in my opinion for what it is  If you hungry dont go there or you will be left hungry  Find somewhere else to go  I will not be recommended this to friends and i certainly will not be back thats for sure 
R0019,The food was not good   The cut of steak was tough for a filet and the lobster was chewy   We ate less than half and we were starving after a long day of touring   The waiter had a good sense of humor and was pretty attentive   He noticed we barely ate and asked if everything was alright   We said yes because we were not interested in round two   We tipped normally as that is what we do as its not the servers fault when the meal sucks   New rule  steak and lobster is not the same as in the USA   Im not talking Maine either    Dont go  you will be happy that you didnt 
R0019,The food was very good  The reassurant was completly booked  which normally is a good sign  But The music was to loud  what makes that people talk louder  All together is was very noisy diner 
R0019,The location is pretty good  The ambiance was great  The staff seemed unfamiliar with the menu and very unwilling  The menu on the app and the website are completely different than the one in use  The manager although very accommodating didnt seem willing to be helpful to patrons  The food was fair but unexceptional at best  My steak was very dry and cold and very mushy but the shrimps in sauce were very good  I ended up trying the lobster as well and it seemed too cooked at some places and hurried in others  very much flavourless which in fairness could have been out of season  The lemon sauce provided was also very dull and flavourless  I have heard the burger are pretty good though  I would not recommend anything else here 
R0019,The service was excellent and the staff were very friendly and attentive  The food was  delicious  would highly recommend 
R0019,The three course meal is the best  Its amazing food at a super reasonable price  We are so glad to have have found this restaurant   
R0019,This definitely doesnt live up to the dinner  which is very good    this however felt cheap and really the food was not up to scratch  Both my friends eggs were under cooked  raw white   I couldnt have the special starter on the brunch even tho their was items on the brunch that were more expensive  so made no sense  The chorizo start was completely tasteless and to be honest so was the main  Also the drinks kept being filled up way to high in the glass  disaster was bound to happen  and it did  My drink spilled all over the table by the waitress who rather than clean it up continued to fill other tables glasses leaving me to have to ask several times for it to be cleaned up then ask for more napkins then ask for a fresh glass   really the servicewasnt up to scratch at all   but the dinner is very good but Im turned off now so wont be returning
R0019,This was my second  and probably last  visit  The first time  the food was good and the staff busy but efficient and friendly  This time was very different  The restaurant was not busy at all but still the service was slow  The food was just ok  the steak was cooked how I asked but wasnt very tasty and the lobster flesh was rather mushy  I suspect it had been frozen   very disappointing  especially for the price   which carried a service charge  There are much better places to eat in Dublin  I doubt we will go here again 
R0019,"Unfortunately they had no record of our booking with but we were accommodated  Staff had very little English which  who appeared to be  the manager seemed aware of and checked on us a few times 
Very touristy venue  not what we expected from outside "
R0019,Unfortunately  was not impressed with my visit   Food was overpriced and portions were not as expected   Tables were way too close together  Friends of staff came to the bar and were nearly sitting on top of us  Staff were very friendly though 
R0019,"Very disappointing  

Ive heard great reviews about this place  Amazing even  however  my experience was less than even acceptable  

I went on New Years Eve  early  6pm  There was only 4 tables on the ground floor occupied  so the Bar was near empty and no one working there looked busy   to the point it looked like they were just hanging around  

I went with a Vegan  I am not Vegan  We had drinks and they were nice  but nothing out of the ordinary  Just drinks  Then we started to order  
My friend The Vegan we shall call them  told the waiter prior to ordering if there was anything on the menu that he could eat or was there anything there that could be adapted for him to eat  
He was told that there were a lot of the veggie options that he could have  
When the food arrived  there was cheese on everything    EVERYTHING    No exaggeration  There was dairy sauce on everything and to really cause insult  the seasonal vegetables have bacon in there  despite it not being mentioned on the menu   and us being told there would not be served to him  It was awful  When we got the bill  there was seasonal veg on it  So I politely asked if they could remove it and with a surly face the waiter scurried off and asked the hostess  No one was particularly nice or friendly  they made no effort to accomodate my friend and even my own food which wasnt specific was mediocre and very predictable  Even for the Christmas menu  Everthing I ordered was either overdone  and by overdone I mean burnt  or underdne and raw  I ordered chips that i wouldnt serve to my dog  

Goodluck if you do go "
R0019,"Very greasy food  pizzas sweets olive oil  also risotto   

Very good flavour  but after several hours  me and all my family were sick  "
R0019,Very overpriced  Steak is about 24 euro and you dont even get any sides  I asked for a medium steak and it was well done  My boyfriend asked for blue and it was medium  We got two started two mains sides and one drink each and it was 100 euro  Far too expensive for the lack of quality  Full of tourists 
R0019,"Was dying to try this place but have to say wasnt great They had no crab claws so I got ""extra"" prawns and we asked for truffle parmesan chips and got regular and a wrong drink order Overall I was so looking forward to this quirky place but big let down sad to say "
R0019,We had a few issues with wrong food coming  missing orders and starters coming after our main  Very expensive for what it is  and we werent impressed with the food  The half  and  half burger was bland and over cooked and �medium rare steak was more like medium well  Looks like we came on a bad night  from the reviews we were expecting great things  Disappointed 
R0019,"We had a very average meal here for a birthday last week  I had been for lunch about a year ago and thought it was a nice spot  This experience was very poor and the service was quite bad  We asked for bread  a dessert menu  a cocktail menu   all of which were forgotten  the waiter also never told us about any specials  There was no beef and lobster dish on the menu which was a change from when I was there previously  it used to be the speciality  Main course including sides used to be 22 euro  now sides are extra and there is no way you would call it a dish without them  Overall just not up to scratch
given the amount of fantastic restaurants in Dublin now "
R0019,"We visited on a busy Saturday night   Great atmosphere service was excellent and food was lovely 
I would highly recommend"
R0019,"Went with a group over christmas  really disappointed  they try everything to get money out of you  Online menu is a lot cheaper than the Christmas menu  they completely rip you off only giving you the options of the  Euro 25 2 course menu  If you ask for one course they arent impressed and charge you more than the online menu with a flat rate of  Euro 15 per course 

They were also very pushy with the bottomless brunch mimosas "
R0019,Worst fries I have ever had  Burger was subpar and I couldnt finish  We really enjoyed Bunsy and would recommend you forget this place 
R0019,"You will not be disappointed 
Great food service and atmosphere 
We visited twice both times work great"
R0020,As close as it gets to have NY style pizza in Dublin  Def worth trying if youre missing home 
R0020,Best goats cheese salad I have ever eaten  great chicken wings  good wine selection  friendly service
R0020,Great food and service and catered very well for small kids 
R0020,Great place to grab a bite for lunch  before the cinema  if meeting a friend or if heading out afterwards  Nice  casual atmosphere  Great service   fantastic calzones 
R0020,"Shown to table after a short wait
Chosen Pizza was only fair quality base was too heavy ham parts over cooked 
Nobody checked if our meal
Was OK even though it was not busy at that time 
I know only a small thing but knives were blunt 
Wont be back  sorry "
R0021,"A game of two halves 
We arrived and were shown to our table promptly despite it being straight after a rugby international and the restaurant extremely busy  Coats were taken to cloakroom for us and drinks order was taken immediately  The two young ladies looking after us were delightful  Food order completed and starters arrived very quickly  Extremely tasty  Main courses served and a little repartee with the server  All good so far              again  very good flavours  
However  the assistant manager was very courteous removing our empty plates and offered a dessert menu and coffee                                                all of a sudden  Nothing  
20 minutes wait before one of  the young servers took pity on us  Assistant manager arrived ""post haste"" with profuse apologies  Too late  bill paid and left  
Such a pity as we were enjoying the atmosphere and would have stayed on for more fun "
R0021,Absolutely beautiful lunch in Dax yesterday  The lamb was fabulous and the wine sublime  Service was excellent as always
R0021,Absolutely Perfect  Nice Service  Food was Great and with 85 Euro  for 2 People  3 courses  absolutely fair
R0021,Absolutely unreal steaks  some of the best Ive ever experienced complimented with first class service 
R0021,Arrived for a 7:00pm booking and were crammed into the front section with the large windows along with all the other diners  while the main part of the restaurant was unused  maybe they wanted to make it look busy for people coming from the RDS  The place lacked atmosphere  the tables are a funny size making conversation more difficult  Service was ok  Food was passable   might be ok for a quick business lunch  but I dont think Ill be returning 
R0021,"Arrived for our meal to be told we did not have a reservation  ended up having to point our name out in the reservation book to convince the girl we had indeed booked   I ordered a meat feast pizza to be served a four cheese pizza  my wifes broccoli was not anywhere near cooked  so everything was sent back to try again 

Waiting staff were pleasant enough  front of house terrible   Were told at the end of our night that they were busy and these things happen

Just our luck then Im sure it will be somebody else the next week    "
R0021,Ate here 3 years ago and it was fabulous  ate here this weekend and it wasnt as good as I had remembered and it seemed quite pricy for what we ate  Disappointed  
R0021,Bar man  Sean  dressed up as a lobster  quality Guinness  quality service  great banter  What a stag  What a bar  Well be back
R0021,Cracking Bar  Great Service  lovely pint of Guinness and the Beef Guineas stew was awesome  Nice live music great atmosphere 
R0021,Delicious linguine and prawns   nice ambience   wonderful location for a lunch meet up or a cosy date  
R0021,Despite having a confirmed booking via app we arrived to find the restaurant closed 
R0021,Excellent restaurant no hesitation to recommend to anyone
R0021,Food was excellent and staff very helpful  Will be back soon 
R0021,Great food in lovely surroundings  Good choice in early bird menu
R0021,"Great location for the RDS  
Staff excellent  
Food Good   A tad pricey"
R0021,Great place to call in for a business lunch   fast service around lunchtime and very tasty  Would recommend highly
R0021,Great service  and  quality food  If you are looking for a quick lunch you can be in  and  out within an hour 
R0021,"Great service and fabulous food  
We had a great night and will definitely come again "
R0021,Had a group of 8 and really enjoyed our lunch   Great buzz and I will deffo be back  Wld like to try evening menu 
R0021,Havent been here in a while but stopped in for gazpacho and salad yesterday  Delicious and really healthy 
R0021,I knew this under a previous owner this is a great restauarant with good food friendly yet not overbearing staff and a relaxing atmosphere
R0021,It was a rare occasion that myself and my husband got a night out without the children  We enjoyed our night but we felt the service was a little poor  After we ordered it took a long time before our starters arrived  The lady showing people to their tables was very energetic and busy but it didnt help you to relax because she was rushing all over the place  I had to eat my dessert with my coat on because I found it very cold  The lady beside me on another table was also quiet cold and I over heard her asking the waitress to turn up the heating and she also wore her coat for dessert  My husband was treating me to dinner and twice he asked the waitress to take for the meal  He went to the bathroom and while he was gone the waitress came to take the bill and I told her I dont know my husbands credit card number so I had to pay with my own card and he was very disappointed about this 
R0021,Lovely spot  Crispy   thin �based pizza with good quality ingredients  Cute and cool space  but not in a poncy way 
R0021,nice place  small  great staff allways a smile and a little chat while dealing with you fish chowder fab  try to avoid between 1 to 2 alltho they move fast more relaxed at other times
R0021,Not authentic Italian food really mediocre if not bland  Spent  Euro 75 and regret it  Cold and no atmosphere
R0021,One of my favourite cafes in Dublin  Really good cakes and a great all day brunch with pancakes  Good value and a great people watching spot  Grab and outdoor seat and watch the world go by  The apple and blueberry crumble is so good too  Get them to serve it warm with cream and drizzled with raspberry sauce  Enjoy 
R0021,Overall it was a pleasant enough experience  However I dont recommend sitting in the conservatory area as the sound of the chairs being moved about on the tiled floor  mainly by the staff  was grating to the nerves to say the least 
R0021,Really great food  fab atmosphere  Loved it  V v reasonsble  desserts were really tasty too and staff very helpful 
R0021,Service is fantastic  Pizza was very good  Caprese salad and prawn salad were delicious  Small and quaint  Our group loved this place  Our last meal in Dublin was a winner
R0021,Service slow  had to ask for wine a second time  service slow  disappointed as have been to this restaurant before  Not particularly impressed 
R0021,Staff very helpful and friendly   Found food quite bland  wouldnt really rush back
R0021,Superb food  Great cocktails  Very good value for money  Will definitely go back again
R0021,Terrible service  Could not get attention from waiters  By the time we received our drinks our meal was finished  Would nor recommend this restaurant  Had to ask numerous times for things 
R0021,The dishes were top notch  especially the appetizers on the house  Highly recommended for a romantic dinner in two 
R0021,The service was a little slow  the food was quite good
R0021, Clearly they dont have enough staff  and are milking the fact that they are a reliable brand in a busy shopping centre to under staff and up their profits  but all in all I will not recommend
R0021,Was nice  but service was poor   They forgot our sides didnt arrive with our main and arrived when we were nearly finished   When we paid our bill  our change was not returned to the table  we had to ask for it   But food was lovely and I would return 
R0021,We had a late lunch here and everything was delicious  The staff was friendly and helpful  they have a huge selection of draft beers and ciders More
R0021,"we used app to book a table yesterday  The booking was for 12:30 and we got a call from the restaurant a week before we arrived to confirm we were still planning to use the booking and to let us know that they needed the table at 2:30pm for the next guests  which was fine  We arrived on time  were again told by the staff that our table was needed at 2:30pm  We had our main meal  and were waiting for our desert when we were told the table was needed at 2pm  We asked for the manager who told us that a  we were late arriving in that our booking was for 12midday and that we had been told we could just stay 2 hours  which took us to 2pm  I showed him my email confirmations from app that showed we were booked at 2:30pm and then he tried to change his story and said  ""ok but we still told you you had to leave at 2pm   which just wasnt true  No apologies  or understanding  just a very very rude and inappropriate manager  We wont return again  I have just also looked online and whilst there are many good reviews  there are also far too many bad ones and a common theme of the bad ones is the unsympathetic approach of the manager  even when he is clearly in the wrong"
R0022,Best meat since long time and as a plus it a very close to temple bar and alle the other bars   I took a fillet 10 oz moderete well cooked 
R0022,Delicious food  lovely service  great choice for vegans at reasonable prices  Recommend  Ps the scones were UNREAL   
R0022,Friday night dinner out in town spent it here  Well worth the time spent in here
R0022,Great food  good value for money and filling and healthy  but nowhere to sit 
R0022,Overall very good   Friendly   Food was very good   lamb excellent  sirloin a bit tough   Great dessert   Wine options limited   Great atmosphere 
R0022,"The owner and the chef are amazing 
Food and wine were outstanding "
R0022,This one of my best restaurant in Dublin I come here every weekend the food its tasty  nice atmosphere i recommended this place
R0022,This place was so much fun for me  The service was friendly and prompt  the food was gorgeous 
R0022,Very nice food  completely different to anywhere else Ive been 
R0022,What a great new vegan place  Food was delicious though a bit expensive  We had the 6 course tasting menu  Thoroughly recommended 
R0023,First time and would recommend it highly  fantastic food  delicious flavors and very reasonably priced  Look forward to my next visit
R0023,First visit of many I suspect   Food was gorgeous and service was courteous and friendly 
R0023,Great pizza  even if it was a little greasy  �The tiramisu was delicious as well  Definitely recommend stopping in here while in Dublin 
R0023,Nice place  Need a little bit more cleanliness    We had a wonderful dinner and really enjoyed the evening  Thanks
R0024,Prices are perfect based on portion
R0024,"A super Bistro  Great Food  and a good selection of specials from the chef  Service was very friendly  A busy spot and worth returning for the whole package 
Love it"
R0024,I really would have appreciated a tokenistic leaving a coke off the bill or something  I got nothing  but whatever 
R0024,Amazing food at excellent price  Consistently good
R0024,Definitely one of the best Bistros  Food delicious and staff extremely accommodating  I just keep coming back 
R0024,Delicious  good choice on menu  staff pleasant and efficient
R0024,Excellent band on at the weekends   Drinks a little cheaper than other Bar  didnt eat but what we saw come out of the kitchen looked really nice 
R0024,Excellent food and service lovely ambience great value for money
R0024,Fabulous afternoon with a fantastic waiter   It was worth the prices and food was lovely  Will be back 
R0024,"felt like we were on a conveyor belt attitude get us in and out as quickly as possible 

had asked for particular table  which i understand cannot always be delivered on but when i asked i was just brushed off 

i am a reasonably regular customer it will be a while till i come back i think  dissapointed used to be my favourite restaurant "
R0024,Fingerprints and lipstick on a glass of fresh wine  biro marks on menus  room temperature water  bland mussels and presentation of my feather blade beef was different to my friends who got exact same  I have been there before and was impressed so maybe it was just a new chef or because its close to Christmas    Either way I was not impressed and wont be going back 
R0024,Food is middle of the road   nothing exciting   safe
R0024,Food poor quality and overpriced  front of house guy  very false and smug
R0024,Food tasty  but service slow  Had to leave table to ask for salt  another coffee and the bill
R0024,Food was excellent but service was poor  non one asked if food was ok after being served and overall wasnt very friendly plus it took ages to get the bill   It also took a long time for them to take our order   disappointing as food was good but service was terrible  
R0024,Food was fine  service was appalling   took ages for menus  drinks etc  to be delivered to our table  Waitress repeatedly walked off as we were asking questions mid sentence  It wasnt busy  there were two other tables of guests  so there is no excuse 
R0024,Food was good but not great   Wine list was limited  and when we found something interesting  they were out of stock    We were not impressed with the ambiance   After hearing so many good things about this restaurant  we were disappointed 
R0024,"Food was good but the service was poor  Restaurant was busy so not enough staff on  
coeliac options were poor "
R0024,"Food was nice  but no more than similar restaurants  
Service very poor  Borderline rude   Food was thrown on the table  on my wife hand   No apologies  not even an ""enjoy your food"" "
R0024,Great food  great staff  great ambiance  I dont think I need to say anymore 
R0024,Great irish breakfast  Can share between 2 people  Acommodating to vegans  Potato soup was great 
R0024,Great night  Busy Monday  service and food both excellent  Great ambiance and atmosphere  Definitely be back 
R0024,Great really enjoy atmosphere and food  Very good service too  A definite favourite
R0024,Great spot  Excellent food and service
R0024,Had fillet steak  Everything was extremely bland  The steak  chips  pepper sauce  Not worth  Euro 30  The dessert was really good though lemon posset but not enough to make me rush back as main so disappointing
R0024,Had pancakes   They were not nice at all 
R0024,Have dined here several times and was very disapointed this time  Our table was poorly located  We found the menu very limited and whilst the food was nice  it certainly did not justify the cost 
R0024,"I brought my family here for my husbands birthday   Food was beautiful   however it didnt make up for the really poor service  It was like Fawlty Towers  One side plate brought for a table of four  side orders never arrived  no knowledge of what beers they had available  wouldnt bring our bill to the table   asked us to pay on way out  I had also rang in advance to see would they put candles in my husbands dessert   they said they would   but didnt 
Wont be a repeat visit from us "
R0024,I would highly recommending  the food  wine and  staff are amazing  We had a super experience from the time we walked in the door until we left 
R0024,"We were there for Christmas Eve lunch and I felt it was a very different experience 
It was very busy so therefore I felt we were rushed and the food was not as good as our previous visit 
Goats cheese starter lacked dressing  and flavor and nobody came to ask us if it was ok  The  batter was too thick on the fish  I had the fish a couple of weeks ago and the batter was much lighter and nicer "
R0024,Ive been here before but unfortunately this visit was a big let down   The lunch menu on a Saturday was quite disappointing and also over priced  Ive been here for brunch and dinner on other occasions and it was lovely but I wont be coming back for lunch again  Staff are very nice though 
R0024,Love the food here  I get the veggie options and they are super delicious  Could eat this all day long  Soooooo tasty  Best Indian around 
R0024,"Lovely food  very good value for money  
Very decent servings on the neighbourhood menu  
Lovely staff  very attentive but not intrusive 
Will definitely be going back "
R0024,Lovely food  really good value and our waiter was so nice  5 stars 
R0024,"Lovely Sunday evening  Very attentive service and great food  Good substantial wine list also with plenty of options  
Always a favorite "
R0024,"My ceviche tuna was good but served with a weird avocado ice cream  Monk fish was 2 min undercooked and the crumble while tasty looked like a school dinner 

The service from start to finish was a shambles and the crowning glory was wishing the guy a Happy New Year at the same front desk only to be ignored 

I am sorry I left a tip but my tip is to avoid and find yourself a table at somewhere"
R0024,New Years Eve  Very busy  Lovely friendly staff  However very noisy and food just okay but as New Years Eve said nothing  Halibut was way over cooked   Tasteless  Staff made up somewhat by friendliness
R0024,Poor response when I send my soup back   it was tepid   Main meal was swimming in far too much sauce  Took ages to get the bill  Has deteriorated since my last visit  Staff hassled and disinterested  pity
R0024,Poor stodgy food  Service slow  Less is more   every dish seems to have at least 3 or 4 superfluous ingredients  Packet sliced ham in salad 
R0024,"Sat beside the kitchen  was like being beside hells kitchen  The noise from chef shouting and banging plates was unreal 
It was 7pm  I had left my kids at home  the waiting staff ignored the two young kids beside us repeatedly stand on chairs and bang their cutlery on the table  
The lentil Dahl was luke warm  The gluten free bread option was the cheap shop bought freezer bread 
Soooooohhhhh disappointing 
Was lovely last time we were there  Never again Im afraid "
R0024,"Service a bit stressed on Fathers Day  Sitting right by kitchen  way too warm 
Extremely overpriced for the food  fillet was dry and over cooked "
R0024,Squashed low table for dining at ala carte prices   Understaffed and had to specifically request glasses of water when we were on mains   None offered before then  Mains were delivered almost an hour after starter  Nice staff though 
R0024,"Starter could have been warmer
Sea bass fillet far to many  almonds  Salad large plate leaves 1 piece tomatoe  dressing   basic   Home made chips ok 
Beef in bowl far to much gravy  sauce 
Mashed potatoes not hot enough 
Over all poor value for money "
R0024,Such a disappointing brunch; avocado toast with poached eggs   Portion size was so small and the avocado was non existent   Considering brunch options around  I wouldnt return   Have had dinner and lunch before though and the service/food has always been excellent with atmosphere second to none but need to seriously up the game on brunch 
R0024,The food was average  The delivery service is very bad  The delivery man shouted at me over the phone when he could not get my address right and was unable to find it on the first attempt  In my opinion  it was very rude to blame and make mean comments to the customers; we are not obligated to buy from them 
R0024,This visit was not up to the usual high standard of customer care I usually associate with this place  Hopefully a once off poor night 
R0024,"This was the last decent looking restaurant on the walk back to our hotel and  though screaming ""touristy""  we decided to give it a shot  �The food looked good  if overpriced  but that was to be expected  �The wait staff seemed pleasant until we placed our order  but thats when things took a turn for the worse 

We had to ask five servers for more tartar sauce before we got any  �Then  not only did they have the stones to try to charge us for it  which would have been fine if it hadnt taken 5 attempts and 10 minutes to get   but they charged us for twice as much as they gave us and acted like we were thieves when we tried to correct the mistake  �The waiter slammed down the ticket and then refused to be flagged down to take the payment so I had to pay at the bar 

With service like that  its clear that this place relies on one time tourist customers  not repeat business "
R0024,Unfortunate review  Booked a table for Sunday at 11 30am for four   Arrived on time for brunch for a family meal  Was told we had to vacate table by 12 30 upon arrival which we were OK with but it wasnt ideal  Service was extremely slow throughout and we kind of rushed our food and drinks to order a coffee for 12 15  No service was offered between 12 00 and 12 30  Had to order a takeaway coffee in the end  Food was nice  Cocktail was average in comparisons to some places  Kids enjoyed their food  Shame that they fell down on service  I love supporting local but wont be returning   
R0024,Very courteous service  helpful to our wheelchair diner    Pleasant and efficient staff  excellent food 
R0024,WE  FOUND THE  MENU  LIMITED     I HAD  THE PATE    WHICH  I FOUND BLAND AND THE  TOAST  WAS  LIMP
R0024,We booked a table for five for a special occasion my mothers eightieth Birthday  We were given two small round tables pushed together with my daughter sitting at the top  It was a disaster 
R0024,"We enjoyed a lot the experience  The ambience couldnt be better  the food is really tasty and the service was perfect  
We will come back again "
R0024,We enjoyed our meal   food was good but not anything special  The difficulty we encountered was the way we were treated on arrival  We had a table booked and were treated as if we were walk ins without a reservation  Two parties   one the same size as ours  were seated before us without explanation  They had arrived sometime after us  We have been to eat there on many occasions in the past and were more than surprised by the lack of communication and the rude way we were treated  When we were eventually seated a lovely  server  was cleaning up the floor  There was  glass and water all  around the table we were shown to   The guy who is front of house had broken a vase and left her to clean up  We have never encountered him before and would be glad never to meet him again 
R0024,We visit regularly for Sunday lunch  The food and service is always excellent and the set menu offers great value 
R0024,"We were generally disappointed   The food servings were very small  we were there for Sunday brunch   and we were asked to leave because our time was up   we were told there was another reservation for our table    The food was fine  the little we received  

Ive been to this restaurant many times previously  and it was excellent 
However  I would not recommend it now "
R0024,We were sitting at a table right beside the open kitchen  It was extremely noisy  and  very hot  The music was also too loud  It was very difficult to have a conversation  The table beside us was far too close  and  the people were able to listen to our conversation so no privacy  The food was nice though 
R0024,We were unable to order the from the Neighbourhood menu since 2 of the party arrived 10 mins late  even though other tables were allowed to order from it  The waiting staff were very pushy and kept checking that our food was finished in order to clear the table  I appreciate that there is a 2 hr limit per table  however the level of service should be accommodate the timeframe for 3 courses and not be overly pushy that the table end up leaving their meal early   Overall  I dont believe that we had a great experience having spent over  Euro 250 for 3 people for dinner and wine 
R0024,"Went with friends and had a blast  the food was top notch and the service matched it at every turn     
Very chilled atmosphere and helpful staff"
R0024,Wow this was perfect on a chilly late summer day  Got some veggie soups and sat outside and took our time
R0025,Bbq restaurant so 4 of us came for ribs to try a new place to eat and they had none left  substituted it with a sausage plate and they were basically two big hot dogs on a plate
R0025,Food was great  Great service ans friendly staff my son is 9 and its his favourite place for food 
R0025,Great evening  Lovely food  and nice pints  Staff are very friendly  Great place to catch up with friends  Music is good too 
R0025,"My friend and I decided to drop in for a 10 am brunch  We ordered the eggs benedict and it was quite possibly the worst version of that meal that Ive ever had  

The eggs were poached but were cooked so thoroughly that the yolk had become hardened  The hollandaise sauce had absolutely no taste and more than 90 percent of it had dripped onto the plate  The eggs were placed on a slice of toast that tasted like American wonder bread  The ham was the kind of thin sliced  square deli ham that you buy in packs from SuperValu for 2 euros each  The spinach was covered in grease  There was absolutely no flavor  

Im a college student and Im definitely not picky about my food  But this meal was so gross that I couldnt even eat it  even with my low standards for food and all  Maybe this place is only really known for its lunches and dinners  I dont know  I usually dont even write Yelp reviews  but having brunch here really inspired me to share my experience   "
R0025,Pretty much half of the menu was not available  Though offered alternatives we did not get them as described  Bummer  Service was nice  food ok but nothing specisl  Prices fair though 
R0025,Service is horrendous and the food was not very good  Went ahead of a show at the theater next door  took 20 minutes for a server to come over and take order  food arrived quickly but was not good  After waiting even longer for my server to come back I ordered dessert  but shouldnt have bothered  After 40 minutes of no dessert and no sign of my server  I went to the bar and paid and left  Throughout the entire experience  there were maybe three parties in the entire restaurant 
R0025,The food was great  servers were lovely and served us in good time  I found it a bit pricey though 
R0025,"I came back for a late lunch  around 2   and while it was busy  the day crew wasnt any better  There was a party ahead of me  so when the waiter asked them how many and told them there would be a wait  he didnt even acknowledge me  I should have left    but because of the good reviews  I stayed  Tables sat waiting to be cleared  I was finally seated  After waiting to place my order  I asked for water as my beverage  The food came  no water  I asked a second time  The mushy peas were lukewarm  The fish was hot  fresh  and delicious  but the chips were not  Even when I was done eating  I couldnt get the waitresses attention to pay  the restaurant had cleared by then   I literally had to get up and walk to the register before she noticed  

Dont waste your time "
R0025,Too expensive for what you get
R0025,was recommended to me by a friend  I decided to bring the family along and the food was shockingly poor  The half chicken was dry and hard to eat  the brisket looked like two slices of roast beef and the ribs came from a very hungry animal as there was nothing of substance on the bones  Some menu items were unavailable and the only saving grace was the waitress  she was very pleasant and helpful  If you like BBQ food and good value for excellent tasting food stay away from and pop across 
R0025,We ate here on a Sunday and were immediately let down as it was quiet so ribs and chicken werent available   Undeterred we ordered brisket  pulled pork   and  beef sausage   I did ask  as it was Sunday  if the brisket was fresh today and was told it was   I did find it a bit dry   There were some nice pieces in there  but about half of the brisket was dry and not great   Their traditional house bbq sauce was great and helped with the dry brisket   The pulled pork was great  how could you go wrong   and went great with their mustard bbq sauce   The beef sausage was okay but I would have much preferred ribs   As for the sides we over ordered as we didnt know that 1 order of cornbread would feed 4   It was delicious but oily so you wouldnt want a lot   The onion rings were bland and not good   The beans  which we were told were spicy  were just ordinary   The garlic potatoes were nice   The hot wings were well prepared but just standard pub grub  not bbqed   The bill was nearly 100 quid  we were stuffed and satisfied  but at this price well try somewhere else next time were hankering for bbq 
R0025,Went there with 5 other people as we couldnt find a table elsewhere  Very disappointed   for the first time in a while nothing was appealing on the menu  The quantity was there but certainly not the quality  Very basic and not so tasty  However very nice staff 
R0026,A filter coffee + salted caramel brownie after a long day of walking in Dublin was just what I needed
R0026,A friend recommended we try the Irish Stew here and we were not disappointed     Highly recommend it 
R0026,Amazing pizza  good price  highly recommend the honey pizza
R0026,Avoiding the mayhem as this place is unreal so I can imagine that it gets packed out but wow   As a veggie the food is on another level oozing with flavour    Great staff
R0026,Best italian pizza in Dublinp
R0026,Best pizza  good drinks selection  child friendly  lovely space  really nice staff 
R0026,Delicious Vegan pizza and very good value for money
R0026,Friendly staff  delicious pizza and great beers on tap  Excellent value too and lovely ambiance 
R0026,Great food and lovely staff  So reasonable too  Have recommended a lot 
R0026,Great pizza  friendly staff and interesting venue makes this a special place to eat 
R0026,I am Italian and I love your pizza  Very good quality dough and ingredients and the staff is always nice  Always a pleasure 
R0026,I loved this place  Amazing food and drinks  Service was kind  friendly and fast 
R0026,I regularly visit this wonderful restaurant and it never disappoints The dolma starter ie stuffed vine leaves is such a delightful starter and the vegetarian moussaka is full of flavour and nutrition There are dishes here for all tastes including prawn dishes and their lamb is of excellent 
R0026,Love this place as me and my partner go once a week food is fab and staff are just so nice   never have any complaints
R0026,meal for 2 with wine  Smaller portions and food more fine dining than mid range  Food enjoyable and would try it again
R0026,My favourite place for date night    never disappoints   The Key Lime Mess is outstanding 
R0026,Overall very good service and tasty food  Standout are the cocktails  Id recommend anyone to try this place   locals and tourists
R0026,Pizza and beer amazing 
R0026,Really great pizza  Excellent beer selection  Nice vibe and child friendly  Perfect neighbourhood pizza place 
R0026,Ronan is phenomenal  and  we thrived here   great whiskey  and  even better company   thanks for a great night
R0026,The food presentation is beautiful  served on marble slabs and in delicate ceramics  with a Japanese influenced simplicity  I thought the restaurant was Japanese from the menu
R0026,The pizzas were brilliant and the staff very friendly
R0026,The prices are a littel bit expensive but justified the good food and beautifull space 
R0026,The queue here is always miles out the door at lunch time and its obvious why   I always go for the Vietnamese chicken  salad leaves  sweet potato and nutty sprinkle  There isnt really much choice in creating your own  like Chopped or Borlottie  but I still love it and highly recommend for fresh salad lovers  Pick up a loyalty card  
R0026,They do a Thai green curry   Amazing  
R0026,This restaurant is as good an example of superb real French cooking as you can get in Dublin and is consistently top class
R0026,"This was a good find  �Good music and good food and didnt break the bank  �Great value 
The short ribs was great "
R0026,We love this place   Local  great pizza and drink selection  The kids love it too 
R0026,Went here with two of my friends and we shared the bruschetta  meatballs and gnocchi  The bruschetta and the meatballs were average  The gnocchi was delicious  �A nice  spot in Dublin 
R0027,Fantastic restaurant  loads of choice and are coeliac friendly 
R0027,Highly recommend this fabulous restaurant  The decor  ambience and  food were amazing  Our waiter Raphael was so helpful  friendly and a pleasure to order from  He is definitely a jewel in this restaurants crown  Really looking forward to returning soon 
R0027,My business group enjoyed it so much they made me book immediatley for the next one  
R0027,21st for my daughter  Could not have been treated better  Fabulous food  Waiter was fantastic and very attentive even though it was extremely busy  Highly recommend
R0027,3 course meal and we were rushed out in an hour  I also made a special request for a birthday desert that was completely ignored  Food was so so 
R0027,A catch up and friends birthday  Great food and great night  Thanks
R0027,"A mediocre experience  I was here many many years ago and booked it as it was central to where we all worked  3 of us had a crab and avocado starter and it wasnt overly nice  The avocado was a thick layer on top and was very overpowering  it wasnt nice  we said the same to the waitress who didnt look as if she cared  The main course for 3 of us was nice to an extent  it was rotisserie chicken  big portion  The other party in our group got crap claws and prawns and was very disappointed  Mentioned the same to the waiter who didnt hear and moved on  Desert was nice all round  I had the tiramusu  great 

Overall  average  busy atmosphere although didnt seem to busy  Wont be coming back any time soon  Theres other restaurants with better quality of food and service for better value "
R0027,absolutely amazing all round  great service food and atmosphere
R0027,Absolutely amazing start to finish  
R0027,Absolutely Super start to finish 
R0027,After choosing this restaurant for the dedicated vegetarian menu  it was such a disappointment that our meal was so poor  The goats cheese tartlet had nice flavours but the pastry was dry and hard  The aubergine and brie fritter was greasy  heavy and just awful  I cant fault the staff who were friendly throughout and said they appreciated our feedback  They consulted the chef and our mains were deducted from the bill  Nice Portuguese wine though 
R0027,"Although there was nothing wrong with the food or service  I found it to be ""ok""  It was above average but the prices do not reflect the quality of food  Either drop the prices or up their game with quality of food  Overall  I wouldnt be rushing back "
R0027,Always fab  Service always outstanding  friendly and warm  Had to wait for one of our party  no problem to wait before ordering main  Food excellent as always  3 steaks and the beef short rib  Highly recommend
R0027,Amazing food and amazing service  Really enjoyed eating there
R0027,Amazing food and great service  Very happy all round
R0027,Amazing food wine cocktails great atmosphere excellent friendly staff well worth a visit
R0027,amazing service  delicious food and even better cocktails  highly recommend 
R0027,An excellent venue for a meal  You are guaranteed a good meal on every visit 
R0027,Anazing food and wonderful staff  Will be coming back 
R0027,Arrived and took about 5 mins for us to be seated despite having a booking   and also despite numerous waiters walking right back me and ignoring me when I told them I had a reservation  Sat down at a very intimate table   if by intimate u mean sitting beside 2 other couples with an inch between the tables   The door of the restaurant was open and was blowing a cold breeze throughout the restaurant and myself and my partner couldnt even take our jackets off we were so cold so we asked to be moved tables  Everything was going fine until the hen party beside us was being extremely loud and then to top things off my wine glass was covered in lipstick and the waiter was so rude about it  I wont be visiting again despite the good reviews I heard previously  
R0027,As always the service and the food was great it it a restaurant I will continue to return to
R0027,Ate here with 2 friends  one of whom is a vegetarian and I chose the restaurant as it seemed like they had good veg options  We each had a starter   Mediterranean plate  mushroom soup  and ahi tuna and they were delicious  But when the mains came  2 monkfish and 1 spinach tortellini   this place really disappointed  The tortellini was average and the monkfish was poor   dry  overcooked  flavorless  Seemed like it had previously been cooked and then reheated before serving  At 27 Euro  I expect much better  We were celebrating a special occasion so I didnt want to bring the evening down and send it back but normally I would have  The service was also scattered  I dont mind when you have multiple servers  as they do  but we just felt a bit forgotten as no one person seemed assigned to our table 
R0027,Awesome staff and delicious ginger licking food      
R0027,Awful service  Average food   Nice decor and menu  Wouldnt go back  Good coctail
R0027,Rudeness ruined the overall experience
R0027,Based on 1 staff member whose rudeness ruined the overall experience  Avoid
R0027,Basic food  poor service and no athmosphere  A real disappointment
R0027,Basic food  poor service and no athmosphere  A real disappointment  especially when we were entertaining USA guests  Shame
R0027,Beautiful food in a central location with great service 
R0027,Beautiful food  service was very good and the bottomless Mimosas were fab 
R0027,Beautiful restaurant  staff  decor  food options everything was amazing  gluten free options were amazing    Highly recommend  Cant wait for next time 
R0027,"Beautiful venue  Terrible service  I went with a group of 6 for a special occasion in December  �It is a gorgeous restaurant and it was bustling with people and atmopshere  However it was probably the worst service that I ever received in a restaurant  The server was clearly disinterested being there  �Server was slow to take order of prosecco to start  He then took our food order  He �was slow to come back to check on us or to take our wine order  We had to chase him down to order the wine after the meal came  �The food was nice but would have been nicer if we had glass of wine to accompany  Server came back to take our dessert  When we asked him what the chocolate special was like e g  cake   mousse etc  He simply said that they had introduced new menu and he did hadnt been in since to see it  There was no offer of finding out which we requested him to do  �We had to ask a couple of times for our check  
from hostess and different �server before it finally came  � Might be a nice place for drinks but I wouldnt rush back for meal "
R0027,Been many times and each time is just great  Keep up the good work guys 
R0027,Birthday evening and was flawless from start to finish  Staff very attentive and you were never left waiting too long  Food was exceptional and good value for what we had  Would highly recommend coming here 
R0027,"Booked a table for 3 for brunch on Sunday   Selection on the menu was fairly good   Selected eggs Benedict  at  Euro 12 95    Food arrived super fast and compromised of Muffin  ham   looked and tasted like packet ham   over cooked streaky bacon  
We were ordering cocktails and the waitress advised us of the special offer for  Euro 15 00 so we all decided to go for that   
We were given a table just in from the door  not really a good place and generally there was little or no atmosphere there at all 
Staff were friendly but very difficult to get their attention  
Decided to order desert as lunches werent very big   I chose the special which was waffles   Would have like to have been told that it was  Euro 12 95 prior to ordering as it was only half eaten   Portion too big and waffles a bit dry and hard 
Overall a disappointing meal with all of us agreeing not to return again "
R0027,"Booked for me and my wife for my wifes birthday  Waited 10 mins at reception before we were approached  Then a further 5 mins to be seated  Myself and my wife were seated at a table very close to other couples on both sides  It was not remotely private  Waited 40 mins between starter and main  I had ribeye steak and ordered it medium but it was more like well done  I ate it anyway because we had waited so long  The food tasted nice but portions were very small and the steak was nothing special  definitely not worth its price tag  
After dinner we ordered cocktails but these never arrived and had to order again from another waitress  
Overall it felt like we would have had a better experience elsewhere "
R0027,Booked two weeks in advance but still got an awful table right beside the bar  It was far too loud and you couldnt hear yourself think let alone have a conversation with the person next to you  My table had 5 people and no one was happy with both starter and main  Everyone had a complaint about the food  There was a strange combination of flavour and spices that didnt work and just ruined the dishes  The only thing I cant complain about was the service which was great  We stopped off at a take away on the way home because we were all still hungry  I will never return to this restaurant and would not recommend it 
R0027,Not usually picky or expected to be waited on hand and foot  but for what looks to be a nicer  upscale restaurant  it had the service of a fast food restaurant or diner  Hope others had much better experiences 
R0027,Brunch was great  service was terrible and the restaurant was not very busy  Sunday after Paddys day 11:30am   Had to ask for tap water after every other table but ours had some  Food was delivered without common condiments  like ketchup  vinegar  mayo  syrup  etc   and our waitress did not check on us after the food was delivered to see if orders were correct or satisfying  Asked for the bill  and waited a good 20ish minutes before it was brought to us and waited an additional few minutes for the card reader  Plates were not cleared before the bill was brought to us  Not usually picky or expected to be waited on hand and foot  but for what looks to be a nicer  upscale restaurant  it had the service of a fast food restaurant or diner  Hope others had much better experiences 
R0027,"brunch was not nice  maybe the kitchen was having a bad day  but all we ordered was no good
starter hummus tabuleh  not good  looked and tasted like the kind of thing you can get at Tescos  
The organic salad is really just a regular salad  nothing special to it  for 12 5 Eur
the sirloin steak was OK  not cooked medium as asked  looked more like well done  
Dessert of peanut butter mousse looked like something you can get at Tesco or Spar   not good for 7 5 "
R0027,"Burger was extremely Salty   
Now I mean tub of saxa salt must of
Fallen into meat mix
I brought this to the waiters attention and that was it   never 
Heard from anyone after that   "
R0027,Buzzy but style over substance  If you are a foody then avoid  If you are a hen night then youll love it 
R0027,The chicken accompanied by a �rich gravy was a flavourless hank of meat in brown water   Euro 44 per person for a meal like that was an insult  Would never go again 
R0027,Came here for Valentines Day and only the set menu was on offer which cost  Euro 44 each  Incredibly limited choice  The dinner was abysmal  My boyfriend ordered a steak medium rare and it came out so well done he could barely cut through  The chicken accompanied by a �rich gravy was a flavourless hank of meat in brown water   Euro 44 per person for a meal like that was an insult Would never go again 
R0027,Came here on two other occasions and was impressed  However  this visit flattered to deceive  The fillet steak I ordered was fatty  which was a disappointment  The sides were also disappointing  Glass of wine was expensive at nice euro  Unfortunately  dont think Ill be back 
R0027,"Came in for a Birthday dinner with my wife as mentioned on the booking reservation  On arrival The male assistant wasnt very welcome our visit basically he wanted to sit us as quick as possible  I mentioned that we have table booked for 19 30pm he replied no worries about it just take a seat  and that was it    
Had a great time and fabulous dinner 
Very Poor service this evening  disappointed "
R0027,Cant fault the food  delicious and well presented  Great for celiacs  Cocktails were spot on 
R0027,Cant fault the food or the service  Fantastic night 
R0027,Cant see myself recommending the restaurant  Too noisy and too cramped  the staff rushed us through our meal taking food and drinks from the table when we were not finished  I lost count how many time I was pushed in the back or a ladies bag hit my back as my seating did not allow enough to pass
R0027,Chicken in Salad was very dry and steak was small  Not good value for  Euro 41
R0027,Completely overpriced tables on top of each  other so you feel squashed and cannot have a private conversation  drinks are so expensive and your glass of wine is not a glass   its filled one fifth of the way up  My BBQ chicken was so dry  my husbands cod was like rubber  Worst of all the waitress made it so obvious she wanted the table back asap   which was annoying because the meal was so expensive we would not go back  not worth the money 
R0027,Worst of all the waitress made it so obvious she wanted the table back asap   which was annoying because the meal was so expensive we would not go back  not worth the money

R0027,Despite booking on 9th January for a table on 10th February  the restaurant called one week before to tell be my table booking would need to move due to a booking of 50 people  They said my booking should never have been accepted due to a computer glitch  I was offered 2 different times but not close to my booking time and not convenient
R0027,Despite booking on 9th January for a table on 10th February I was offered 2 different times but not close to my booking time and not convenient
R0027,Disappointed by the food  Had been looking forward to this meal as it was for my boyfriends 30th  But it was a complete let down  The staff were lovely unfortunately the food wasnt  Far too expensive for the food on offer 
R0027,Dismal service  the weekend lunch is okay and the price is fair  The fried calamari are not so good   
R0027,Drinks really nice  service needs improvement 
R0027,"Dublin is full of great restaurants and cocktail places

Had the burger  and the bun was burned black and compleatly took away all flavor of the drycooked burger inside and the fillings  the chips was very good how ever 

Ordered a Old fashioned cocktail  and it seemed like they forgot to use bitter and sugar  but this allowed me to try whiskey with a orange peel  and cocktail cherrys  horrible  "
R0027,Each time Ive been now the servers have been amazing  So friendly and helpful  The food is always delicious and great deals  We had the  Euro 50 for a 3 course meal and a bottle of wine  Would highly recommend  We will be back
R0027,Everything from the food to the service was great  We were there for brunch and the waitress serving us was great  Well definitely be back

R0027,"Extremely disappointed with our experience    
Would never go again and would tell friends to avoid it "
R0027,"Extremely disappointed with our experience    a friend over from UK   comes twice a year and we always pick a restaurant where we can enjoy good food with a bottle of wine  The menu was limited and the food was awful  all 3 of us left a large amount of food on our plate  no comment was made as to why     if everything was ok etc  I also found it to be very expensive for what we got 

Would never go again and would tell friends to avoid it "
R0027,Extremely friendly staff  we were really well looked after  food was absolutely delicious and I would highly recommend 
R0027,"Fabulous food  friendly  flexible staff   
Fun place "

R0027,Fantastic restaurant  amazing food including catering for my friend who is a coeliac  really lovely  helpful and friendly staff  I was there for my 40th birthday meal and when my friend asked for candles in my dessert as a surprise it was no problem at all  Three members of staff came over with the dessert and sang happy birthday along with my family and friends  Highly recommend this restaurant 
R0027,Fantastic service so friendly and helpful  Food was very tasty and great value 
R0027,Faultless meal  really friendly stafff  great food and great cocktails
R0027,First class dining experience   Good value set menu and staff very friendly and helpful
R0027,First time at this restaurant and would definitely have a returning visit 10/10 
R0027,Firstly I must say that the service was good   and a lovely afternoon was had  However  when I paid bill I asked the waiter if he could add the tip on via my credit card  as service was good  I left a large tip  On rechecking the bill when I got home I noticed that service was already added to the bill  I guess as we were a group of 8   I fully acknowledge it was my fault and I should have checked more carefully but the restaurant was looking for table back and in rush to pay bill I didnt notice service already included  I really believe the waiter should have indicated that service was included  I would have added a further amount to my cc anyway as we were well looked after but I would not have put the amount on that I did  Very disappointed with this and it left a sour taste in my mouth following what was a good afternoon/evening 
R0027,Food amazing  staff very friendly and great service with a smile 
R0027,Food and live music was great  but the service was the worst I have ever experienced  Rude staff ignored members of our group waiting at the entrance to be seated for 10 minutes  they eventually just sat themselves   this was at 12pm on a Sunday and the restaurant was empty  the staff were not busy   We had to get up to ask for service every time we needed anything as not 1 member of staff would make eye contact with us  No staff members were smiling when we spoke to them and they couldnt understand most things that we were asking  The staff were incredibly unhelpful and had an air of arrogance which ruined our birthday brunch  I will not be going back event though the food was great 
R0027,Food looked nice but was lacking in seasoning and was missing sauces that brought the various elements on the plate together  Expensive for what it was  I wouldnt come here again 
R0027,Food portions too big  poor quality for the money spent  Restaurant is loud and difficult to walk through due to table arrangements  Wait staff below average 
R0027,Food quality not good for price 
R0027,Food quality not good for price  Need to improve 
R0027,Food very poor 9 Euro for nachos with no chilli   
R0027,Food was absolutely gorgeous and staff very friendly 
R0027,Food was awful   Stale bread   Crab and avocado starter  Euro 11  straight from fridge so was too cold to taste   Rib  1  was stewed not BBQ    Sweetcorn was frozen in the middle and sweet potatoe fries were mostly burned   My partners meal was half a roast chicken sitting on a bed of peas with mash   No finesse   Could have done that myself   Situation was handled well by waitress and manager   We were not charged for the bbq rib   P S  very little choice of lower price wine   We had a Montepulchiano for  Euro 42 which was lovely but much more than we would spend on our wine 
R0027,Food was bland and uninspiring   Service was ok   Given the price  quite disappointing 
R0027,Food was expensive      I could cope with that if it tasted nice but it didnt  My starter of goats cheese was tasteless   I couldnt eat some of my main due to the strange tasting potato wedges  Only 1 from a party of 4 actually liked their food  The service was good though and our waitress was lovely 
R0027,Food was fab as always  Service amazing   Love love love this place    
R0027,"Food was great  We split the skewers for two  After asking the waitress what kind of skewers came with the NRA she said prawn  lamb  and chicken  This was important as I am a Pesco vegetarian  The food came out with calamari a  lamb  and chicken  We asked he waitress what it was and she responded to us like we were stupid and said calamari  We told her she said it came with shrimp skewers  but she denied that she ever told us that 

So  overall  good food  poor service "
R0027,Food was lovey as always  Service was poor at best  Very disappointed 
R0027,Food was nice but not great Its quiet expensive for the standard We werent offered the early bird menu and we were there in time for it We were a long time waiting on drinks Toilets were messy Not somewhere Ill be returning to
R0027,Food was nice  But took over 40 minutes to recieve our drinks  they came just before our mains were served 
R0027,food was not to the quality we expected  the steak was cold  we asked to reheat   service was not available when we needed it etc
R0027,Food was terrible  you were able to notice that fish wasnt fresh   
R0027,Our group didnt eat all food and waitress didnt even ask was food tasty or something  Bad experience
R0027,"Food was very good  However  service was lacking  The server never took our coats but took the coats of everyone around us  They also forgot our order and had to come back and take it again 
I know it was around Christmas we had our meal so they were obviously trying to fit in as many people as possible but we were far far too close to the people on either side of us  we were almost sitting at their tables "
R0027,"For the prices   this should be so much better  Food was average to poor and the service was  at best  distracted   We had 3 courses from the main menu  The slices of smoked salmon in the starter were thin enough to see through   The medium rare tuna main course was more on the well done side   which turned out to be a good thing as it wasnt the freshest  We had imagined the duck fat potatoes would be super crispy but they were just soggy and fatty  It didnt get any better by dessert  at which stage I sent back my panna cotta as it was simply was not nice   I was told ""thats the way we make it here""   As the customer  this didnt make me feel great  A more senior person came over and tried to explain why I might not have liked the dessert   That was quite rude  and odd  Id ordered it as its a favourite of mine  He eventually deducted it from the bill   They dont appear to have much of a customer service ethos  but I guess they dont need it with the volume of diners  This is an overcrowded  noisy restaurant with tables crammed on top of each other  This was our first visit and it will be our last  There are much better restaurants in Dublin "
R0027,I wouldnt waste my money here when there are so many places that do attentive customer service in Dublin 
R0027,From arrival attention to detail for service is missing  For ourselves and tables near to us  Having to ask for menu other than just wine  No check backs during meal and waiting 20 min for plates to be cleared  We didnt have the same waiter/waitress twice  No one checked whether we would like more drinks  Had to walk to main desk to ask for bill after waiting another 20 minutes for dessert plates to be cleared  When said feeling lonely and not feeling the love this was laughter off by head person  Only when asked about waiter taking payment when I raised how shocking an experience this has been did the main person acknowledge our concern which to add insult he said well we served everyone else well  So shocked and disgusted by comments we refused the offer of staying for a complementary drink  From main guy to our supposed waiter for our section who was more interested in serving his friends a hard look at customer service and recovery of service is needed 
R0027,Fully wheelchair accessible with a good sized disabled toilet  Lovely food and friendly staff 
R0027,General manager was shockingly rude  will never go back
R0027,Good amount of food  quick service and really delicious 
R0027,Good buzz in the restaurant  Service was excellent  but a little over priced 
R0027,Good food good atmosphere but all ruined by  the terrible service   Spent the night having to continuously get up from the table and look for a staff member
R0027,Good food/wine but seating cramped very uncomfortable   conversation impossible
R0027,Good here is not as good as it used to be  Service was excellent and ambience good
R0027,Good meal   but not the deal we booked  Was supposed to be 58E with bottle wine  We paid 93E no wine
R0027,Good pub food but at Restaurant prices  Not for me  The bread was fab 
R0027,"Good quality and good price as well 
We went on sunday and there was a live music "
R0027,Gorgeous food lots of vegetarian options  lovely staff and voucher deal was great value
R0027,Granted this place felt like a last resort and we were apprehensive to eat here to begin with  The atmosphere is clean and minimal with Italian flare and the menu has a variety of options  The waitress however had so much attitude and found it difficult answering questions without rolling her eyes  Youre better off ordering to go 
R0027,"Great atmosphere cracking food brilliant service  can be pricy though but they do have a budget menu too 

highly recommend "
R0027,Great breakfast  Very speedy service  Very tasty food and hot  Super friendly and attentive staff  Highly recommended 
R0027,Great evening  Food was excellent  Service was superb  all very friendly 
R0027,Great food and atmosphere  Had a really fun waitor  Great for a girls night out 
R0027,Great food and excellent service   would definitely recommend to a friend 
R0027,Great food and service  Peanut butter mousse was delicious   
R0027,Great food  excellent service and most of all great wine 
R0027,Great food  great cocktails  good beer  and  friendly staff 
R0027,Great food  Poor service  Staff were reluctant to accommodate our request to be seated away from live music so that we could hear each other  Staff did not know the menu and were unable to answer queries  Everyone enjoyed the food 
R0027,Great food  outstanding service  amazing value for money  used this voucher plenty of times and will definitely buy it again
R0027,Great food  staff and ambiance  Will definitely go back 
R0027,Great food  Creative menu and good service

R0027,Great restaurant  lovely food and really friendly service  
R0027,Great service and great food 
R0027,Great service  great atmosphere  A tad on the expensive side but food excellent  
R0027,Great value great food excellent staff lovely atmosphere well be back
R0027,Great variety on menu   excellent prices  great atmosphere 
R0027,Group of 9 booking for a 40th birthday  The food was amazing and service was fab  Its a very busy restaurant with a great Saturday night buzz  Very highly recommended 
R0027,Had a lovely afternoon for brunch  was nice to have live music too  Food was excellent as usual 
R0027,Had a lovely Birthday celebration with my husband  Fantastic food  atmosphere and service 
R0027,Had a lovely meal here the first time i ate in the restaurant  I thought the food was outstanding service impeccable  I was really looking forward to returning  however it was very disappointing on this return visit  We  felt the service was very slow  we were left waiting to order our drinks  there was numerous tables free around the restaurant but everyone coming in was put beside each other  The food i ordered  Chicken  was dry and i felt it had been reheated  After dinner the plates were left in front of us for ages before being cleared and then when they were  there was no offer of desert or another drink  We waited about ten/fifteen minutes and decided to leave  We had to find a waiter then to ask for the bill  While we were sitting waiting we could hear the waiters telling incoming customers that the tables needed to be back within a certain time and they hadnt even been seated  The people around us were also left for ages for their plates to be cleared away  My fiance however enjoyed his steak dinner 
R0027,Had worm on broccoli
R0027,Have been here a few times lately and love it  The food is excellent and the staff always friendly  Would highly recommend this restaurant and will definately be back again 
R0027,"Have eat in this restaurant several times but my last two visits were very disappointing very poor service waitress very abrupt and made us feel we were an inconvinance to her and we were taking up a table and her time 
Food was also disappointing 
On a positive note a Lady called Mary rang me day before my reservation to confirm 
What a lovely lady with a lovely manner some of your staff could take a leaf out of her book"
R0027,Having being a long time customer who always enjoyed the experience of dining    I was looking forward to having dinner there with my son on Friday 21st August  From the moment  we entered the restaurant I felt uncomfortable   
R0027,Having been before we expected a lot  We thought that everything was really great on the night though and think a lot off the food  service  athmosphere and  standards they achieved on the night  We really loved all from the elderflower cocktails to the finest off deserts and starters; and obliviously the mains too  We really recommend this restaurant and cant speak highly enough about it as it was really top class in every way and it seems to be able to cater for any need and even budget but more importantly its a really enjoyable night out in a city center location and we highly recommend to others as we think its one off the best in Dublin  It seems to be able to cater for all sizes of groups as well 
R0027,The guy on the desk was a little too loud  He actually reminded me of someone you would meet outside a restaurant in Spain who try to entice you into their restaurants   He was quite dismissive when I asked something about the menu  I got the impression he was in a rush  I noticed there was very few staff on and he was busy but I dont think that was my problem  We were there at five and it was six oclock before I noticed an increase in staff  During our time there several people came in and mentioned they had vouchers and this guy made a big deal of it which  Im sure was embarrassing for those customers    I was brought my dessert  but no spoon  All in all not what I would expect from this restaurant
R0027,Hen party screaming and shouting through entire dinner  not once asked to be quiet  More like Wetherspoons than a nice restaurant  Food comes out 2 mins after you order which means not made fresh and made in bulk  Wasnt warm  Older staff members have face like thunder  To top it off when I paid bill they didnt return with the change which was over  10 euros  I had to ask after 10 minutes where my change was and eventually it was dropped on the table with a �sorry about that�   Dont go here  spend your money elsewhere
R0027,Helpful manager  contacted the right ppl to get us to the right bar for the bar crawl  M
R0027,"Hi 
I was very disappointed with the service and felt we were being rushed to order and it almost felt like being 
on a conveyor belt rather than an upmarket restaurant and there was no real interaction with the waitress and waiter who served us the whole experience was soulless 
The person who brought the food out from the kitchen on occasions was the only person that we had positive interaction with 
It was a special occasion for myself and my partner and definitely would not recommend the restaurant to my friends 
I hope you find this helpful for the future "
R0027,Highly recommended for groups   two very nice set menus
R0027,I am more than happy with the place  The service and attention were fabulous 
R0027,I am sorry to give such bad marks but it does reflect my lack of enjoyment that night  I ordered lamb shank and was served what was like an old boot  We were a group of five and my colleagues were happy  The waiter did the decent thing and took the lamb off the bill and so the restaurant did what it could but that was still my experience on the night  Fortunately I have eaten there before and know that they can do much better and so this one bad experience will not stop me from going back
R0027,I booked a table for 10 people  advising I could receive around 15/18 people  They book me a table without space to fit that extra people  So  I have manage between 2 tables  There is not an individual bill  So in the end we have to split and I have to manage the situation for not be unfair  At any moment the place said the table will be only for 2 hours  so the staffs starting rushing with our food and drinks and asked us to leave it because we was 2 hours  All the time we are eating  drinking  having our desert  So  how when you celebrating a good occasion you have to ask your guests to go to other place because is only 2 hours  We expend over 400 euros between two tables in the end we had  We are a polite group  it is worth to register that information   So because of the system  the 2 hours  I dont recommend the place to someone will celebrate with a dinner a graduation or whatever the date  I do recommend the food  The food is excellent  The menu is suitable and affordable  The drinks as well  But that environment of rushing to give the table back  I do not recommended and if I knew this before I could arrange in other place  I am customer of Brassiere  I always go to have a lunch with my boyfriend and friends  I never see something like my day  Unfortunately  it is not a good place to have an occasion like that  Regards  Jackie
R0027,I booked for 5 people and we were left waiting outside the door for 10 minute even though we were on time  We were treated very abruptly by the staff who seemed hassled and unhappy We were asked to wait at the bar and when I ordered a round of drinks the barman told me to order from the waiter  When O tried to do that I was told to order from the bar  All this was done in a curt and dismissive way which put us all off even before the food was ordered The food was fine but the staff need some instruction on how to treat customers We felt that the food although very tasty was a bit overpriced and the general ambience was below par 
R0027,Hopefully with a bit of a human touch this can change the overall experience
R0027,I had a table booked for 4 people at 7 30 and we got our starters at 8 40  Myself and my wife ordered the half chicken which was  adequate but nothing more  I had dined here before and the food was excellent so it came as a surprise  We spent  Euro 250 for 4 people so would have expected more  Your wine is too expensive for this level of restaurant  A standard Malbec at  Euro 37 is too dear  We spent  Euro  70 on wine 
R0027,I had a great night went out for my boyfriends birthday  staff where so helpful  it was my first time going here on Saturday night and I will definitely be back  they have a whole vegetarian menu aswel  Open late  good prices for the quality is really good  Would highly recommend to all my work family and friends
R0027,"We had spoken about the situation we all felt that we were treated very badly due to the way we were dressed  my older brother mentioned that he had been subjected to this before  Were we wearing suits  No  we were wearing jeans and t shirts with metal bands displayed on them  and trainers  

I feel in 2018 that this type of treatment should not be still happening  We had taken a good look around the restaurant and everyone seemed to be receiving good service apart from us  the manager decided to take the staters off the bill to show that they dealt with the situation  In my opinion  no refund of money will amount to removing the bigotry in this restaurant "
R0027,"I had booked a table for 4 for my brothers stag and I was left disgusted by the treatment that we received from the restaurant  The service that we received was shocking  I feel that the waiter was not bothered about looking after us  We had to ask for the starter cutlery to be taken away  we had to ask another waiter for drinks  and then we realised that we were in the restaurant 1 hour 20 mins and we still had not received our mains  

I called for the manager and I was told that the food was coming  but we had spoken to the waiter 10 mins previous to this and he had told us the same thing  We decided to ask for the bill instead of waiting another 10 mins for our mains  the table behind us  they arrived after us  had finished their mains and was ordering dessert  "
R0027,"I had wanted to eat in your property for a while as i had heard good reviews but unfortunately my experience was not one of them 

The service was friendly but slow  the food was nice but overpriced  my biggest complaint was your bathrooms 
They were disgusting with no toilet roll in any of the ladies  puck and �other stuff� in most of them and worst  we complaint to our waiter about the toilets and my friend went down 30/40 min later and there was no change  Not even toilet roll in the cubicles 
Its an area that a restaurant should not be falling down on � even after we mentioned it "
R0027,I have been here before and the good was ok  It is quite average  I had the rotisserie chicken which was nice and I asked for roast potatoes advertised as cooked in duck fat so I imagined them to be crispy on the outside  They arrived and looked like they had been taken of another diners plate  They had some gravy over them  I didnt eat them  The breakfast was very poor everything over cooked and extremely expensive  All in all a very average experience and I would not be rushing back 
R0027,"I have been here a number of times  The food was always great and the staff was always nice 
But I went on saturday the 15th March 2014 and I would not return again The food was not good 
I got steak and the steak was very dry and did not have any taste 
I am very disppointed about the steak I got there "
R0027,I have been here a number of times   I have always found the staff nice   I have felt the food has gone down  I got steak with green beans and pesto under the steak and chips  I found the steak was a bit though  The pesto and green beans under the steak was not good  The taste used to be better  I asked for a side order of green beans  I got cabbage and green beans it was not good 
R0027,I have to say I was extremely disappointed with my visit  We couldnt get waitress to complain  Very poor and very expensive  Definitely wont be going back 
R0027,The service was poor and we had to wait for ages and finally ask someone else before we got our bill  I asked for duck  well done and my husband asked for steak rare  My duck was really pink and the steak really well done 
R0027,I loved the friendly atmosphere in the restaurant  the staff were very helpful and attentive  checking on our table during every course  The service was quick and the food was amazing  The bread they give you while youre waiting for your order is so good and I would highly recommend the goats cheese starter  One of our party had the slow cooked beef for her main and she said it was cooked to perfection  Everything about the restaurant is of a high standard without the high prices and we will definitely be back 
R0027,"I may have been inclined to write a better review if the friends who brought me hadnt gone on and on about how my mind was going to be blown apart by the sheer quality of the burger I was about to consume  

To be honest  as far as burgers go it was pretty average  �I dont think this place offers anything more special than what youd pick up   or even a pop up stall at an eat yard   which is why I couldnt understand the ridiculous waiting list to get into the place  �Thursday night was absolutely rammed and we had to wait in the rain for 20 mins  �I kept suggesting we should just walk a few paces to Gourmet Burger instead which had plenty of seats and a better menu   but they insisted on waiting 

The burger was juicy  but the bun was soft and soggy  �The fries werent at all flavorsome  just vehicles for salt   peanut oil fries have the edge  �The menu and choice of toppings was very limited and the beer selection wasnt great either  �Cant quite understand all the rave reviews  �At least it was cheap enough "
R0027,I think we just got a bad night but the surf and turf was extremely dry  
R0027, The surf and turf was extremely dry  It was also very expensive and we both left hungry 
R0027,I took a group of 7 out to this place as it seemed to cater for all tastes  We were seated right by the kitchen door after being offered the choice of high stool table or a regular table down back  It was nice to have the choice but the table was uncomfortable for us against the wall who had no space at all and my sister who was placed on the end directly in front of the service door  Starters were fine  nothing special  The Homemade bread went down great except we had no side plates so it was difficult to butter and share out  My Shaved Crunchy Veg salad was a salad greens with two halved cherry tomato  The Veg main tagine was a small glass bowl of weak tomato sauce+ 9 baby potatoes  I was told that was cos I ordered a cheap dish 
R0027,"I used to be a regular  Have not been in a year  menu far more expensive  a lot more food squished onto plates  but the quality was poor  Reheated  dried out veg and chicken  Where is the previous special touch and flair gone  
Waiter argued with us when wrong starters came  its a joke "
R0027,I was at this lovely little restaurant on Saturday Feb 24th  Myself and my partner had just got engaged and I have to say it was really good  food was amazing  lovely wine  great service so I would highly recommend this restaurant
R0027,I was quite disappointed with our experience at this place on Saturday 9th of April  O The waiting staff were abrupt  bordering on rude to me as I tried to get their attention to place our order  Despite our 2045h booking it was close to 2230 when we got our main courses  When we did one serving of lamb was completely under cooked  which to be fair we were not charged for   My tortellini pasta was also undercooked to the point of having a hard texture  I did not make a complaint as I was by that stage so hungry due to the long waiting time  Our group of 5 friends had not met up in some time and I had been very much looking forward to the evening but I wont be eating here again 
R0027,I was sent an email wishing me a happy birthday and offer of free main course  We opted to avail of this deal however when we went to pay the bill we were told we could not avail of free main for the birthday girl  which was disappointing  Waiter advised us about some nonsense about  showing email before of after bill arrived    From customer service side of things crazy process  Either customer can avail of offer or not  
R0027,"I was short changed and when I tried to get their attention to point this out they kept walking past me  so I had to leave it  
We were served a smoothie instead of a cocktail and then there was confusion as to which cocktail was alcohol free  
It was a bit of a conveyor belt with different waiters appearing at the table throughout out the meal  
They used frozen French fries which were soggy  usually the French fries are really good there  
I thought it was expensive for what we actually got  
Disappointing because its usually good and the person who did actually serve us our food was very pleasant "
R0027,"I was very disappointmented  Food was not good  I was surprised given all the good reviews  The steak had minimal flavor and was over cooked  Waitress never came back to check on how our meal was  Salad leaves had gone bad on my dish  although my husband salad was fine 
I would not recommend this restaurant "
R0027,"I went for dinner and ordered off the set menu and had mentioned when booking that i had allergies 

They didnt pay any head to these needs and I was very ill after the meal 

They advertise that ten food is gluten free but I am not quite sure that it is "
R0027,I went there last Saturday with my boyfriend who isnt a veggie  He liked his steak  our wine was nice  the waiters very smiley  all this was good  but I was really disappointed by two things: on the special vegetarian menu  2 out of 4 meals had parmesan  which is not vegetarian  I know most non veggie people dont know about this though  Second thing was the meal I chose  the aubergine dish that sounded lovely on the card  but it ended up being tasteless  the pasta felt like they were soaked in ketchup  the patty looked like one of those frozen premade one  Could you please make a better effort on this so veggies can enjoy this restaurant with their non veggie friends  Thanks 
R0027,"I went to this place couple of weeks ago to celebrate a birthday and all of us were very disappointed with the restaurant 
I specifically mentioned on my reservation that there was a birthday celebration and they did not have any gesture at all
Also  there was one person allergic to nuts and from the very beginning they were quite hostile and rude  saying that EVERYTHING may contain nuts  from bread to every single dessert  without offering any alternative 
Food was tasteless  i e chicken was dry 
Service was slow and unfriendly
Definitely we will not come back"
R0027,I wont be going back  Felt rushed by staff  music too loud  food mediocre
R0027,I wouldnt return   The food was just ok  The cocktails were terrible
R0027,Ive always heard good reviews  I have been twice and both times i was disappointed  Poor choice in the menu and portions are extremely small for the price  which is not cheap  Also every time I had to wait hours for the food to show up  Again food is on average and for the price asked it is not worth a lunch/dinner 
R0027,"I saw one mans order being given to someone else and no apology offered when he called it out  simply being told ""it is being made now""  but he had put his order in long before those who got the order  An espresso was made and sat left on the side for 5 minutes before the diner had to come up and ask for her coffee  There was only two staff  one lady on the till  one male chef in the kitchen  Im not sure if the lady was new but she was definitely a hindrance  I felt sorry for the chef as he was only getting orders passed through to him on post its and seemingly in random order 

I credit the fact that they are making the pasta fresh  but they need to sort out their staff  I will give this place another go to actually taste the food but first impressions are absolutely terrible "
R0027,Incredibly slow service and just a basically poor experience  With so many options out there  this one is to be skipped past   
R0027,It is always a very solid choice for either meeting friends/family or a date  I love the relaxed feel of this place  really enjoyable ambiance   The food is always so tasty and is reasonably priced  the set menus can offer great value  I definitely would return again and again  Service was well timed and friendly  Staff were very accommodating and were willing to spend time explaining the dishes or wine if you wanted  HIGHLY RECOMMEND 
R0027,It is my 4th time since November eating at the restaurant after 3 times of incredible dining  this time we were  sorely dissapointed  I ordered a burger and it was hard as rock  and I wasnt even asked how I would like it cooked 
R0027,It was quite a poor experience  I was just left disappointed with it overall  For 75 euro plus tip 80 euro I would not return to be honest  It wasnt the worst experience ever but expectation for such an established dublin restaurant left me disappointed  We had a meat platter the chicken was dry the cut of steak was quite thin and small and by the time we got to the pork chop it was cold  Why not put less on the plate with better quality instead of going for quantity  I will say your sweet potato wedges were very nice  The staff were also friendly 
R0027,It was very friendly and the food was excellent
R0027,Lively place with a great atmosphere  Wonderful menu  and  good wine list too  Loved every bite 
R0027,Love the place  friendly and attentive staff  great food and lovely atmosphere
R0027,Love this place  have been there so many times  Great location  tasty food and live Jazz music 
R0027,"Love this place  from the minute we arrived we felt at home by the staff  The menu is extensive  plenty of options but we decided to go with pre theatre  The food was great  we had meatballs and Gazpacho to start  chicken and sausage for mains  Good hearthy size portions and delicious 
All in all  would highly recommend  great food  very friendly and welcoming service and good atmosphere "
R0027,Loved it  Fantastic food    must try the chicken  Definetely give the cocktails a go too 
R0027,Lovely food and really friendly and attentive staff 
R0027,Lovely food  attentive staff  great ambiance
R0027,Lovely food  lovely staff and great service 
R0027,Lovely meal  great food and friendly service  One of dublins best eateries 
R0027,Lovely restaurant to visit anytime   Staff are efficient  friendly and food is great value   Highly recommend for all to visit   Looking forward to returning soon again 
R0027,Lovely restaurant  beautiful food and friendly staff   Highly recommended
R0027,Lovely staff added to great food equalled brilliant night
R0027,Manager was very rude  will never go back
R0027,"Meh  I mean  theres nothing really special about this place  I mostly come here with co workers because my office is pretty close and the proximity makes this a convenient choice  The food is overpriced and average    especially if you dont consume meat  The drinks are just   standard  I really like ambience which is probably what you end up paying for but there really isnt much apart from that 
"
R0027,"My girlfriend and I visited for our Valentines dinner  We were seated quickly and presented with the bottle of champagne  Laurent Perrier Rose  at  Euro 125 per bottle  that I had requested on arrival  Unfortunately that is where the good things I have to say about this experience end  After receiving our starters   Chicken Liver Parfait with black raisins and toasted brioche and Warmed Goats Cheese Tart with caramelized onions  and rocket which were decent enough  but not amazing by any means   we were seemingly forgotten about 

After finishing our starters we waited for a significant period of time  55 minutes  during which time we finished our champagne and ordered another bottle   I inquired as to the status of our mains and the hostess  whom I believe was a manager  went to the kitchen to check on it 

I had ordered the fillet steak  medium rare  and my girlfriend had ordered the Rotisserie 1/2 Cherry Valley Duck  What arrived at our table  with apologies for the delay  was an entirely rare steak that had been quickly seared rather than cooked as per my request  I do eat steak rare so this wasnt a major problem for me but with the wait etc  I wasnt at all satisfied with it  My girlfriends duck is cooked medium rare by this restaurant but was slightly undercooked  and the duck fat potatoes which arrived with them were lukewarm 

The waitress  manager   came back over about a minute and a half after we had received our mains asking if everything was okay but we hadnt really had a chance to sample our food and we didnt want to wait another 20+ minutes for another dish to be prepared  As a result we gave the usual ""yes  thanks""  however it really was a very lackluster dining experience  To their credit the duck was removed from the bill  and I understand that at busy times like Valentines Day mistakes can happen  but we certainly will not be returning to this place in the future "
R0027,My meal arrived without a main ingredient crab claws  When I sent it back  there was no explanation or apology  Overall I found the service quite poor and have experienced this a few times In this restaurant  Overpriced for what it is 
R0027,My third occasion to dine here  I am fast becoming a regular  Love the food  simple food done with a touch of flair  Great service from friendly staff each time  I brought my partner and ate the rib again which i had last time  highly recommend and will be back  We also got a complimentary glass of proseco for booking online 
R0027,My wife and I and two adult children ate at this restaurant on a Monday evening and the place was busy  which tells me they are doing something right  They had a fairly extensive mixed cocktail list  which I found out is not easy to find in Ireland  the service was attentive without being overly so and our food was excellent  I had the braised short rib with polenta    I highly recommend this restaurant
R0027,My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary here  the food was excellent and service 1st class even though it was extremely busy  Highly recommended 
R0027,Myself and my husband were very much looking forward to eating here on new years eve  we both decided to order off the set menu  The starters were disappointing   My salad leaves were huge and I felt the dish was very awkward to eat  My husbands crab salad was nothing special   For my main I ordered the steak but when it arrived it looked more like a burger I was very disappointed   My husband ordered the chicken and he too was disappointed   For dessert I had pecan pie served with creme anglaise and ice cream  The creme anglaise may as well have been left off the plate as it was such a tiny amount I didnt get to really taste it I also found it extremely dry  My husband had the peanut butter mousse and were both in agreement it was the best course of the night  The service was quite slow we were waiting ages between meals for plates to be lifted   Overall we were very disappointed  I had been here once before and based on that I recommended we book again 
R0027,Nice atmosphere with great service and good food  Will visit again for sure 
R0027,Nice decor and very friendly waiting staff   Too pricey for what we got for starter and main course 
R0027,Nice food and good quality and friendly staff  the food comes quick wont let u wait so long time
R0027,Nice venue  Food was okay  had higher expectations  Nice starters  Disappointing service  some staff seemed unsure and gave the impression they didnt want you to ask for something when they came to the table  Service was quite slow also  When leaving the girl who looked after us to pay the bill and a manger were helpful 
R0027,Nice  but overpriced for Sunday brunch  Staff very nice with a good buzzy atmosphere
R0027,Noisy busy place  Average all round 
R0027,Not at all impressed with this restaurant to be honest  The food was very poor  and  the portions were measly  Avoid the chicken pie if you actually want to eat some chicken     it had all of 3 pieces inside         Very full to the point of being overcrowded with a very noisy atmosphere  It had the feel of a Mc Donalds  and  to be frank im sorry I didnt go there for something to eat  the food would have been much better for a fraction of the cost   
R0027,Didnt bother with a desert or drinks  and  couldnt get out of there quick enough 
R0027,"Not impress by the food quality  Got a rib eye steak not tender at all 
Very expensive "
R0027,Not Very pleased with my pork  Found the menu to be a bit pricey though  we went elsewhere for dessert 
R0027,Now i remember why we stopped going here  the tables are so squashed together that you can barely move into your place  poor managing of seating as there were loads of tables available but they just shove everyone into one space 
R0027,Although the food was good the barman made the most wishey washiest Bloody Mary i have ever tasted  So all in all   i would not be going back here or recommending it
R0027,Once again excellent  Staff and food are top notch 
R0027,Ordered surf and Turf  at  Euro 30 50 steak was extremely tough  Sent it back and a beautiful piece of meat was covered in salt leaving it inedible  Two chances to get it right and failed both times  Amusingly enough my friends dish was bland and needed lots of seasoning 
R0027,"Our visit was ok  Nothing stands out as exceptional  The service was below average    we had to look for a waitress several times  The food was ok   
They definitely need to move up a notch on all fronts to compete with all the great brunch spots in Dublin 
We wont be rushing back "
R0027,"Over priced for below average food  
Food was bland and taistless  It wasnt over busy yet staff acting like headless chickens  No changing facilities for babies  Wont be back"
R0027,"Over priced  over cooked and under seasoned 

Both mains were so far over cooked from what was asked for   Veg and sides were incredibly bland and lacking any sort of seasoning whatsoever 

Peanut butter moose for dessert that tasted like chocolate  too much chocolate on the dessert  If it labelled as peanut butter I would expect peanut butter to be the main flavour and not be over powered by so much chocolate 

Starters were outstanding  in saying that one of them was a salad would be a one star review if you couldnt make a good salad 

Staff were very nice though"
R0027,Overall our meal was lovely  But i had the steak and it was very very fatty  We where there on a deal from the dining  club and felt that i got a fatty piece of beef because we where on a deal
R0027,Overall  I thought the only real upside was the quality of the food  I thought it was amazing  Unfortunately this was let down by a number of factors  Firstly  we were seated right by the door  Myself and my girlfirend were celebrating 5 years together and were made feel like animals at a zoo with people constantly coming up and looking through the glass pane  Secondly  while the service was very swift and friendly it was a bit off putting to have a bottle of water slammed down on your table every 20 minutes  Also the fact that we could not get a dessert from the set menu as something had gone wrong in the kitchen  I understand that these things happen but it was just a bit off putting  Lastly  the entire restaurant was filled with smoke  causing the fire alarm to go off twice  Then the glass pane that we were sitting at had to be opened so we were effectively sitting in the doorway  Overall I thought the food was lovely  The incidents that happened were all very minor but accumulated to a very underwhemling experience as we had chosen this place to celebrate this event in our lives based on hearing many good reviews 
R0027,"Overpriced cheap food 
We ordered to deliver and we were expecting way more  Ordered the special bacon burger and chicken wings  At first We were amazed by the presentation and how that looked  but then we tried    And it was just disappointing "
R0027,Overpriced  Brunch sizing but main coruse evening meal prices     One steak was completly overdone 
R0027,Pancakes arrived to the table and were burned  Toasted ham and cheese was OK 
R0027,"Party of 10 including 3 children  A friend was first to arrive and was told there was no booking despite me having received e mail confirmation  and  also a reminder e mail the day before  However  they were able to seat us  We ordered some drinks  and  part of this order was 2 pints of Guinness  We had to ask 3 or 4 times over the next 20 minutes was the Guinness coming  and  when it eventually arrived they brought just 1 pint  Food arrived quickly when we were eventually asked if we wanted to order  and  was nice but nothing to get too excited about  The restaurant website talked about ""family friendly"" but the staff made us feel like a nuisance when buggies arrived  There was no childrens menu but menu items were adapted to suit  Overall pretty average"
R0027,Parents said it was fantastic  so Im well in the good books now so thanks 
R0027,"Party place with lively atmosphere and good service but overpriced and distinctly average food 
Special mention for the Pecan pie with Chocolate Ice cream  Probably the worst dessert Ive had the displeasure of eating "
R0027,Perfect dining experience from beginning to end  Food and service excellent 
R0027,"Personally  I quite like to be treated nicely in a restaurant  no matter how hip or edgy it is  I dont appreciate being shouted over to the next table by the waiting staff; I dont appreciate being given dessert menus when Ive asked three times for the bill; I dont expect dirty  used glasses to be left on the table and not cleared away upon our arrival   let alone left throughout the meal 

Food was good  though  Shame about the appalling service "
R0027,Pican pie was the best thing ive ever eaten in last 5 years maybe   
R0027,Place was so loud you could not hear yourself think  Do not go if your planning a nice quiet meal with husband   Food was over priced  I was so disappointed  The chicken wings were so dry 
R0027,The worst was the lamb chop served on lettuce  The staff were nice but I would not go back or recommend Im afraid 
R0027,"Quite disappointed with my meal  Felt it was very over priced for what I got  Was charged offered more bread with my starter and was charged for it and not told in advance  Meal was very expensive as is  surely bread could be thrown in for free  Not a great wine list  Abrupt service  I felt rushed during my meal
By waiting staff  No sense of occiasion  Sitting extremely close to the table next to us  Overall would not recommend "
R0027,Quite disappointed  Seated at walkway so EVERY single time anyone passed I was bumped off    a LOT  Food was good  asked for rare steak but was not rare   didnt have time to send back  Music extremely loud so unable to hear conversation  Staff very rushed and came across agitated and almost rude  Asked for cocktail and waited 25min  asked again and arrived to table a further 20min later  Coats stored in filthy cupboard with cleaning products  Was really looking forward to eating here  ate here a lot when it first opened and unfortunately do not think we will be back 
R0027,Really chilled atmosphere  Great food  Great service
R0027,"Really enjoy visiting Dublin regularly  We try to dine in somewhere different every time  This place read well on trip advisor and looked well on website  
Restaurant entrance filthy outside and in  
Salmon main overcooked with plain lettuce leaves which were supposed to be braised  Mushrooms drowned in oil  Chips cold  "
R0027,"Toilets needed attention  
Couldnt wait to get out of the place  
Will never be back  "
R0027,Really enjoyed lunch here  Staff were amazing and the food was really good  Could not fault it 
R0027,Really enjoyed our lunch  Nice food  Friendly staff  Highly recommended 
R0027,Really good meal  would recommend 
R0027,Really great restaurant for a group  Fun atmosphere and great food and cocktails
R0027,Really loved the whole vibe   Food was amazing   Drinks were fab  Service was excellent   
R0027,Really lovely place for lunch  Good service and food  Large portions  we shared  
R0027,Regular food at high price  Service prompt  but not especially friendly 
R0027,"Restaurant was overpriced compared to the quality of the service and food  our table was not ready when we arived even if we have booked for a specific time  Items on the menue was not available even stated that they should have them on Saturdays  apparently they only made 2 of them  and this was not stated on the menu 
Waiter was stressfull and we wher in and out including starter + main in less than 1 hour "
R0027,Rotisserie chicken was fabulous 
R0027,Seriously overpriced for the amount of food they serve 
R0027,Seriously overpriced for the amount of food they serve   left feeling ripped off and hungry 
R0027,"Service below average  Bring part I your order    Ie no sides or one of our drinks and make you wait and then have to ask again for it  Too casual service for the price 
Then the meat on first taste is beautiful until you realise that less than 20 pc of your portion is meat and the rest is streaky fat  Even the potatoes were over cooked and badly flavoured  Overall v  Disappointing 

Then the bill     2 mains  glass of wine  glass of beer and a tea and coffee cam to 80e    Poor in the value stakes 

Wont be returning or recommending"
R0027,Wont be returning or recommending
R0027,"Service from our waitress wasnt great which was a shame as very important family occasion 
Inattentive and somewhat rude"
R0027,Service good and good value for money  Would return again
R0027,Service here is amazing     They will bring chairs to you if you are standing and always aware if your drink is empty  Way better then the US
R0027,Service rushed  steak served cold   table waiters pleasant but overall not great value for Monday
R0027,Service was excellent and the food delicious and even though there was a lot of people there it didnt impact on us
R0027,Service was sub par  Went for the set menu  but everything took so long  never made it to the desert  Waitress was lovely  but was so unattentive we didnt squeeze desert into a 2 hour seating  Of course set menu was still full price however  Wont be returning  Food was ok  Doesnt really warrant the price but was ok  Probably wont return or recommend       
R0027,Service was very very poor  We were never asked if we wanted a second drink even in two hours  and  then when we asked for the menu and decided to have a drink nobody came back to us even to take the order  We were ready for another drink but we had to beg someone to come back to us so at that stage we just got the bill which was another expedition and took way too long 
R0027,Service with a smile  Lovely experience  thoroughly enjoyed it  Will be back again soon 
R0027,"Sloppy service  freidly though  we were left for ages without drinks and then food came too soon after  Crab starter didnt taste fresh enough  Main course of Half roast chicken  tasty  but too big for 1 person  Looked vulgar on the plate   Deserts were nice 
I wouldnt recommend this restaurant "
R0027,The Surf n Turf was poor  The steak was very dry and overcooked  The wedges served with it also very dry 
R0027,Someone else said this is the worst pizza in Dublin  Wish Id read that before  The salad was good  Wine was fine  On the plus side when I mentioned how much I didnt like the pizza they took it off my bill  Thats worth something 
R0027,Spectacular Eggs Benedict  amazing Bloody Mary  Im sure everyone elses food was great too 
R0027,Staff and service brilliant unfortunately the surroundings were cramped and overcrowded  The restaurant was so busy when we arrived we were full of optimism about the standard of food BUT it was absolutely tasteless and reminded us of food served at a bad function  Disappointed as we were using a token which  was a Christmas present coupled with a birthday treat 
R0027,Staff were  very attentive but food was very average 
R0027,"Starter of smoked salmon and brown bread is hard to get wrong 
Main course was chicken pie   chicken still on bone which was very hard to eat when it is in deep dish and covered with layer of pastry 
Dessert of bread and butter pudding was tasty but took an age to come even though the restaurant had emptied out  We then sat with desserts for another 5 mins until cutlery arrived so that we could eat them 
Restaurant was very busy   staff kept forgetting drink orders and bar was unable to cope with demand  I asked for another pint and the waitress gave me the excuse of the bar being very busy   how long does it take to pull a pint of five lamps 
Cocktails were well presented "
R0027,"Starter lovely  desert lovely  Main only fair 
Cocktails very nice and so was the Beer "
R0027,Starters were good but portions too big   Mains were v disappointing   I dont feel as though I got value for money  the food was only ok    The staff were friendly and helpful  ambience was good but I wouldnt rush back 
R0027,Too hot   heating pumping out and unable to turn it off when requested  
R0027,Steak fatty  no sides   service slow 
R0027,Steaks mediocre   potatoes undercooked and inedible but they provided mash replacement quickly    Versus last time we were there it just seems quality of food has slipped   Service seemed rushed 
R0027,Stuck in a room out the back  And was the worst seat in the house
R0027,Superb night here  Highly recommended  We opted for their rotisserie selection  I having the lamb  it was melt off the bone delicious  My partner having the striploin which was so tasty  A lovely bottle of Tempranillo later and a couple of cocktails and we left after a wonderful night  Staff are very friendly and helpful here adding to the overall experience 
R0027,Superb Restaurant in the heart of busy city centre  We were looked after extremely well indeed  Service EXCELLENT  Food DELICIOUS   I highly recommend this restaurant and cant wait for my next trip to Dublin to go again  Try the Gin Garden Cocktail  yum 
R0027,My companion asked for burger  It came out too raw for her couldnt eat it  Said to staff who said it is always made pink  No one said that at ordering stage if had very well done would have been requested  Burger was brought back to kitchen  Same burger returned as companion had cut hers in half and it was still too raw for her  Staff did deduct from bill but evening was ruined as I ate main course alone and companion had none  Not what I expected from this Restaurent  We could have gone to many others and will certainly in the future 
R0027,Cracked water glass on table we were shown to  Asked for g and t it came with tonic added to the full rather than me suiting my taste
R0027,Terrible meal  Herded through like cattle and served raw salmon    twice  Staff ignorant and overall rushed service of food that had obviously been prepared in advance  Shockingly disappointing eaxperience 
R0027,Terrible service  decent to good food 
R0027,"The atmosphere was good and the waitress was very friendly but other than that I was not too impressed considering this place would be considered as high quality dining  Myself and my boyfriend sat there waiting for about 20 minutes before any waitress or waiter approached our table with menus  I had to ask twice for a fork as the table was not set properly  
The starters were good and I really recommend the pate 
My main course was absolutely awful and resembled something that you would get in your local pub on the carvery menu  Its very hard to go wrong with chicken and I was expecting creamy mashed potatoe and a lovely gravy jus  The base of the dish was green peas swimming in watery gravy   The potatoes were soggy from all the gravy and then there was just half a chicken lumped on top of the potatoes  It lacked any flavour and the chicken was plain and dry  I could only manage a few bites  
Unfortunately I will not be returning "
R0027,The Brunch Lunch Menu was very limited  The Service was poor  we thought the restaurant was not too busy so could not understand why the table service seemed to take forever    we were sitting with menus for twenty minutes before being asked did we want a drink  It started badly and never really recovered from that  Im sure younger people will love it  but for us middle aged ones  I expected better 
R0027,The evening was lovely  the food was gorgeous as always and our waiter  Oliver  was a gent 
R0027,"The fish served was of a very poor quality  We were told it was fresh 
But it was definitely not "
R0027,The food is overpriced for the quality  the starters were nice but the mains were disappointing  Also  the service is fairly slow  there were at least 20 minutes in between each course 
R0027,The food was average   My cod  potato and spinach was floating in an inch deep pool of watery yellow liquid which wasnt nice  The Christmas menu was quite limited  The service was not great  we were not approached during our meal to ask if everything was ok  we had to try to find someone to ask for drinks/sauce etc  I wouldnt recommend this place to a friend 
R0027,"The food was disappointing  Smoked salmon starter was simple but nice  The salmon was very good quality and the brown bread was very tasty  I got short rib beef for the main course and it was very disappointing  The beef was ok but not fully there in terms of ""falling off the bone""  The main problem was the sweet potato wedges which had a very sharp taste  which I think came from some sort of a citrus creme fraiche type accompaniment  and they just didnt go with the beef  There was also a lack of sauce/gravy  Overall there are a myriad of sweet potato/chip options and I think they would be better served concentrating on a few classics  There were 4 people at our table and there were 2 different types of sweet potato wedges and 2 different kinds of chips  Nobody at the table complimented the food  The atmosphere was great and the location is excellent but the standard of the food lags well behind "
R0027,The food was excellent  But the service was like something from Fawlty Towers  The waitress was rude  she wouldnt walk around the other side of the table to pick up the plate from the table so we had to hand our plates to her  She snapped at us because we didnt want any starters  My guests were not English speakers and neither was the waitress but she sighed heavily when they asked her to repeat what she just said  This was the worst possible service  She slopped the wine into our glasses so much that I though it would spill onto me 
R0027,The food was nice but very pricey   There was a party on and  the noise was ridiculous  I was on a date but Instead of trying to enjoy it  just wanted to get in and get out  I would suggest a separate area for a large group of people so that  others in the restaurant can enjoy their experience 
R0027,The food was OK  certainly not outstanding  and for what it was not good value 
R0027,The food was very overpriced  I ordered surf and turf for 30 Euro medium to well  The steak was overdone and tasteless  The potato wedges were hard in the inside  my husbands burger was very dry and he didnt finish it  Our table was so close to two other tables that we felt we were dining with 4 strangers  It was so packed and noisy  definitely would not recommend overall  Very disappointed 
R0027,The food was very well presented  however it was incredibly salty 
R0027,The menu on the night was OK but would go back again
R0027,The only down fall is the toliets are down steep stairs  but over all a great restaurant 
R0027,The place is very good but the food in not balaced With the price 
R0027,The place looks great and so does the food  The waiter was really welcoming and gave us advice about the menu  We only had a main course  A beef rib and tuna  The food looked great but the taste wasnt unfortunately  Everything was so salty  The tuna was horrible  They even put a lot of salt on the side salad  Such a shame  I was so excited when our food arrived  When i tried to tell the waiter  he waived it off 
R0027,"The restaurant had a group of 130 people  They could not handle this group AND the tables in front of the restaurant  We were told to wait for our main course  for at least one hour after we finished our starters  They offered us a glass of prosecco at the main course but we were not in the mood for prosecco  we already had red wine   
At the end  we got a couple drinks off the check because of the inconvenience  This was the least they could do and that made our feeling a bit better  But overall  it was not a good evening for us and we wont be back  unfortunately"
R0027,I dont expect authentic Italian pizza    but taste and quality should be in order  Maybe it was a mistake  but then the staff should have handled it better   instead of making us feel bad 
R0027,The restaurant was really cold  the service was poor and the food was just ok and it was over priced 
R0027,The service charge of 12 5 percent drove our bill up by another 50 Euro  disgraceful  We would have given a generous tip but not 50 Euro  would not go back 
R0027,"The service was fine 
However we were waiting along time for our food 
When the food came out it seemed as if it had been sitting under the hot lights foot a while before it got brought to our table 
Over all  
Disappointing experience"
R0027,The service was quite poor   We were waiting quite a long time for our food order to be taken and were not offered drinks whilst we were waiting   There were mistakes with our order   which were not even apologised for   Also  is it really necessary for the waiter to roar out the name of each dish as he is serving to find out who ordered it  
R0027,One person did not order from the set menu and they were never offered desert  Overall we were never asked did we want to reorder drinks or tea or coffee 
R0027,The service was terrible  the waitress could only take the order in a clockwise order and couldnt finish with the one person who arrived last 
R0027,"The staff was so friendly and professional  nevertheless they were very pushy to take our orders on arrival 
My pi�a colada didnt taste like pineapple  coconut or rum at all  it was just watery and had no flavour  it wasnt cheap 
I was still hungry after having the sea bass with a few tiny potatoes 
They charged us for an extra half bottle of wine and we were lucky enough to double check the bill before paying 
The atmosphere was somehow chaotic  We didnt enjoy our experience at all "
R0027,The waitress was quite abrupt and tried to rush us  We were then charged for the wrong set menu and had to ask them to change it  Very pricey for what it was   Rotisserie chicken and the burger were very dry 
R0027,Theres not much to recommend this place    Innateness service and uninspired food 
R0027,This is the best Italian restaurant in Dublin  Most authentic   Great staff with lots of personality  Fantastic Chef  Highly recommend  
R0027,This place is top notch   Great experience from start to finish   food is amazing   Highly recommended     
R0027,"This unhappy  robotic attitude continued on  throughout the course of her taking our order  There was no small talk  no mention of the specials  not even as much as a ""how are you  "" After placing the whole order and her walking away from the table  �she came back and decided to tell us that two of the soft drinks we ordered werent there  Not her fault I guess  but it definitely didnt help her case 
"
R0027,This was a disappointing visit  I have eaten here on a number of occasions but I wont be going back anytime soon  The food was out almost immediately which is never a good sign and the quality was poor  Frozen peas and lukewarm mash with the roast chicken and fish which tasted of nothing much accompanied by veg which were at best lukewarm  Its not cheap here and I expect more 
R0027,This was a friends night out and it was fantastic from the food  to the fabulous house red wine to the atmosphere and of course the service pretty well the best night out we all had in a while   So highly recommend   Fabulous 
R0027,Too expensive for what it was  tiny portion for fine dining prices 
R0027,The surf nd turf looked like a meals on wheels dinner for the elderly  tasted so salty and the food mix didnt work well together  Been to close to 40 present of dublin restaurants over the years  this was the worst 
R0027,Took the waiter 20 minutes to visit our table for the first time  he only came by once or twice and was rushing  
R0027,Food was average at best  Came here a year ago and it was the exact opposite  5 stars  But it seems things have gone way downhill since then  I would give the service negative stars if I could 
R0027,Two workmen joined us at the next row of tables as they were repairing a broken shutter  A drill and a hammer were not appreciated nor did we receive an apology   Euro 10 for a glass of wine was also extortionate  Wont be back and Ill tell others about my visit of the suggest it in future 
R0027,Um  no  I still have a stomach ache from last nights meal 
R0027,Unfortunately the food isnt worth the money  Staff were very nice 
R0027,Unfortunately the service was below par  we had to wait a long time for drinks that we ordered  A lot of the table didnt finish their food as the quality of the Cesar salad  and  burgers was not good at all 
R0027,"Unfortunately we did not have a good experience   I have been here many times and loved it so chose it especially for my birthday   
We didnt receive our cheese board even though we asked for it twice   "
R0027,"While we were still waiting for the cheese board   Even though we told her we still hadnt received all of our order she did nothing about it and continued to try to promote the other venues   
The waiter questioned that one of us was ordering off the set menu   told her she wasnt and that he would have taken note of it if she was  
I was very embarrassed to have recommended this place to my friends and disappointed with our night out for my birthday "
R0027,Used the voucher  pre theatre menu for two people  with cocktails and house wine for 50 EUR   Good value for the amount of food  but still not worth it  The food was obviously pre prepared and of low quality  Overdone meat  Nothing we couldnt have made better at home  As it was a voucher  they were trying to rush us out the door  Wont go again 
R0027,Very average in every way  For the price of the food on offer I had expected something better 
R0027,very bad value for  money  will not go again   i have been to restaurant numerous times and the food standard has  really decreased   cold potatoes were served  tasteless chicken and this is just with one  course   best option   avoid
R0027,"Very busy buzzy place   starters were only average   our main courses of steak were poor and expensive 
The steak was chewy and when i told the waiter all i got was a shrug of the shoulders 
So overall not very impressed 
The place appeared to me to be too busy and perhaps a bit under pressure"
R0027,Very delicious food  great and kind service  flexible in changing or deleting ingredients
R0027,Very disappointed with set meal quality  Ate there before and was good but not this time  Would not go back in a hurry  What happened   
R0027,Very disappointing quality of the food was v v poor 2 dishes had to be returned   felt like we were on a conveyor belt might have just been a xmas thing but we wont be returning
R0027,Very disappointing  fish was not hot  duck too much ft
R0027,Very disappointing   Average food which could have been enhanced by good service but the service was terrible   We had a  sour server with no sense of humor or engagement   We were kept waiting  for our food drink and offered some nonsense about ordering foods at certain temperatures  medium        No service recovery or much of an apology   I wouldnt go back 
R0027,Very expensive and nothing special   5 of us dined here and none of us were overly impressed with any element of the night  Would not go again 
R0027,Very expensive restaurant with substandard food  The meat was over cooked  burnt  and had too much fat 
R0027,Very friendly  helpful staff   can swap desserts for a cocktail  great food
R0027,Very nearly walked out and wont be back because of one individual 
R0027,Very nice brunch and service was quick and with a smile 
R0027,Very nice brunch menu  great drinks and nice ambiance  A piano player in the afternoon on Sunday 
R0027,Very nice food and a lovely atmosphere  Great service also 
R0027,Very nice food and good sized portions   early bird great value
R0027,Very nice restaurant but good way over priced compared to other restaurants 
R0027,"very nice  
friendly staff  
nice cocktails   
good atmosphere   
prices were pretty good"
R0027,Very noisy restaurant  Staff very helpful  Were overcharged on our bill in error  One of the burgers was very undercooked and had to be returned 
R0027,Very poor food  Burgers each  Burger chewy and bun hard  Some chips hard also  Got coffee and one was cold and one was scalding hot
R0027,"Very poor service
Tables very close together 
Food average"
R0027,"Very rude staff
43 euros menu compulsory for groups of more than 6 people : doesnt make any sense
The meat was way overcooked I couldnt eat it  we didnt have the choice of the cooking  "
R0027,Very slow at getting food out  a number of tables who arrive after us had there food before we had  Would not be booking again in the near future
R0027,"Very small portions for the french toast
Tasteless eggs"
R0027,Visited just before Christmas and it was very busy  The food was poor with the exception of the roast chicken which was good  Hamburger was enormous but absolutely incinerated and virtually inedible  The only good thing that I could say was that the tomato accompanying the hamburger was delicious   about all that I could happily eat  Chips tasteless  Service disinterested  Prices are not particularly cheap   Overall very poor value for a very poor meal 
R0027,Warm welcome  great staff  amazing food  and the deserts are to die for   
R0027,We  squad of 18  went there for brunch on Saint Patricks day and got eggs Benedict and bottomless mimosas  worth every penny they were very good about continuously bringing more rounds  Also the eggs Benedict was absolutely amazing  Highly recommend  great place with great food and a nice staff 
R0027,We booked the restaurant on a number of very good reviews  It was a Sunday evening so we were expecting it to be busy but not mobbed  the food was tasty although both of our meals were cold when they arrived  The waiter also forgot the gluten free bread that my wife had asked for despite being reminded on more than one occaision  So all in all a little dissapointing 
R0027,We booked this restaurant due to its location which is ideal  The decor is great and the staff attentive  The menu was simple  therefore one would expect easy to execute  My biggest gripe was with the quality of the food  Unimaginative and disappointing  My impression was that the menu was planned to realise the biggest mark up possible and take advantage of the christmas trade  This is the 2nd time I have eaten here and unfortunately had the same experience the last time  I think this venue operates better as a cocktail bar and not a serious restaurant
R0027,We enjoyed a really lovely evening  with great food  drink and excellent service 
R0027,"We had a horrible service experience   Took over an hour and 15 minutes for our mains to arrive   People who sat down on either side of us  after we had been there already 30 minutes  received their mains and consumed them before ours ever appeared   Our original waiter disappeared  We were given no information except ""the kitchen is busy"" by someone else we had to flag down   Steak was overcooked when it arrived "
R0027,We had a horrible service experience   Waited over an hour to get served
R0027,We had a lovely meal and and the wait staff were very helpful 
R0027,We had a splendid evening  Copious amounts of delightful food and wine with plenty of choice  Highly recommend 
R0027,We had a tiny table and were intruded upon by the waiter serving an adjacent table  The food was nice but over seasoned and salty  We felt it was overpriced for the quality and quantity of food offered  Wait service was friendly and reasonably prompt but not skilled  We would not return nor would we recommend this restaurant 
R0027,We had breakfast   pancakes and French toast and a berry smoothie  everything was very delicious   The service was very attentive and kind 
R0027,"We have been to the restaurant many times both as a couple and with family and I was surprised on this occasion at the increase in prices  We were a party of 5  myself my partner and 3 visitors from abroad and given a table by the window it was very cold and informed the waitress  We were told people were leaving and we would get a table soon and our order was taken  We had finished our starters and a bottle of wine by the time we got another table  I was very disappointed with the tiny piece of overpriced salmon  ""swimming"" in some watery sauce and baby potatoes  The caesar salad my partner ordered was a few slices of chicken on enough lettuce to feed 500 rabbits  another member of our party ordered a burger which was a mediocre burger with fries which he felt were reheated   The half chicken was just that nothing to write home about  Overall I feel you have lost the run of yourselves on prices  I was recently in the South of France and restaurants I visited charged nothing like this for a similar menu and really good food   All in all it was very disappointing and I certainly wont be rushing back   Overpriced and not good food "
R0027,We love it here  Fantastic food and great staff
R0027,We ordered a burger and hake from the pre theatre menu  Burger was reasonable but the hake was not  Starters and deserts were tastey but overall the food was disappointing given the price  I could not fault the service but would not be in a rush back given the choice in the area 
R0027,We recieved excellent service  Friendly staff and quick service
R0027,We visited here on a sunday afternoon for brunch  having specifically ask for a table for two not on a row with others and on its own  the front door waitress said to me well you wont be on your own for long we will get busy  obviously this is not what I meant and I told her that I wanted a table on its own as I requested this  she eventually took us to a table for 4 with a sour face  The food was ok as we only had smoked salmon on a piece of bread with some sauce but it tasted nice  I will not return for dinner 
R0027,"We went here for a meal as we had read it was really good for coeliacs  All items on the menu are either Coeliac friendly or Coeliac Adaptable 

Service was really good  even though the restaurant was very busy 

Finally we went for the 3 course meal for 39 99  Excellent value  also the choice of a cocktail instead of a desert was great 

Highly recommend "
R0027,We went here on a high recommendation of other tourists and were disappointed  Tried Irish food as well as salads and they were nothing exciting and service was slow  despite going at an off time  I recommend trying another place
R0027,"we went valentines evening   we had booked up a month before and were told a few days before that the menu would be 50 euros a head or we could cancel  we were rushed through our meal   like they wanted our table     our two main courses    crispy pork was not crispy   when i said it was not crispy   the manager said it sometimes wasnt     the steak was very dry     
very disappointed   the couple next door complained about their monkfish not being cooked    
we love our food/and like visiting the recommended restaurants in Dublin   we wont be going back"
R0027,"We were a party of 3 work colleagues and arrived straight from work around 5 30pm   Staff are very nice but the food was not good at all   very disappointing 

Out of the 3 meals 2 were barely touched as they did not taste good at all and ingredients not up to scratch   I asked for burger well done but tbh it was too well done   

Cant understand how at that time of evening how more care was not taken with cooking 

Suffice to say will not be going back"
R0027,We were disapointed with our table which was booked two weeks in advance  In a passage 1 person at each end and 2 on one side  The table was split in two no four way conversation due to back ground noise  But the real problem was my colleague complained about his chicken main dish  it was dry and a very small portion The rest of us were were pleased with the food   He is a highly regarded manager by customers and staff  He is certainly not ignorant   which is what Manager Elaine called him twice   I am a fairly regular visitor  over the years we had this meal last Dec is was to be an annual visit for this group but we will not be back again
R0027,"We were extremely disappointed with the whole experience  Very slow service with wait staff switching off continually and long gaps where they ignored us 
The gluten free options turned out to be limited and disappointing   My salmon was not prepared properly  For the price of each dish  the food should have been exceptional and imaginative  My fish did not come with any vegetables     Wine was delicious    best part of the meal  The specialty old fashioned was unpalatable  We will not be returning "
R0027,Food was the best  definitely worth waiting for 
R0027,We were left waiting a while to be seated but once we were the service got even slower  Food was ok at best  definitely not worth waiting for  Wont be back 
R0027,"We were left waiting close to an hour for our main course after finishing our starters  we were told multiple times it will would be with us shortly to no avail  

Additionally  66 euro for 6 drinks also made it not the best experience on the night  altough many friends have given good feedback about this venue 

We could have just been unlucky on the night "
R0027,We could have just been unlucky on the night but the food was below par 
R0027,We were not informed in advance that the a la cartel menu was not available   The only menu available was a restricted Valentines menu  Food was disappointing  Overall experience very disappointing 
R0027,we were not offered the pre theater dinner menu for out 5pm booking  found the dinner expensive for what we got
R0027,"We were quite disappointed in our experience considering we had heard so much about it  We found it overpriced  small portions and not great quality  The starters   the crab salad with ""avocado"" wasnt a salad and the avocado looked and tasted like it was from a jar  The tuna starter was tasty but ridiculously small  The chicken wings were fine but again quite a small portion  The mains   filet steak was nice  duck was fine but had that same mystery ""avocado"" from the crab salad on the side  surf and turf was disappointing and the salmon was swimming  no pun intended  in this butter sauce that didnt make the dish very appealing  We decided to cut our losses and not get any desserts but had to hunt down a staff member to get our bill  We all agreed  party of 5  that we wouldnt go again but judging by the amount of people who were there I doubt theyll miss us "
R0027,We were so disappointed with this   the food was below average and the whole experience was really rushed   We had booked a table in advance and we ate off the main menu  starter and main course    The whole dining experience was complete from walking in the door to leaving the restaurant in about 45minutes   We enjoyed the first course  even though it was delivered incredibly quickly    however the food was interesting and tasted good   For the main course wed ordered rare fillet steaks   what we had was medium rare / medium and they were also quite crusty on the outside   It was a very poor experience  it was expensive and most definitely did not deliver value for money   We had two evenings in Dublin   one evening was fantastic and this just failed on every level   We wont be back 
R0027,"We were very disappointed with the food and bar service was very slow to start with  
I had rare surf and turf and it was tough 
this was a graduation dinner of our daughter and there were 5 of us 
the other thing is you had no lager except a local brew 
resturant very noisy "
R0027,Went for lunch and found the service a little slow  The food was fine  desserts amazing 
R0027,Went for romantic meal  So noisy we couldnt really talk to each other  Tables so close together that we might have as well been there as a group  Food was way too average for a recommend restaurant  Similar to a run of the mill temple bar restaurant   Wont be returning 
R0027,Went to this restaurant for a date night  Was squeezed in beside two other couples and couldnt even get out passed the tables they were so close together I wouldnt recommend
R0027,As soon as we said we had a voucher the service was horrific  I wouldnt recommend to anyone for any occasion 
R0027,Went with a group of friends   We were repeatedly called girls by the staff  jokes were made about us only wanting the wine list  chicken caesar salad came without the chicken  The food was good but terribly overpriced   3 starters  4 mains  one cheeseboard  2 bottles of wine came to 273 euro  Wont be back 
R0027,A very unhappy customer  will never frequent again 
R0027,What a disappointment  Extremely rude service by the manager  whos name I know but will try and spare what little diginity she has left  After 40mins drinks still not at table  our dinner was finished  When I questioned where our drinks were I was told by the manger that there are more important things going on in this world than my drinks being late  Appaling way for a manger to conduct herself as she made the situation a lot worse 
R0027,When booking there was a box to fill in whether it was a special event  In this case it was   very much so   a 60th birthday  But I dont know why they bother asking that question   as there nothing special done to take note of that fact  Our waitress was satisfactory  The bread they serviced on the table was cut without gloves just beside us  I have a major issue with that as I believe ALL people handling food should be wearing gloves Our starters took at least 20 mins to arrive   which I thought was a very long time  Mains were tasty but deserts were the best course of the evening  Overall   I would have to question whether or not I would go back as Id raved about this place   but it didnt match my previous experiences 
R0027,It was really noisy and when we had a hard time having a conversation  It ruined the whole experience
R0027,When we arrived at the front  we had to wait for a good 5 10 minutes before anyone decided to assist  I had a reservation  yet it didnt seem like there was a table ready for us  The waiter was being a bit rude when it came to collecting our plates after we finished eating  
R0027,Wonderful brasserie  Good food and staff 
R0027,Wonderful evening  Good food  and  great waiting staff  Looking forward to a return visit
R0027,Wonderful find  great food  great atmosphere and friend efficient service
R0027,Wonderful  Delicious food  excellent service  great cocktails and a beautiful restaurant 
R0027,"Would highly recommend  the food was delicious and very well presented  The staff were so friendly and efficient and the actual restaurant itself is very stylish and atmospheric 
My bill for 3 courses and a drink was only  Euro 35 which is great nowadays 
Toilets very clean 
Definetely be back again"
R0027,Youll get sucked in by the decor and then disappointed by the food and wine selection  Its a basic gastropub disguised as a French restaurant  �Ordered Penne Pasta with spinach and asparagus  ZERO asparagus  3 spinach leaves and TONS of green and black olives  Bad  Skip it 
R0028,1st visit  certainly did not disappoint  Great service  cool vibe  epic food  
R0028,A really nice cafe with chilled atmosphere  The staff is friendly and the coffee was very tasty 
R0028,Best Burgers in Dublin  Great Restaurant  Staff very friendly and professional 
R0028,Best sushi in Dublin  No question  Pricey  but worth it  They could be more generous w the soy sauce though 
R0028,Delicious food as always and extremely friendly and accommodating staff  One of my favourite spots in Dublin 
R0028,Driver went to wrong address also  so my main dish needed to be reheated  It can happen and driver was very apologetic  but we gave full address and very clear instructions with order to avoid this  I probably would have forgiven this if the food was any good 
R0028,Excellent food  great burger and great value  Definitely recommend to anyone passing by 
R0028,Excellent service  relaxed atmosphere really enjoyed the whole evening 10/10
R0028,Food was revolting   processed chicken   was it all bought from musgraves  NEVER going again   i was violently ill afterwards
R0028,Food was really fresh and tasty  Had a Dark Mojito cocktail and it was amazing  Staff were really friendly and helpful  Will definitely be recommending it to friends 
R0028,Found my new brunch hang out on the northside  Love their brekkie and homemade brown bread  Lattes are lush   
R0028,Had the chicken burger with pulled pork  What a delicious meal  Will absolutely be returning 
R0028,Had vouchers if id been paying full price i would have complained  A friendly hostess greeted us  and  took our vouchers  The waitress who served us was ditzy but in part due to their ridiculous ordering system We ordered a selection of starters  non alcoholic drinks  and  moved onto the mains  Took forever   She hadnt been advised we had vouchers  and  said she would have to place 2 seperate orders   one for items not on the voucher  the other for voucher items  We were only started on our starters when she came over with the mains  crowding them onto the table  i had to put some of the starter food on the same plate as main to make room  Now  the food  Starters popcorn chicken  pieces of mishapen  underseasoned chicken  in no way related to popcorn chicken  greyish lumps with a light undercooked coating like cornmeal  not crispy and overpriced at 6 95  Chicken lettuce taco   tasted delicious but in no way mexican related  overpriced at 8 95  Chicken wings   deep fried  bordering overcooked with a bare drizzle of hot sauce  The fries were tasty  and  hot  The burgers were all lukewarm with cheese not melted  and  buns stone cold  The bbq chicken burger came out wrong  and  was replaced quickly but was pathetically small  it was a half a chicken breast flattened  and  it still didnt cover the bun  There were 2 rashers on it  one was floppy  the other was shrivelled  and  hard  and  had clearly been deep fried  The bbq beef burger  again  cold  The patty was small  and  dry  The 3 onion rings on it were burnt badly  there was a teaspoon of bbq sauce  a lump of cold cheese  The bacon cheeseburger was good  the vegetarian burger was good but could have had better sauce/salad  The cocktails were tasty but would not have been happy paying full price  they were in small tumblers filled with large ice cubes  I would not go back here again  there are so many better options steps away  Whatever about poor service  if your relying on being a cool burger place you have to have good burgers 
R0028,I really love this place  Its cool and casual  but the food is great  and cheap    and the cocktails are excellent  Its really super 
R0028,Live in Scotland  made a point of coming into the city to have steamed buns and kimchi fries  Lovely service  great food  great price 
R0028,Love this spot  Great for fish  curry chips  batter burgers  late night food 
R0028,Lovely meal  Menu varied and interesting  I am on a very restrictive diet at the moment but still found plenty to choose from 
R0028,Lovely place for a takeaway woul recommend this place to anyone staff were lovely and food was delicious and not pricey
R0028,This was our first visit here and we would highly recommend this place  The food/service/ambience and staff were top quality  We arrived early for our booking but it was not seen as problem  I requested a particular type of cider which they did not have  They recommended a different type which we enjoyed  I had a falafel burger which was pa ked with flavour and very filling  We will be back as the value was really good  The interior is industrial in look  this is not  a negative as it was a friendly place with lots of tables filling up over the hour we were there  Hi gfhly recommend 
R0028,Wonderful food in an intimate setting  This place for two was amazing 
R0029,Always good service  the chips are delicious   And a massive beer selection and loads of lovely cocktails 
R0029,Booking accepted for 10am on Christmas Eve didnt open until 11am  no use to me found somewhere else with difficulty
R0029,Food was generally bland  tacos were a big let down and the poached eggs were cold  Food took 1 hour for group of 10  Friendly service and decent drinks menu  Food price is reasonable but very reflective of what you get  Would return for drink only
R0029,Gorgeous food  great service  relaxed atmosphere  and  value for money too   Was also very baby friendly for us  
R0029,Great food  the steak was perfect  The cocktails are lovely and the service was friendly  Excellent beer list and an awesome vibe  We love this place 
R0029,Great place   delicious food
R0029,Great place with excellent food and beer and friendly stuff
R0029,Great service  excellent food  will definitely be back   
R0029,Great spot for brunch  food was delicious and we stayed for 3 hours without anyone trying to move us on   Will definitely be back 
R0029,Great staff and gorgeous pub food 
R0029,I havent got a clue why anyone would eat here  Healthy food doesnt have to taste bad  Definitely NOT recommended 
R0029,Not the right place for a special occasion   rugby game on in a pub while we tried to have our special lunch  Wish we had known
R0029,Over all a grear experience and the staff were really nice
R0029,"Shambles would be a better name  Firstly the service is beyond bad and down right rude  You know you are in for a fun time when the girl behind the counter sighs and squaks ""is that all you want"" 

The pastries were average and coffee OK but a tad bitter  I wont be making a return trip "
R0029,The experience overall was good  Food was delicious 
R0029,The food was absolutely perfect  the staff were incredibly friendly and attentive  A really great evening
R0029,This place has good beer list and nice food  very noisy hard to have a chat
R0029,Very slow service and non attentive staff  Will not be returning 
R0029,We had a terrible experience there  Everyone felt sickly after their food  A piece of bacon appeared on the veg breakfast plate  There was no dressing on the salad  Service was bad mannered as well functionally inadequate  We sat looking at our dirty plates for the majority of the brunch  I would not recommend this place 
R0029,We love this place  the steak is always perfect and the cocktails are to die for  Thanks
R0029,We tried to get a meal here today  but end up hungry  First of all  very impolite waiter directed us to our table  After he took our order  he brought and served dirty knives  We made a complaint and he rolled his eyes over like it was our fault  Very rude and unprofessional behavior  Avoid this one  there are plenty more good restaurants in the neighborhood 
R0029,Wonderful food  d4inks and exceptional service  A great spot 
R0030, The last time we were here  we came in out of the rainy  windy and cold spring that were having  to an even colder and more distant welcome by a waitress who seemed more concerned about  well  nothing  There was no hello  and just a blank facial expression 
R0030,An amazing  budget meal
R0030,Arrived for lunch and ordered by 12 40 but 3 sandwiches not served until about 1 20  Waiter apologised and didnt charge for coffee but cafe needs to be ready to deal with lunch trade and get people in and out quickly  Chicken club  chef had no bacon  was not good   it was very chunky and rustic and not what I expect a club to be with layers of thin sandwich  egg etc  Sourdough was very hard when toasted so crusts inedible  Wouldnt return for food  Setting lovely so I would go for drinks or coffee only 
R0030,Bar staff could be a bit more polite   other than that  it was good 
R0030,"Everything is quite overpriced  its so expensive that they have on their menu 100 ml glasses of wine 
Avoid this place"
R0030,Excluding the woman who seated us the service was terrible 
R0030,Food was flavorless and service was below par
R0030,Food and surroundings are lovely  Service is appalling  Staff are so rude  We went to the cocktail bar after lunch and had to wait ages to be given a menu  we were ignored again before our order was finally taken  We then watched our cocktails sitting on the bar for ten minutes  Fair enough if the staff are super busy but a lot of them were standing chatting beside the drinks  We then walked over to lift them ourselves  The waiter got the hint then and begrudgingly brought them over  He then got them all mixed up so we had to figure out for ourselves which drink was which  Before we could even take a sip the same rude waiter appeared beside us with a bill and card machine grunting something about payment  Shame such poor staff let down such a lovely venue 
R0030,Food very expensive and not that tasty  Nicely refurbished place but would not return to eat 
R0030,Great food  albeit some portions were quite small  great service  great atmosphere  and  great location  Would recommend to a friend 
R0030,Hands down the best foot the dublin  excel yourselves every month  really know you got fed here 
R0030,Hi a table for 5 was a table for 4 with the fifth person stuck on the end in an aisle very uncomfortable
R0030,I booked to dine here for Sunday lunch last Sunday  I booked the last lunch booking on the app for 2 45pm  When I arrived I was seated by the door which isnt a very pleasant position and some people who came after us asked to be moved  We were seated with a different menu that was the dinner menu  When the waitress came to take our order  we told her we were going to have the sharing plates  She highly recommended the beef croquettes and we told her we hadnt seen those on the menu  She then looked at our menu and realized we didnt have the lunch menu and I queried this with her  She went to speak to management and came back and said she couldnt offer us the lunch menu as it was just going on 3 and as this was a soft opening  the kitchen wouldnt be able to cater for this  I expressed our disappointment   She then stated that they were only offering the dinner menu all day which was contradictory to what she had just told us  As it was my friends birthday  I didnt want to make an even bigger fuss and we said we would just order  We ordered 4 sharing plates with 2 sides and 2 coke zeros  Our waitress returned with 2 diet cokes and I asked had she coke zero to which she replied she didnt  The food was very average and the portions tiny   sharing plates but only 3 things per plate when they arrived which meant we had 1 and a half bits each  We ordered the duck wings were the nicest  the black pudding sausage rolls were lovely also  unfortunately the prawns were overcooked  and we also had the steak tartare which was average at best  Our sides were the fries and carbonara mac and cheese which we enjoyed  We asked for the bill which came and when I asked for the card machine  we were left sitting for 25 minutes while the waitress took card payments from a huge group sitting nearby  Eventually  the male manager noticed us sitting there and brought over a card machine  To say we were disappointed and underwhelmed is an overstatement 
R0030,I was thoroughly disappointed in the food  service and drinks  We initially ordered 2 cocktails  one came out completely watered down  I asked if they could add a little more bitters and in fairness they remade it and it was fine  When the second attempt was brought to the table the server didnt even wait to ask if it was OK  they just walked off  The food was the biggest disappointment   the tartare was soggy and flavourless  the tuna sashimi had no flavour and was tough to bite  the charred cabbage was greasy   the duck wings were OK in comparison to everything else  Its a shame after such an overhaul of the property that they arent able to bring the food up to par with the decor 
R0030,"I wouldnt go back there 

The waiter who served our table wasnt nice "
R0030,Id go back for a drink but definitely not to eat  I found the food significantly more expensive than its quality or portions merited  And the seating  at the side  just inside the front door   was wholly non atmospheric   very corridor like 
R0030,ignore previous reviews and sample for yourself  Great food  great service  great vibe  wonderful evening
R0030,It was a great atmosphere  the food was gorgeous and our server was absolutely lovely  Cant wait to go back again 
R0030,Lacking atmosphere  staff not friendly
R0030,Menu was very limited  is it tapas or not  Was very loud  restaurant was half in the bar with people constantly walking through with drinks 
R0030,My family had booked a table for 1 30 pm and when we arrived were given a Brunch menu  The Brunch menu was limited and when we asked for a lunch menu we were told there was none  The website does list a brunch menu and we were not offered a bar menu either  In the end we left as we did not find the staff very accommodating and the menu we received was quite limited  I have been here for drinks before and found it very good and so was incredibly disappointed 
R0030,Nice atmosphere for casual meal  A little overpriced for what you get 
R0030,No vegetarian option for main course  Very small selection on the starter menu for vegetarians  No vegan options at all  Very poor for a new menu 
R0030,"Not at all impressed  over priced and underwhelming  A real let down 
"
R0030,Ordered burger with no mustard and no pickle with chips and fish and chips   When the burger came it was covered in mayonnaise  which was not one of the ingredients listed on the menu  My wife hates mayo so we had to send it back   The chips were not hot  were obviously lying around and so were warm and soft   Also they were small and bitty  the worse chips of any restaurant in that area   I had finished my lunch by the time my wife received her second  correct burger  which she did not finish  She said it tasted no better than a frozen one  Very disappointing meal 
R0030,Our Burgers were raw and all our meals were cold  Service was excellent however and the staff offered a new burger and two meals were taken off the bill
R0030,Outstanding meal here for my husbands birthday  lobster burger on specials board was INSANELY good  and  amazing value  Cant wait to go back 
R0030,Really enjoyed our evening  Food was good   Service was awful   Wrong order came to our table at least five times   Never seen anything like it   Very disappointing 
R0030,"Second Visit  Went back for a second visit and what a disappointment  We ordered the burger which was dry and overcooked  and the fish which was the smallest portion served in something that looked like dishwater with one or two vegetables floating in it and nothing else   Very bad value for money   The excuse that we are only newly opened is wearing a bit thin���


1st Visit Was very excited when we saw this place  had reopened   Booked a table for Friday last   The refurb is stunning and well worth a visit   We ordered Crab in brioche  black pudding  sausage rolls and Mac n cheese all were beautiful  the mac n cheese could have been a little hotter  and we waited 30 minutes after ordering before food was brought out  even though it was not that busy   The Ladies loos were disappointing and many of them were dirty looked as if they had not been cleaned since the day before   When we got the bill We had been charged for two of the more expensive rums when I had specifically asked for the cheapest one on the menu   This was disappointing and annoying   Overall it was a very pleasant lunch very friendly and attentive staff   Booked for lunch again before leaving "
R0030,Service was very good and the atmosphere lively  We both had the beetroot and goats cheese for starter    though it could do with more goats cheese  We also both ordered the special which was striploin with fries and onion rings  I asked for my steak to be cooked medium however it was more well done and I was unable to finish it  The accompanying fries were cold  I was disappointed as the last time I ate here with family  we all had the ribeye and were all pleased with it 
R0030,Staff were very attentive and the decor is beautiful  Unfortunately the quality of food for the price was low and quite small portions  you need to order sides with your main dish   There was a leak in the roof too when I was there  Id probably recommend going in for drinks but not for food
R0030,The chicken dish was lovely  glad we ordered side orders  as the main course portions were quite small   The fish burger was not enjoyed   Service was EXTREMELY slow  even though there was barely anybody there when we arrived   we were there 1 hour before our main course arrived   Based on slow service it is not somewhere we would recommend or go again for lunch   but the food and and surroundings were lovely 
R0030,The tarter sauce was watery and not good  The blue burger was okay  Both of us had stomach cramps after eating here 
R0030,The food was served in inappropriate crockery  I had to ask the waiter for a side plate to put my mussel shells on  Why side plates are removed prior to Main courses being served is a mystery to me   Overall the food was mediocre  The presentation of my starter of beetroot was crude and the beetroot was undercooked   the accompanying goats cheese was minimal  Sea bass was tasty and cooked nicely but on top of a load of mussels and kale just did not work  The wine was unbelievably overpriced 
R0030,The initial experience was good until we got the bill  My friend asked for a slice of bread to mop up the prawn juice with her starter which cost  Euro 12  but we were then charged  Euro 5 00 extra for that slice of bread which made the meal seem very expensive  Then we agreed to leave the table to have tea/coffee at the end of the meal as they said our time was up at the table  We went into the cocktail bar  sat at a table with high  stools and the waitress fell and split  a large container of water all over myself  My clothes got wet and my bag and it contents got soaked  Only compensation was we did not have pay for the teas  Poor customer service  The least we could have been offered was a drink after what happened  Overall not a good experience  I wont be back 
R0030,The location and surroundings are amazing but the food was sub par nothing to write home about
R0030,The service was very slow and quite inattentive  There was hardly anybody in the dining room hence I wasnt impressed 
R0030,The Staf was great  Friendly and service minded  The venu was also nice  The food how ever was tasteless and really disappointing  It felt like it was cocked with out any engagement or joy 
R0030,The Steak dinner was ordered and requested medium rare Te steak was dry also it was tough It was a disappointment as a steak is not a complicated meal to get right The chicken main course was ok 
R0030,Nobody should ever have to endure this place  Really the worst food Ive ever ordered from just eat
R0030,Unfriendly and cheeky waiter  Extremely loud  The food was okay but not worth its price  As we didn�t order enough in the waiters opinion we were almost thrown out  Very disappointing   This place used to be so much better        
R0030,"Very noisy place  seems to be mainly a large city centre bar with a restaurant as an after thought  Difficult to have a conversation  

We found some cling film in our starters and the staff did apologise but were not very genuine  They took the starter off the bill  

Overpriced for what it is  should go across the road to the other restaurant "
R0030,Very popular but disappointing  Thick and greasy  Fish not fresh  �Lots of choices  Try the ones with better reviews 
R0030,Very very over priced   Euro 13 for a mouthful of a cocktail  Service amazing  Food portions very small also
R0030,"We came to have a brunch in the bar where the jazz band was playing 
Food was good and the venue is really nice  Prices are very fair for what you get 
Very nice"
R0030,We have had a chance to eat here twice during our visit  The coffee and breakfasts were great and the people very friendly  I would recommend 
R0030,Very rude and unprofessional behavior  Avoid this one if you can
R0030,"We were on our first trip to Dublin  
It had been highly recommended by Friends  and all was wonderfully brilliant 
Delicious meal with professional accommodating service 
Lovely evening "
R0030,"We were there for a company night out  which was a meal and drinks  Food was fantastic  but you have to wait a long time to get served  and for food to be prepped  
More annoying on the night was that it took between 15 20 minutes to get a drink   this is an unacceptably long time  considering the bar is 20 feet from the table  It really frustrated our party 
Also  while we were reading the menus  two small plates of sourdough bread were given to us  we thought as appetizers while we waited   seemed like the standard thing you would see elsewhere  However  after coming him I noticed on the bill that we were charged for both of those plates of bread  Was never told to us that we would be  they simply were put on the table without us asking  
Noise level was hard to take too   we were shouting at each other all night to try and be heard  even people next to you were drowned out by the overall racket 
Finally  there was a 12 5 percent tip put on the bill   infuriating  considering poor the service had been all night 
In summary   excellent food when you get it  great drinks too  but you wait an unacceptably long period of time to get either  Overall the delay in getting served ruined the experience  would not recommend and we will certainly not go again for a work event "
R0030,Where they have placed the restaurant it kind of feels like you are shoved into a corner; all the food we received was on the cold side and just not great  Though that can be forgiven as you dont really go to this type of place for the food  The service was okay  but for the kind of place it is I would expect it to be much better and for the waiters to be more attentive  but I think that is more of a personal preference 
R0030,Wonderful room  Great service good food but its noisy  Had a great dinner 
R0031,"Dinner dates here are perfect  Small cozy area and I fell in love with their design  Waiter and waitress were also really friendly 
"
R0031,Good food with good prices  Service was excellent too  Limited menu  but perfect for bites with a cocktail 
R0031,Great authentic Mexican food in Dublin of all places  I was in Spain the week before and there was nothing with the same Mexican atmosphere or food  I would say if you are looking for the closest thing that emulates proper Mexican food in UK/Ireland this is the closest you will get to it  The service was quick and friendly  and the food tastey  I got the spicy enchiladas  I felt like maybe I would have been better off with regular as these were really strong  My girlfriend got the Mexican tortas  being from Mexico she mentioned they werent 100 percent authentic  but she still gave them a 3/5 on the taste scale  Overall this place was a unique experence  and I did not expect anything like this around here  It was truly refreshing and I would gladly come back 
R0031,Great spot for breakfast  Its a tight spot  with good atmosphere  Amazing service  My wife loved her omelette  I loved my flat white 
R0031,Had a really great meal here  3 of us shared a selection of plates which were all absolutely delicious  You could really taste the high quality ingredients used  The staff couldnt have been friendlier and the vibes were perfect for a chilled Saturday night  House wine was also delicious and everything was really reasonably priced  Will be back 
R0031,Had my birthday party there and everybody loved it  The food was great and the bites/tapas size of the portions is perfect  so people can share and try different dishes  The staff was nice and very helpful  Highly recommend 
R0031,Loved everything about this place  from the food to staff  Location is a winner  best place for people watching is sitting outside with a glass of vino 
R0031,Lovely food at reasonable prices
R0031,Service was absolutely terrible on Saturday  The first drink I ordered was a Bellini which was on the menu  and I was asked Whats a Bellini   When it arrived it was flat as if the prosecco had been left open for ages  Water jug and glasses were all visibly dirty and the staff were unhappy when we asked for new ones  We had to go up to order most of the drinks ourselves as no one came near us while we were eating and they brought the sharing food down with no plates or napkins again we had go up ourselves to ask for them   Ive had lunch there before and food was good but brunch last Saturday not up to standard at all  Definitely wouldnt go again particularly with the excellent choices that are nearby 
R0031,The staff are pleasant and efficient  
R0032,They had two people working  neither of them seemed interested in even looking at the customers  They were slow  And not just normal slow  but really  really slow  There were people waiting in line after me to pay for the their food  and I image the soup they had was cold by the time they sat down  Without a doubt  I will not be going here again  The place was a mess as well  You would think one of the two people not interested in working there could have taken a minute to wipe a table or something 
R0032, Very decent place  Ive been there at lunch time with some friends  There is a 2 courses menu for 12 euros  which is very good and it has lots of options  I had the sea food paella as main and it was good  The starters are prity good as well  Totally recomend  The staff could be a bit more friendly 
R0032,A first visit  chosen on the basis of other diners positive reviews  Unfortunately this dining experience did not live up to expectations generated  The waiting staff were helpful in finding another table  having asked to be moved from the allocated table nearest the kitchen  The starters were OK but the duck leg main course was spoiled by being served on a bed of mashed potatoe  The tables are too close for comfort  the prices  are probably average for Dublin  but unfortunately nothing would tempt me to return 
R0032,Amazing food  excellent service and great vibe
R0032,"Best breakfast in Dublin  The stuff is lovely here and the prices very affordable  
We will definitely come back here "
R0032,Best value for money in Ireland  as far as were concerned  Excellent crispy duck leg  Loved the place 
R0032,Bland food  Poor service 
R0032,Booked at the last minute   I was in my own and they found me a quiet corner   The food was excellent like it is every time 
R0032,Brilliant waiting staff  Great atmosphere  Want to go back tonight  
R0032,Delightful little bistro with excellent food and service  Inside and outside seating available  This is the perfect spot to have a snack  drink  chat or even read a book 
R0032,Dinner here was superb  �Carrot Coriander soup  Chicken over risotto  and toffee pudding were all standouts 
R0032,"Disappointed with the service here  waitress seemed very distracted and uninterested  We had two courses served to us in less than 20minutes  When I go out to dinner its a treat and we like to enjoy it  I felt extremely extremely rushed and the restaurant was empty  We had the starter on our table before we had ordered our drinks   
Very disappointing "
R0032,Excellent food but this is where it stops our table was so small it could not hold two plates  a wind cooler and a bottle of wine  You should never put a table next to the stairs  Everything spoiled by the ambience  Would never go back 
R0032,Excellent  just delicious 
R0032,First time in here and enjoyed it   Ill definitely be back 
R0032,Great food and service always excellent   We even got a glass of prosceco as there was a delay with our table  Lovely night
R0032,"I dont know why people gave many bad reviews for this one but after trying  i m with many of them now  It is one of the places I feel rushed while using food 
Plus Me and my friend  we had tom yum soup and main courses from early bird menu and it did not taste good as it should  

And I dont know why but there were many flies around where we had food and I was absolutely not happy with that 

Disappointing is finally my feeling about this place "
R0032,"It wasnt great  but it wasnt awful either   We had a table upstairs  which was very warm and stuffy   They needed the air conditioning on  or at least the windows to be opened 
Our order was taken promptly and the appetisers arrived quick enough  however there was a very long wait for ours mains to arrive   They were tasty  but nothing we couldnt make at home ourselves 
We never really saw any of the staff coming upstairs to check on tables and when someone finally did  my husband ordered a second drink    but it never arrived   When our plates were cleared and dessert menus offered  we opted for the bill   The waitress scobbed "
R0032,Lovely restaurant  amazingly good food  very accommodating place and friendly Staff  They followed with me a day before to confirm the booking  I highly recommend the place to everyone 
R0032,Nice little neighborhood bistro  Food pleasant but nothing special  Service friendly but timing all over the place 
R0032,One of the better dining experiences Ive had in the D8 area in the last few years  Will be back 
R0032,Restaurant called and cancelled on the day closed fo evening problem with water    Did drive by clearly not closed I would say over booked disappointing attitude
R0032,The restaurant took booking  an hour before   then called 40 mins later and cancelled saying the kitchen was already closed   
R0032,Eat if you are dying  Otherwise stay away 
R0032,"This is a nice ""neighbourhood"" restaurant  Good value for money "
R0032,This place used to be a fab little place but its really just average now with overpriced greasy and overcooked food  Id give it a miss  There are much much better places in the neighbourhood 
R0032,Wood burning owen and really goob pizzas  Industrial decor  check out the lighting made out of copper pipes
R0032,"Your attitude tonight was very disappointing  We have booked through the app 1h30 before coming in  Never had an issue before  

The issue happened tonight   You were already closed  no one had prevent us about that  We came with a taxi to have d�ner but we have been kicked away instead 

Apparently we didnt have the ambition to work until 9:15pm in real  but in the app yes  

We were strongly recommend your restaurant  but this time is not existing anymore "
R0033," The best falafels in the city  They have varieties of falafel dishes and that to only pure vegan options  I have tried many dishes from the menu as I use to visit frequently  But my favourite is Palestinian Falafel  It has falafels fresh veggies  hummus inside a pita pocket  Another dishes which is a must try is the potatoes Wedges  Also Eggplant or smashed brinjal served cold with pita bread is a delicious and healthy option 
This places has all the healthy options with lentil soup to name a few more  A must visit for vegan foodies  "
R0033,Another cracking place to visit in Dublin  Great staff  food and menu  Always a fun experience morning  noon or night  Really love everything about this place  Do visit  you will love it 
R0033,Excellent food    very friendly service     definitely recommend  
R0033,excellent foood and service   we had 3 different burgers and salads  absolutely delicious 
R0033,"Great place for dessert  Presentation was fantastic  service was quick  ambience was enjoyable  beverages were will provisioned

They missed out on the last star because the scone was a little too much on the crunchy side for my liking  although it was still good"
R0033,I had a delicious breakfast of porridge with orange zest  pears  and walnuts and a pot of breakfast tea  �Quick and friendly service too  It filled up with people quickly  so I would get there early 
R0033,Lovely place to go for either good or drinks  Great drink promos  Menu during the day is very reasonable for food  Recommend to anyone to go here 
R0033,Nice friendly place to eat  food is really out of this world  had a great time  would recommend to anyone 
R0033,One of the best burgers I have had in a long time  Full of flavour  Highly recommend this place  Very nice setting  good service  central location
R0033,Was here on a Wed night  Seemed very busy with music  Great selection of beers  The pint of Guinness is one of the best I ever had 
R0033,We live in Dublin and go to this place about five times a year  usually for special occasions  birthdays etc and have never been disappointed   The standard of food is consistently excellent 
R0033,We went for my nieces birthday she loved the food and the staff couldnt do enough for us
R0033,We were a party of 11 on a Monday night  The restaurant was soooooo busy but we were greeted like we were the only and most valued customers  The restaurant is very homely and relaxing   Load of room between tables 
R0034,"For the price of the food  it was very tasteless and not even close to what would be on offer  in terms of quality  across the road at Eddie Rockets 

My Son wanted to go to try it out so we decided to go for a special treat for dinner  The chicken bacon and cheese burger I had was dry and the fries were greasy  oil and grease were all over the plate   

I can honestly say I wouldnt go again despite the fact that the servers were very polite and courteous  Thankfully we had a 3+ voucher because had I have paid full price for this Id have demanded a refund of some sort  

I left feeling empty  I had a full stomach  but there was no joy that I would usually associate with dining out at a restaurant  although I dont think I could use that term anymore when mentioning  "
R0034,Staff are lovely  food is gorgeous  We loved the ambience
R0034,We got seated straight away  Our server was very nice and attentive  Food was amazing 
R0035,"We brought our two boys this week during a short stay in Dublin 
Having been a fan of the restaurant in the past when I lived in Dublin  I was very disappointed  
The service was slow although the staff were very friendly and courteous  
The food was just okay  although the kids menu is well priced the main menu is highly over priced for the quality of food you get  Our burgers were dry and over cooked and to be honest tasted quite bland  
Even for our children the music was too loud  We werent able to relax at all  we just wanted to eat and get out which we did  
I was bitterly disappointed "
R0036,Amazing food will definitely be back  great service   friendly and helpful staff
R0036,Anniversary lunch party  Memorable
R0036,Booking was for 1pm  one of our party was 15 mins late but we ordered as soon as she arrived  Starters came 30 mins later  followed by mains  Steak was well done despite being ordered med rare  otherwise food was ok but an extra portion of chips took forever  As soon as mains were cleared we were told they needed the table for a big group  We still had wine to finish and werent offered dessert  They just wanted us out 
R0036,Excellent food  great ambience and excellent service  We will certainly be back again 
R0036,Excellent service  fabulous food beautifully presented  Another wonderful evening at this place 
R0036,"Food was pot tired for one stew and not heated through for the fish pie  �
�Frankly  I was disappointed
"
R0036,Great dinner and fabulous oysters 
R0036,Great place  gorgeous food and lovely staff  Highly recommend 
R0036,"No lift and had a man on a crutch with us who has mobility issues 
They tried to squash 8 of us into a table of 6  Waited 1hr 45 mins from ordering to eat and we had two children  No bread or any starter offered  
Food was good when it eventually arrived  Communication skills non existent with the staff 
Wont be returning "
R0036,"Not very impressed  �10 minutes to just getting an acknowledgement at my table  20 mins for order to come out   wrong  couldnt get server back to fix my order  no ""how is it ""  ""need anything ""  nothing      � then after waiting 10 mins to pay  I got up to leave and mysteriously a server appeared with my bill  which had the missing food from my order  � Pretty sorry ass place  � � Edit: sushi is mediocre at best "
R0036,"Ordered a delivery here at 9 on Wednesday the 13th of May 
By 11 30 the food still hadnt arrived  so I called the take out and they said that the person on the front desk had finished their shift when they took our order and they didnt put it through properly  
Would never order from here again  "
R0036,"Poor quality fish 
Tables sticky Worn varnish 
Waitress friendly"
R0036,Rushed and unattentive service  felt the waiters created a bad atmosphere  Food was just OK  we wouldnt go back 
R0036,Server was completely uninformed on the food and delivered all of our meals incorrectly   Food was very good and the place is small but comfortable 
R0036,Service was extremely slow  and  food was cold so had to be sent back  It wasnt busy at all  so no excuse for shocking service  We wont be returning 
R0036,Thank you 
R0036,The wine list was small but the two glasses we got were fine  Desert for my wife was quite bland  an unripe plumb tartlet with ice cream   It wasnt a great meal in any shape or form  but even taking everything into account above there is some potential here  Hopefully it will get better with time 
R0036,"This has been the absolute worst meal of my life   Euro 20 on ""kebabs""  Nobody should ever have to endure this place  Really the worst food Ive ever ordered from just eat  Olives and other crazy ingredients that are not advertised in the menu"
R0036,We had fabulous meal with great great server   However  although we had confirmed our booking we were not expected and that had happened to an awful lot of people   So the restaurant was fully double booked   Now it was Christmas Eve so its an important night to get things right   And it was ruined for us
R0036,"Went here for supper as a option number 1000  everything else was packed  The place was okay  I have heard that it is better for drinks than food  The service isnt that great at all they are very slow and seemed like they didnt want to answer questions about the menu  

They food menu is classic pub food cooked averagely  nothing spectacular about it and quite bland in my opinion  

If you come here  do it as a last resort like we did or for drinks after having eaten somewhere else "
R0036,Went here on a Tuesday night  Overpriced 
R0036,Worst experience at a restaurant ever  We arrived for a late night dinner and were sat immediately  waited for over 30 minutes for our server to even arrive with menus and waters  finally got our drink and food order in and continuously received incorrect drinks  After placing our food order the restaurant was already empty  the server let us know they had run out of nearly everything on the menu and had to switch some orders  After 110 minutes our food finally come out  was cold  and was not what we had been told to switch our orders too  The staff not only was not helpful with the situation but didnt care  Food was bad  service was terrible  and there was no ambiance since no one was even at the restaurant by the time our food had come out because it took that long  Would absolutely never ever recommend 
R0037,This place is amazing  The krab nachos are to die for  Limited seating but well worth the wait  The staff is friendly and it has a great atmosphere
R0037,"
The food was not great  The batter on the fish wasnt crispy enough and it also wasnt well adhered to the fillet  The cod itself was mushy  overcooked  and a little fishy tasting  Im not entirely sure it was even cod; it didnt seem flakey enough for it to be cod  The chips werent seasoned at all  but maybe they do that on purpose so you can salt them to your liking  These were some of the worst chips Ive had in Dublin  They were very soft and  like the fish  not crispy  

 It became impossible to get a hold of someone for the bill  Frustrated  we eventually walked up to the counter to pay  �The promised discount was not applied  �but we didnt say anything because we just wanted to leave  

Its worth mentioning that they were not understaffed  The restaurant was not busy  and there were plenty of servers and cooks "
R0037, I arrived in time for the early bird menu but as it was a Monday night this meant that the restaurant was very quiet   My main was the lamb shank   The portion was ample 
R0037,All tasted incredible  My personal favourite was the Ravioli and my friends was the Crab Lasagne  We also ordered a side of Chunky Chips  although delicious  they really werent needed as we were full from all the dishes  
R0037,Always great tasting and freshly made soup  Great value and kind staff  I love this place 5* Go for it  
R0037,Amazing welcome  Lovely food and good service
R0037,Amazing    
R0037,Apart from the lovely food  the service was exceptionally good and all done with a smile  Well done  
R0037,As always lovely food and wonderful staff  Deserts now on the pricy side having increased by  Euro 2 in the last 12 mont
R0037,Authentic Italian cuisine  friendly staff and owner  nice chat  high quality  And prices are reasonable for Dublin  Highly recommended 
R0037,"Enjoyed the visit to   pizza was perfect and my other guests enjoyed their meals  Wine list impressive and service very good 
Thank you all  We will call again  "
R0037,Excellent atmosphere and supreme food  Pasta was delicious and fresh 
R0037,Family dinner for Christmas  Food not good  Seated upstairs  dreadful decor  cold  2 glasses had lipstick stains  Wont be back  Only good food we had was the bruschetta
R0037,Food and staff were very good  enjoyed it  Only down fall was annoying Americans who over exaggerate everything haha    
R0037,"Food was ok  but the service was poor and the restaurant was lacking atmosphere  It was also quite run down  had to walk past dusty suitcases and dirty laundry in a back corridor to get to the bathroom  
Service left a lot to be desired  the waiters did not come near us to check in at any stage  we had white wine but werent even given an ice bucket for this 
Would not recommend "
R0037,"Good value early bird  food was not bad  
It was served quickly so it was good for getting to theatre"
R0037,Good value  Excellent service  Delicious  fresh food  Nice flavours for summer dining  Byob with no corkage fee a bonus  Highly reccomend 
R0037,Graduation party held here was good
R0037,Great food  atmosphere and all at a great price too  Will definitely visit again soon   Look forward to another night out More
R0037,Great food  The place was kind of small but the music was also great  Staff was very friendly  We noticed a lot of Uber eats picking up the whole time we were there  Very popular  Overall great place to eat 
R0037,Great pub food  something for every taste  Live music   great atmosphere  Classic Irish experience  Recommended 
R0037,Great pub with live traditional music  The food is good as well  having done a recce at lunchtime we returned for the rugby and music in the evening 
R0037,Great quality food and superb service  Such a good spot in the centre of Dublin City Centre
R0037,Great restaurant with super food and service  Will be back 
R0037,Had a blue steak  Was cold  Ask for no onions or mushrooms and it came with both  Asked for mash potatoes and didnt have it but the garlic potatoe ended up to be mash but was microwaved so was boiling hot  Fried spinach was in a pool of water  Wasnt great and wouldnt go back
R0037,Had a pre theater meal here  Service is very good  Sometimes youll have to wait outside to get in as the door was locked  Staff very friendly and welcoming 
R0037,It was outstanding  Service and food were top notch and we highly recommend it  Great experience and really good for a date night  Btw  they played classic 80s music all night  Added bonus 
R0037,Left feeling ripped off and hungry 
R0037,Loved the lasagna  Sit in the basement where the ambiance of the wine cellar is so nice 
R0037,Lovely staff  Monika is a marvel  Delicious food  always a wonderful experience 
R0037,Me and my girlfriend went here for our three year anniversary which was very special to us  We were here for the first year together and many times in between and we have always loved it and recommended it to our friends  Today was different  We came in   the waiter said table for two and we said yes we have a booking in which he didnt acknowledge  Our special occasion was dismissed  Our order was taken  The waiter went and watched his laptop during which when the food was being prepared  we could hear the noise from his laptop  the service was not good  We were disappointed with both service and the food as we always love this place  Not sure if we will go back 
R0037,Monica was awesome  Great energy and food    Bruscetta was best ever
R0037,"My friend and I decided to drop in for a 10 am brunch  We ordered the eggs benedict and it was quite possibly the worst version of that meal that Ive ever had  

The eggs were poached but were cooked so thoroughly that the yolk had become hardened  The hollandaise sauce had absolutely no taste and more than 90 percent of it had dripped onto the plate  The eggs were placed on a slice of toast that tasted like American wonder bread  The ham was the kind of thin sliced  square deli ham that you buy in packs from SuperValu for 2 euros each  The spinach was covered in grease  There was absolutely no flavor  

Im a college student and Im definitely not picky about my food  But this meal was so gross that I couldnt even eat it  even with my low standards for food and all  Maybe this place is only really known for its lunches and dinners  I dont know  I usually dont even write online reviews  but having brunch here really inspired me to share my experience   "
R0037,"Nice breakfast spot near our hotel  Fresh  and  quick  I loved the prosciutto with my eggs  �
Looked like a nice selection of light lunch offerings as well "
R0037,Nice restaurant  Excellent service and a nice gap given I between courses 
R0037,"Not great at all  not as per advertised pictures and staff not professional or particularly welcoming 
Wont be returning or recommending 
Very poor"
R0037,ONLY WANTED OUR MONEY AND DIDNT CARE  RATED IT ONE STAR WOULD REALLY RATED IT NONE 
R0037,Overall I think it is disappointing  The food is ok/nice but so overpriced for what it is and in comparison to similar standard restaurants in Dublin  The decor and service is good  I wont be back  theres too many better options  Also it was only half full on Friday night so I suspect it wont continue in its current form anyway 
R0037,"Protein pancakes are the best 
The salads are also really tasty 

Sitting space a little bit small  but you can also take away"
R0037,Really impressed by the service and attention from the staff  would defo go back
R0037,Second time coming here  food is amazing and the staff are great  Will be coming back in the near future 
R0037,Service  and  meals were Excellent   Amount of food you get for the price was amazing  Would recommend to anyone wanting a nice meal away from the pub atmosphere 
R0037,Somewhat Tacky so called italian restaurant  food is mediocre and overpriced  Would not recommend 
R0037,The combo of the incredible atmosphere  amazing 3 courses and hospitality of our host Andy made this the most memorable meal 
R0037,The restaurant is full of small flies especially within the bathroom  It should not be open until this is resolved 
R0037,Very average  Thought the chicken wings to start were particularly bad
R0037,very cosy  starters were excellent as the wine    
R0037,Very enjoyable evening  staff were super friendly and and the food was delicious 
R0037,"Very good food served by highly professional staff in lovely surroundings
Inventive use of seasonal produce
Short carefully sourced wine list
Fantastic ripe cheeses on the cheeseboard
I have eaten here several times and have never been disappointed
"
R0037,Very good  I thought the experiment overall was nice 
R0037,Very nice ambiance   great service and delicious food  The lamb shank was amazing 
R0037,"Very nice Italian style pizza  
With a wooden oven it will be perfect 

For people from Rome like me they have Cornetti as you find them in Rome bar  "
R0037,Very tasty and fresh pasta sauces and cheese   Friendly service 
R0037,Very tasty food and excellent service  Thoroughly enjoyed our visit 
R0037,We live in New Mexico and rarely eat burritos out of town because our standards are so high  But we were hungry  These were fabulous  Big  well spiced  great variety of fillings  Good for both vegetarians  yummy beans  and carnivores  Authentic 
R0037,We really enjoyed our meal the service was excellent and the food was delicious  The lady at reception was verythema friendly  We will definitely return 
R0037,"We should have left after their bartender couldnt figure out how to make a Spritz  The food we ordered was serviceable  but totally bland  Pizza tasted out of a freezer  

I booked this place because of the underground vibe  seemed like a nice place for a date night with my partner  Sadly that charm is not present in all parts of the restaurant  as the table next to the window/cash register makes you feel like youre dinning in a hallway "
R0037,We were a party of six down for the Ireland v England rugby match  The consensus view of us all was that this is an average restaurant  We also found the selling up of more expensive bottles of wine irritating   just dont do it  Have a decent stock of wine at an affordable price 
R0037,"Went here a few times and have had great nights the times I was there not that I remember much of them 

We stoped going here for a few months and then me and my boyfriend tried here last Halloween and we where told not tonight regulars only so we thought ok its Halloween Im sure most places are the same  We tried then again another night after that and where told the same thing so we wont be going back I think its a disgrace "
R0037,Filthy and unkempt staff  A bit rude and runined the experience

R0038,Absolutely stunning meals  nice atmosphere friendly staff  We really enjoyed time   Definitely will come back  Highly recommended   
R0038,Amazing coffee here   very strong which does the trick  Great ceasar bagel and very friendly staff  A bit pricy but worth it 
R0038,Booked table only to be told we had the table for 1 hour felt I was rushed as looked around to see myself been rushed
R0038,Excellent   Family friendly   Great food and service   Defo go back  
R0038,Food was very average and the service was not good 
R0038,Grand spot for lively celebrations like hen parties  The staff were lovely  Just not what you want if your focus is a traditional dining experience 
R0038,Great place for atmosphere and fresh tasty food 
R0038,Had the best night ever  So much fun  The food was gorgeous and plenty of it  The chef was so entertaining  The craic was mighty  Brilliant  A night to remember 
R0038,"HYPE live music 

ENORMOUS fish and chips 

ENDLESS alcohol selection 

5/7 perfect score "
R0038,I had a terrible experience here last week  Please if you are booking PLEASE make sure to tell them that you want Teppanyaki specifically  otherwise they will place you in a very empty basement dining room where you will be served mediocre food and hear all of the fun happening upstairs that you THOUGHT you would be enjoying but only get the pleasure of listening to  I used to be a loyal here for all of my business dinners but after a terribly embarrassing business dinner flop due to the circumstances above I will not be back 
R0038,"I had the best night with my siblings  a party of 6  in the downstairs dining room 
The staff were so attentive and great fun  The food was delish  especially the salt and chilli squid starter 
Decor was lovely  and the value for money was unreal 
Woukd highly recommend "
R0038,Im thinking this place has new owners  as it now has a new name  This place is only a shadow of what it was  Not the same place I reviewed before for service or food  Wanted to go back to my favourite Chinese place  but its long gone  Also asked for my change back twice and never got it  Overall okay food  that used to be amazing  Left a bad taste in my mouth  Very disappointed 
R0038,"Ive been here twice now and the food has failed to impress me both times  The baked potato with chili and cheese was served cold  which didnt help with how cold the restaurant was  The grilled cheese and tomato soup was decent  but the sandwich didnt have much cheese in it and they failed to mention that there would be tomatoes and onions in it  

The food alone is not the reason for a one star review; I came here with two friends of mine and the service we received was horrible  Two of three of us were ordering food while one opted out as she was not hungry  but when we placed all out items down at a table we were promptly asked to move to a smaller table as only two of us were eating  After moving to a smaller 4 person table  we were again asked to move to a two person table so that another group of three may use our table and my friend that didnt order was basically asked to leave  I was horrified by the treatment we received and immediately after we finished our food  out plates were cleaned off the table and we were asked to leave  

Ive never been treated so horribly at a restaurant and Im unsure if it was due to the fact that we were American or College students or something else completely  but I do know that I wont be returning to this place anytime soon and Ill be sure to spread the word about our treatment here "
R0038,"If you are looking for a Hen or Stag party venue  you should come here 
If you are looking for an authentic restaurant to enjoy a dinning experience  categorically  do not go here 

When I came here  they wanted to sit us in the far corner so they could get a few more covers in 
Secondly  there was a very loud large group next to us  They did not warn me when I booked 
Thirdly  they deliberately kept the bottle of sake we ordered  away from the table to try and get us to buy more drinks  This was deliberate attempt and very underhanded 
Fourthly  I was not impressed with the mediocre quality of the food 
Finally  whilst we were eating  they came out with a guitar and started playing with the food  Needless to say that I was appalled at this 

I will never go to this restaurant ever again "
R0038,Popped in for a late breakfast   delighted by the eggs  and  avacado  Colourful  healthy  and  delicious  Complimented by lemon water and a delicious coffee 
R0038,sorry guys but a huge disappointment to my Saturday night 
R0038,The food was amazing and the floor manager looked after us very well
R0038,The food was great and very fast service  The buzz was a amazing and the staff where very friendly  Good value for money  We Will definitely be back 
R0038,THE STAFF WERE VERY FRIENDLY AND WELCOMING AND THE FOOD AND ATMOSPHERE WERE BOTH TERRIFIC  VERY ENJOYABLE
R0038,There are two different restaurants here and the same staff seem to operate both  Downstairs  normal table service  is easily booked and nothing special  The teppanyaki restaurant at ground level looks much better craic 
R0038,"This is the kind of place you could lose an hour in and not realise  I love to wander around the aisles checking out all the amazing products and fresh produce on offer  You are always sure to find something unique and unusual �
Staff I have always found are friendly and well informed  I love that the butchers add herbs and flavourings to their meats   I picked up veal burgers with cocoa one day "
R0038,Very nice meal and good food  The restaurant was quite loud and crowded  but to be expected in December 
R0038,"We came here to celebrate our success  had an amazing time  Great food and staff very nice
Really recommend this place "
R0038,We love chai yo and have made it a regular visit every time we are in Dublin
R0038,We loved this restaurant  The food was delicious and very high quality  They had some local musicians that made it so  so fun  We would highly recommend it 
R0038,Would highly recommend to a friend  Wonderfully friendly and attentive staff with excellent food and added entertainment  cant go wrong  Will be back 
R0039,Anne Marie and her colleagues looked after us extremely well  all were very professional and friendly   I would highly recommend to my friends and look forward to going back again  especially for the Prawns Pil Pil   delicious 
R0039,Both my meal and my friends were extremely salty  Food was also quite slow 
R0039,Delicious food and excellent service in a lovely restaurant with waterside views of Grand Canal Dock 
R0039,"Dinner booked for 5 30   seated at 6 15  Had less than one hour to eat before we had to rush to the theatre 

Overall  very disappointed with the management and organisation  Do not book here if you have plans after dinner  No guarantee on what time you will be seated "
R0039,Disappointed  menu limited and expensive for what you got  Also had to vacate table and move to the bar to finish our drinks  Had to leave them as it was so noisy you couldnt have a conversation  Would not recommend 
R0039,"Experience spoiled by nearby table of young ladies who sadly didnt know the difference between their indoor and outdoor voices 
Service impeccable  
Main course  smoked pork  was way way overdone and dried out  
My daughters Prawns pil pil were in their shells      First time Ive ever encountered them in their shells       lazy cheffing       "
R0039,Food was tasty once it arrived  It was very busy  service was slow  Also the breeze in the door was strong  Staff very pleasant:
R0039,Foods good and waiting staff helpful but the acoustics in here are too loud to enjoy a meal here   Music was turned down but more could be done with the furnishings to improve the acoustics and make this a better dining experience   Fine for young people who talk at the top of their voices over one another  but not for the older generation 
R0039,Great family gathering  Great location  ambiance and food 
R0039,Great food and friendly sevice  with an amazing view   will definitely come back  thank you 
R0039,Great place  staff were so nice  absolutely recommend
R0039,I chose the duck and it was very dry   The brownie was delicious 
R0039,The food was alright  but uninspiring  and the service was friendly but haphazard  took a long time to get the attention of the waiting staff  and given the small size of the restaurant I found it strange   
R0039,I love this place  Food is great  staff are friendly and the views are amazing  Perfect place for Sunday lunch/bruch
R0039,It was very loud   even though the waitress first suggested shed lower the music so we might be able to hear each other speak across  she was annoyed when we followed up with her on the request 
R0039,Location  ambiance and service was very good  however  food quality was a bit disappointing 
R0039,Lovely food
R0039,"Lovely setting helped by a glorious day 
Food was very nice and staff very friendly "
R0039,Sever doesnt seem to care much  It was not busy but our dessert sits on the kitchen counter for a very long time  no one cares the bell  And ice cream melted when we got it  Location is good   But I wouldnt go back 
R0039,Staff very friendly and offered great customer service
R0039,The restaurant itself is intimate and in a great setting but the food was mediocre 
R0039,Dont waste your money on this place  order from your usual reliable take away 
R0039,"We reserved a table for 8pm
When ve arrived on time the lady told us to wait for few minutes as clients were paying  the bill and asked us to stay at bar  We wait for more than 20 minutes but nobody call us for dinner so we left the restaurant"
R0039,We waited an hour for our meal  which was particularly bad because we went for a Pre Theatre  2 meals arrived cold  all meals were far too greasy  We then waited to pay for over 15 mins  Overall really disappointing  
R0039,We went for a pre theatre meal on a Thursday and it was fine 
R0039,"We were very disappointed with the service in this restaurant before our show Les Miserable in the Grand Canal Dock The service was slow  my husband had to ask for his dessert as we paid the bill  It would be helpful if the waitress asked if we were going to a show 
Food was very pricey for what we got The soup was warm and not hot  Maybe it was just Christmas   but standards would want to improve for this restaurant to thrive "
R0039,Weve already recommended this restaurant to all our friends  Hoping we get a chance to dine here again 
R0039,Went here on Saturday night last for a few drinks with friends  It was packed and the atmosphere was buzzing  Upon reading their menu offerings on this website  decided to try it for dinner last night  When we arrived we were informed that they only food they do are pizzas  I dont understand where this site got hold of the menus they have listed above  but its nothing todo with the name 
R0039,Why  Why would anyone spend that much money on such average food  A burger on the brunch menu for 18euro  Do I get to keep the gold embellished plate  
R0040,Great food and service  Our server was very polite and attentive
R0040, PLENTY portion wise so pretty good value  
R0040, Service was extremely amazing
R0040,Amazing customer service all staff are extremely kind all food is so fresh  Love the whole place just not in the best location x
R0040,Amazing food  staff very attentive and polite  Will definitely be returning 
R0040,"Amazing food  very cosy and nice place  kind service by the owner 
Delicious food   "
R0040,based on the crab cakes and pork belly hash options we choose maybe try something else if theres a next time
R0040,Booked last minute and when we arrived the waitress didnt even welcome us but just pointed to a table  The food was good but dont go there if you want polite and courteous service  It seemed as though everything was a big effort for this person and any question she was asked was answered with sarcasm  I hope the management read this and work to make sure that this person improves her customer service skills 
R0040,"Booked table for 6 30  mains didnt arrive until 7 50
One water glass had 2 major chips in it 
Service took a long time  Starter arrrived about 20 minutes after ordering but mains were a long time after that  
Starters were also a very small portion and very expensive   Euro 7 50 for 5 vegetable spring rolls  
One main ordered was yellow curry with tofu and vegetables but there was no tofu or potatoes when it came  Server apologised  took it away then returned and said there actually were potatoes and that tofu hadnt been written on the order form as if this was a fault on our part  Server was really quite rude and short with us after this  
Surprised that boiled rice was an additional  Euro 2 charge as this was not clear on the menu  Overall  we were disappointed with our experience "
R0040,"Cosy place in the city center  ideal for a coffee and some pastries 
Sandwiches look also very good at a fair cost "
R0040,Cosy restaurant with great food and chilled atmosphere   Service fantastic 
R0040,Decent thai food in a dressed up atmosphere   Recommended if youre not that hungry and want to impress someone  like on a first date   The food quality was similar to the Thai restaurant in our old neighborhood in Brooklyn    just double the price and half the portion size 
R0040,Disappointed overall by the service  Nothing wrong with the food but plenty of good alternatives in town for this price point
R0040,Easily one of the best restaurants in Dublin  Ive eaten here three times in the last couple of years and it never disappoints  Food is superb and the service is brilliant  Really nice having the BYOB option as well
R0040,Exceelent food   quality is always good   Great service
R0040,Food was lovely but there was only one waitress working on a busy Saturday night   She seemed under pressure  slow service   But the food was very good value
R0040,Food was quick and good  The restaurant was very warm to the point that we considered leaving 
R0040,Good food and friendly staff  Would recommend restaurant  Okay price too 
R0040,"Good spot for a quick breakfast  The coffee and pastries are very good  
Head upstairs for a more quaint experience  
Our waitress was very nice  and the service was good "
R0040,great food  great service  lovely place  nothing to fault at all
R0040,Great food  Great service  Good beer  We had so much fun  and the atmosphere was super cool  All sorts of memorabilia to look at  What more could you want 
R0040,Great food  Really good seasoning and Thai flavor 
R0040,Great fresh food and a good music e g  with songs of OASIS  David Bowie beyond cliche or only traditionals  Great service 
R0040,Great location and tasty food  Really good flavors 
R0040,"Heres a brief update after the owner comment  see 1st review :
Your response highlights the exact problem I had with your restaurant and service  Pointing out time limits  and your virtual stopwatch of events  shows that you are more focused on getting customers through a process rather than providing a high level of service  

My issue  TO BE CLEAR  is not the timeline  but rather an attitude I received  Your staffs tone and behavior made it clear that my business was not welcome  I came in for a leisurely dining experience at a purported high end establishment  What I received was crude behavior from a flip and disrespectful waiter who seemed to think my presence was an interruption from his day  

Your response only exaggerates the issues displayed in my review  I was unhappy  I chose to leave  YOU  as a manager  chose to highlight and seem to think it appropriate to shame a customer by trying to point out what you perceived them ordering  

You FAILED to grasp what true service and exceptional quality is really about  It is about subtly  patience and above all  discretion  The first two qualities your staff epically failed at  The third  discretion  you have only served to further confirm my impression  

Further  I was quite anxious and excited to enjoy the menu and this visit was highly disappointing to me  Your response is a further disappointment "
R0040,"I had dinner on Friday nite with 2  friends   
a rather brash waitress   food nothing to write home about   definitely  not value for money    I would not recommend  this restaurant    "
R0040,I have heard a lot of positives about this restaurant  and maybe I expected too much  It was the attitude of the waiter that really bothered me  I walked in to an almost empty restaurant with just two other people eating  yet I was placed right on top of them in a very small alcove  I arrived at 1745   my dinner companion arrived 5 minutes later  Having given us less than 5 minutes to catch up  we were waspishly informed that if we did not order in the next 2 minutes we would forfeit the early bird 6pm cutoff   The restaurant was empty    did the ingredients suddenly go up after 6 pm  It was unnecessary and made me feel like the �poor relation  I will not go again 
R0040,I was disappointed with my experience   The service was slow and our table was not ready when we arrived  Not enough waiting staff to caterer for the clientele   It was a special occasion that turned into a mediocre dining experience 
R0040,"I wont argue about the quality of the food they serve  but the behavior of the Owner and Head chef will never make me come back to this horrible place of low life management 
Me and three of my guest headed there for an evening dinner While three of us had ordered a main course with starters and condiments  my lady friend didnt want the main course and wanted to order a starter and a side with some condiments  

The staff owner herself  refused to do so and forced us to buy the main course  When she didnt agree to it  we decided to leave and tell her that no restaurants have ever imposed such ridiculous rules 

This hurt her ego and the head chef  the Owner again  came out of the kitchen to abuse us He called us Juveniles  he told we cant afford to eat so we should go back home and eat He told us people from our country are a disgrace and we should stay at home 

I say to everyone  Again as I said their food is good  such behavior in this business is intolerable at all levels The Chef needs to learn some manners and make sure if his wife is taking the orders  she can handle some feedback and subtle opinion of the customers He aint doing us a favor by serving us food "
R0040,Ive been here a few times now  their curries are outstanding   By a mile the best Ive had in ireland 
R0040,"Looks like a lovely shop  and the staff were super friendly  but the iced almond latte I got was absolutely terrible  the espresso tastes burned and the coffee had coffee grounds in it  enough that it was constantly noticeable  

Super disappointed that I had to give this place a low review  it looks like such a sweet shop  If I was in Dublin longer Id give it another chance "
R0040,Lovely food served by friendly staff  There was 5 of us in the party and everyone was happy with the food and the service  
R0040,Nice location  Staff friendly and efficient   Food good and well priced  Nice house white 
R0040,Nice place to eat before jumping on the train   The atmosphere is historic and relax full  �They have 2 full bars and plenty of room   
R0040,Not great  had to knock to gain entry despite arriving for our 5pm table  waiter continued to mop floors  and  prep for evening ahead  no childrens menu/options  long piece of twine found in middle of spring roll  and  eyelash on plate  Good main courses  though very heavy on garlic for my personal taste  Pricey winelist  odd background music  and  uncomfortable atmosphere  Wont return
R0040,Not recommend  Ordered mozzarella sticks  chicken fajitas and cheeseburger the only thing that had a taste was the coke 
R0040,Our daughters birthday celebration everything was great
R0040,Overall good but not great experience all round  Interior is dated  needs upgrade 
R0040,Possibly the most unexpected meal I have had  Fan bloody tastic and the staff are just as good  Try the mushroom resotto 
R0040,"Prices dont reflect quality of restaurant  Paper table cloths  wine list is lacking  and dont for the life of you order the prawn toast  I honestly have had so much better at a Chinese takeaway  

The night we went it was busy and seemed understaffed  We were in a corner table and felt ignored "
R0040,Really nice food and great service  would recommend 
R0040,Review already posted on web  very disappointing and nowhere near its web image 
R0040,Shawn is amazing  this place is amazing  definitely come here  Also please feel free to make fun of the staff
R0040,"So my husband and my friends boyfriend had their meals  and my friend and I had to wait for them to cook our meals from scratch  We were hungry so we picked at the boys chips  �Not once  not twice  but three separate times we politely asked for ketchup before getting it 

My friend and I finally got our food  They told us we would get a discount for the the mistakes  

The food was not great  The batter on the fish wasnt crispy enough and it also wasnt well adhered to the fillet  The cod itself was mushy  overcooked  and a little fishy tasting  Im not entirely sure it was even cod; it didnt seem flakey enough for it to be cod  The chips werent seasoned at all  but maybe they do that on purpose so you can salt them to your liking  These were some of the worst chips Ive had in Dublin  They were very soft and  like the fish  not crispy  

 It became impossible to get a hold of someone for the bill  Frustrated  we eventually walked up to the counter to pay  �The promised discount was not applied  �but we didnt say anything because we just wanted to leave  

Its worth mentioning that they were not understaffed  The restaurant was not busy  and there were plenty of servers and cooks "
R0040,Sorry to say I was very disappointed as I have been before but it has been a few months     Spring roll starters tasteless as 6 mini ones / all pastry   Vegan stir fry also so tasteless and such bad value   My friend was very happy with their beef stir fry   The waiter was also in a serious bad mood   Both of us were happy to leave on that count 
R0040,Stopped in for lunch and the food and service was fantastic  Comfy seating and atmosphere  I recommend stopping in 
R0040,Terrible experience  took over an hour to get main dishes 
R0040,The staff were friendly and efficient   The ambience was nothing special just a room  There were eight of us dining three people had duck pancakes for starters and said it was very dry and tasteless  I had fillet of beef stir fry and the beef was very tough   Would definitely not be recommending this restaurant 
R0040,The two mains we had were really lovely but the prawn cakes for our starter we both thought were awful  They were deep fried batter with very soggy jelly like texture  not at all what we expected 
R0040,This is a tiny BYOW place near dart station  Booking is required  Food is excellent and staff are very friendly 
R0040,Very cramped space and also extremely noisy until we asked them to turn down the music  The waitress forgot our order a couple of times  which I dont mind really but she was also stone faced and unwelcoming the entire evening  The food was mostly fine  with the exception of the prawn toasts  which were really disappointing  but very  very mild and in some cases  the garlic beef stir fry  very bland all round  We enjoyed our evening anyway thanks to the company but the food  service and overall atmosphere werent appealing enough to want to return 
R0040,very nice food but a bit expensive for portion size
R0040,"Was absolutely starving on Sunday evening and ordered a meal from here  

Estimated delivery was 45 minutes  but the order took more than twice as long as was estimated  I was waiting 1 hour and 45 minutes for my food  After an hour of waiting  I called to see what the story was  The restaurant said the order had just left and was on its way  This turned out to be a lie because I live 15 minutes from them and I was left waiting another 45 minutes before the food arrived  No apology/ concession offered  

After all that the food was disappointing  The garlic naan was soggy and chewy and the saag paneer mediocre  Really wouldnt order from here again "
R0040,Was so full but couldnt stop because the food was too good   Best Thai food Ive had in ireland by a mile 
R0040,We had dinner on 14th August  the food was excellent and the service really on the ball  I would highly recommend a visit 
R0040,"Whenever I go here to the drive thru I have to check whether or not they got our order right because they have screwed it up over 5 times  One time I went here and did the usual check that everything was there in the bag  Satisfied that my box of 6 nuggets  chips and drink were there in the bag  I left and went home to eat it  When I opened the bag I realized that they had only given me 4 nuggets  �It seems that either they are being stingy  or that they cant count to six  

Only go here for drive thru if you have to  cause theyll probably get your order wrong  Youre better of going inside to order for takeaway  so youll have a chance to check that its right "
R0040,Wonderful food  cocktails and service  Top notch  Well worth a visit out from the city centre  Only a short taxi or a bus ride
R0041, Flavors were fine  but it wasnt overwhelming in terms of presentation which let it down a little  
R0041,This is one of my fave places to eat in Dublin   Unfortunately Id have to think twice about eating here again as a result 
R0041,I probably would have forgiven this if the food was any good 
R0041,Excellent for brunch   Great menu/food with a great buzz   Service was just smashing 
R0041,Food was nice  service was very slow nearly an hour before we were feed and no bread to the us over 
R0041,Found our meal very disappointing  as we have been regulars of the Ranelagh Branch   We were booked for an 8p m  which obviously did not particularly suit the the staff on the night  There was no atmosphere  quality of food was poor  I ordered Chicken Korma  the chicken very tough and rubbery  my colleague found the scallops poor also   By 9 30pm it was obvious we were the last people sitting and in the way  only offered teas/coffee s after our mains  so we felt we had no option to pay and go next door for a drink   Very disappointing  wont be back 
R0041,Friendly and tasty  Not very spacious but good for a group of friends   Soups  sandwiches  tea  coffee  
R0041,Lovely restaurant  Food was good  Service was terrible 
R0041,Low key atmosphere but terrific food  Most things made in house  including ketchup  which they called tomato relish  Big portions  very tasty food 
R0041,One of the worst nights out I can remember  Ever get the feeling youre not good enough for somewhere  �This is it  Thank God I wear shirt and tie when I go out  you really do need to dress sharply  Not complaining about a possible dress code  but if you went in wearing anything else  I think youd draw an eye or two 
R0041,Service was awful   had to flag someone down anytime we wanted drinks or to actually order food  Water was dropped off and never refilled  Never got a second round of drinks  Food was ok  nothing fantastic and chicken tasted like it had been freezer burned and then cooked  Dessert tasted spoiled and inedible   one was removed from the bill  The staff was too busy doing end of shift prep to actually wait on customers 
R0041,"Food was adequate but nothing �above average  �

Would not return "
R0041,Tasty burgers but they charge for the cheese and onion garnishes as if they were pizza topping  Asked for no tomato  got tomato  Tiny portions of fries  Dreadful service and music too loud 
R0041,The burgers were so overdone  they were black and gray  Sizzling shrimp starter was lukewarm  Pasta with shrimp and a tomato fennel sauce had red chili in it  No mention of chili on the menu and overpowered the taste of the sauce and shrimp  Sticky toffee pudding was stodgy  dry and just not very good  Was left basically uneaten and staff never asked if anything was wrong with it  While it was New Years Day and they may have been short staffed which is why we had to wave a member of staff down when we wanted something  On the plus side  goats cheese salad was good  chicken wings  and Moroccan vegetarian tagine 
R0041,"This restaurant is one of the best in Ranelagh 
Family environment and great decoration "
R0041,This was my second trip and it did not disappoint  The staff are always very friendly  the food is delicious and unique + good value for money  Thank you 
R0041,Very disappointed with everything ;service was very slow food was tasteless we had one guest that was gluten free ordered 3 starters before she could get one that had no wheat in it even though the said gluten free on menu ordered burger which cane between 2 slice of bread and burnt and tasteless ;asked for bill 3 times and when it cam they had added 2 table together waited another 15 mins and then they has added 20 percent service change to whole bill including drinks
R0041,Waiter wasnt great at all  he forgot one of the starters  was very slow bringing drinks down 
R0041,We asked for table beside window and we were so sorry we did  It was freezing  I had to wear my coat for the entire meal and couldnt relax because of the cold  Goats cheese salad starter was lovely  Chicken curry unremarkable  Other dishes were enjoyed by my companions  burger  pasta  fish 
R0041,"Well over priced and the food very pretentious no nice tastes one of my sons couldnt eat any of it 
Really really disappointed"
R0041,When we turned up the restaurant was closed for a private party and they had no knowledge of our booking  We were offered no alternative but to walk through Ranelagh and find a restaurant that had a free table  Very disappointing  Not sure I can trust this method of booking a restaurant again 
R0041,wide ranging menu options and generous portions  presentation spot on and staff were very friendly and helpful  Would definitely come back again
R0042,"
There were a number of things that quite literally left a bad taste in our mouths:

we turned up 10 minutes early and were turned away because they were still cleaning the restaurant 10 minutes before the service started  
 when we returned  we puzzled over the menus only to discover that we had been given the wrong ones  
 we both ordered the Full Irish  and it was really quite lacklustre  dry sausages  over cooked eggs  I also discovered that I had been given the order of the man on the next table  he and his partner ordered at the same time as us and only got their meal just as we were leaving  
halfway through our meal one of the staff turned the music up really loud which made having a conversation challenging and their music taste was 90s Eurotrash which was verging on comically bad  

What initially attracted us to this place was the story that the chef had been given a Michelin star but handed it back citing �theres no craic in Michelin stars but based on our experience I am not sure it was deserved in the first place 

One of the best breakfasts Ive ever had "
R0042,"Absolutely perfect 
Great food for great value  the service was great  I highly recommend  "
R0042,Amazing experience  Wonderful food and even better service 
R0042,Avoid at all costs  Kids food took 45 mins to serve  nobody came near us to explain why  Was cold when it arrived  Burger dry as a desert  pork horrible  place was quiet but service non existent  Their sister restaurants are excellent which makes this even more disappointing  Will always be busy because of the location but go next door for a proper meal;
R0042,"Ceviche of Monkfish was lukewarm   Also neither salty nor sour enough to match whats a normal ceviche  As a dining companion said  the 3 bits of monkfish looked like burst condoms  
Main of lamb rump was fine  So called baby potatoes were cold"
R0042,Dined here with co workers   I had the cured salmon and lemon  and  duke burger   The burger was not as flavorful as I would have liked 
R0042,Disappointing  Initially did not have reservation  Music too loud even though we complained  Much better options in Dublin at the moment 
R0042,Fab food  presentation and service  Pre theatre menu is incredible value  Michelin star without the pretentious vibe 
R0042,Family meal  food was really first class as was the service generally  Really like the short seasonal interesting menu and the vibe of the place
R0042,Fantastic food and good wine and great atmosphere and good service 
R0042,"Food good but service poor  Staff are not trained and definitely not professional waiting staff
They do not engage with customers
very sloppy service"
R0042,Food here was amazing and early bird brilliant value   However  the waitress messed up our order and then came over to say they were out of duck but only told us this as the main courses were being served   The reality was she had ordered the wrong meal and when she went to order the duck it was gone and she only admitted to the mistake after  after we probed a little   Everyone can make mistakes  I was a waitress when younger and made my fair share of them  but how it was handled on the night was bad   One of the party got their meal when we were finished as a result   We were offered a complimentary dessert and nobody wanted one and despite this they brought over a desert   Which we refused     The bill came and despite saying they would discount  the bill came over full price   We had to send it back and explain there should have been a reduction as promised   In the end a starter or something was removed   The point wasnt about the discount but rather an acknowledgement of the mistake and how it affected our overall experience   A complimentary drink and more of an acknowledgement by the manager on duty would have been better   I booked this meal so was very disappointed   I brought my mother here for brunch for mothers day last year and food was great but service was very slow but reserved judgement   I went with friends again for dinner in August and was impressed so felt it would be a good bet for this event this weekend   I would be reluctant to go here again mainly due to the service   As I said food and value however were outstanding   Many of the party work in tourism and agreed we would have to think twice if you were to recommend to visitors/journalists/ tour operators etc as youd be unsure of the level of service 
R0042,Food nice and staff were friendly but ordering drinks was so slow 
R0042,Food was lacking in taste and not well cooked  Menu was very disappointing and it was too loud to have any conversation at the table  Not a good value at all 
R0042,Good service  but the menu was pub food at restaurant prices   As a visitor to the city this place was disappointing 
R0042,Great bottomless brunch  great value  great food  Will return 
R0042,Great experience  food was delicious 
R0042,Great location and always room to sit  Nice pastries   Too bad they have to wrap their sambos in heaps of cellophane  Its SO not eco friendly  I asked why not fnd a more sustainable alternative and they were not very open  Said that theyd have to charge more and customers wouldnt like that  Come on if others can do without plastic  so can they  �Only 3 water jug for the whole restaurant  I took one for downstairs as didnt want to have to go back upstairs for each glass    Was taken away from our table  Understaffed too 
R0042,Great  fast  service  Excellent food  Small intimiate restaurant  Slightly overpriced is the only reason it loses a star 
R0042,Had brunch here  The food was so so and a little over priced for what you got to be honest  Its only really worth going here if you want to do the bottom less brunch which  I believe  is limited to 2 hours 
R0042,I brought my partner for his birthday  The food was great and the service was brilliant  Very friendly 
R0042,I dont believe the quality of service was adequate for the cost of the food and drinks  I would assume that the good location of the restaurant makes up for its below standard service  I would recommend it for meeting up with a friend for cocktails but not for a meal or a date 
R0042,"They no longer have a set menu  and the overall cost at the end was expensive given  and I hate the term  the current environment and the quality of the food on offer  Set menu of  Euro 18/19 for 3 courses incl  tea/coffee would be appropriate  

I will not be back in a hurry "
R0042,"I had high hopes for the meal due to the perceived status of the restaurant  Staff were welcoming and wine and starter arrived to the table quickly  starter was potentially a little too quick  which would make me query if it was freshly made   Decor and ambience of the restaurant were good also  

There was a sufficient break between the starter and the main  Unfortunately as my partner was enjoying his fillet steak he found a hair in his meal  When raised to the waiting Staff the first response was Has it been there the whole time rather than an apology  

The steak was taken away and a second steak arrived within record time which again I found strange but when my partner cut in to it the steak was rare   blue and not medium as he has requested  The steak was taken away for a second time  

When the third steak arrived my own main meal had been finished for almost 10 minutes and my partner did not feel like eating alone so he apologised to the Member of Staff  which considering he hadnt received an apology himself yet was extremely gracious of him  and explained the situation this was not the person originally managing our table  to which he received an attitude  that could be described as nothing less than haughty  as it was taken away  

The only saving grace  which stopped me requesting the Manager to complain on the spot  was the Staff Member who arranged the bill and removed the steak and the three sides we had ordered as an apology  

We were beyond disappointed with the experience  especially since I had received a call earlier in the week asking to move my reservation time as the online system had allowed me to book a time that the restaurant could not accommodate and had done so as requested without any complaint  

Although the quality of the starters and my own main were good  the issues with the steak  especially as the first was a hygiene issue  would prevent me from recommending the restaurant for any occasion "
R0042,"I thought it was very expensive for what you got nothing came with the main course you had to buy sides
Had to hand back bill twice before it was right"
R0042,"I walked in not knowing what to expect  �I was met by an overwhelmed staff servicing many families with small children  �Im not necessarily saying this as a negative  but there were just too many little kids  �Very loud  crying  screaming  running  etc   
As for my experience  the food took a while and the server didnt return to refill drinks  �So that was disappointing 
The food wasnt terrible  �Pretty much traditional American stuff  �The restaurant as a whole was pretty crammed together tight  but that seems to be the trend in Dublin 
Overall  I saw it  wont have any desire to go back  �Not that it was bad  it just wasnt THAT good "
R0042,"I was really hoping to be impressed with this place given that the atmosphere and service are absolutely fabulous   unfortunately definitely was not 

The decoration and setup inside is absolutely perfect  Small and a bit Tuscany rustic  with the tiny kitchen open to the room  friendly service  overall just a great greeting  We sat down and the guy   didnt catch his name   chatted to us about the menu  very casual  assured us they dont use microwaves or anything frozen  which had apparently been rumored on previous reviews   told us to flag him down if we needed anything 

For one  the house  red  wine was surprisingly bland  Really kind of a thin flavor  tasted almost as though it had been open for several days  just a big letdown  Granted  Im a bit picky about my wine  but for a place with such a mediterranean vibe and focus  there was just not any kind of that big  bold flavor youd expect from wines in the region  you know 

Additionally  we ordered the ""warm chicken and chorizo"" from the tapas menus and what actually came to our table was a salad   again  drizzled in the same balsamic vinegar   with a marginal amount of the chicken and chorizo 

We opted not to get dessert and left quite disenchanted overall   such a letdown after such great service and good first impression "
R0042,It just was not that great an experience and I dont expect to go back again  The decor of the place was pretty grim  dull and unappealing  The food was nothing special  Service was initially very slow at the bar where we stopped for a cocktail before dinner  but improved when we were seated  The wine selection was also similarly unimpressive  I cant think of any reason I would go back again when there are so many other great choices in the vicinity 
R0042,Its hardly anything to get excited about 
R0042,just average   Food ok   returned a mojito as was far too sweet to drink   I was offered a replacement no problem 
R0042,Lovely space and great location but not the most enjoyable lunch  We had not realised that it catered to big parties for bottomless brunch on Saturday  The restaurant was full but all big tables with a rapid turnover and the music was very loud  We were only a party of two and we not the target clientele so we selected badly  Food was good  Would not recommend for a long chatty lunch 
R0042,Lovely welcoming cafe with friendly staff  excellent service and great reasonably priced food   Would highly recommend 
R0042,Mums and daughters day out very well received  Good experience
R0042,Myself and my best friend enjoyed a very chilled Saturday brunch  The food was fantastic  We tried the two course with bottomless Bellinis and loved it  Our waitresses were most helpful and attentive  We had a quiet drink after brunch at the bar  The decor is fantastic and even though there were two hen parties present we didnt feel intruded on and didnt notice any excessive noise  I highly recommend brunch  lunch and dinner here 
R0042,Nice cozy atmosphere  Amazing food  Friendly  helpful staff  Going back next week on the last leg of our Ireland trip More
R0042,No record of our e booking  they said they could squeeze us in but would need the table back in 2 hours  Funny part of that was  the place was virtually empty  3 4 other tables seated and 8 10 empty  Whatever     food was well cooked but boring  None of us were impressed  Service was good but not worth the effort to go back  So many other choices in Dublin 
R0042,Normal standard shop  They have an ATM  which charges extra for withdrawal  Nothing much to add 
R0042,One of the worst nights out I can remember 
R0042,Pizza was definitely not what I expected  far from tasty and far from cheap 
R0042,"Poor food and poor value  Chips were over seasoned  The veggie burger   soggy bun and onions and mushrooms were slimy and didnt eat the burger 
Had bacon burger and was ok but have had a better burger which was also cheaper 
Wouldnt go back and wouldnt any of the other locations in dublin  
The food was not worth the hype"
R0042,Poor service  The staff looked like they wanted to be anywhere but there  Served cold mussels with my main dish  Side dishes were slow to arrive  had to ask for one that was left sitting on the bar  Friday night and the place was near empty and quiet  no atmosphere  Wont be back 
R0042,Poor value and service  food was well presented but  The steak I had was over cooked in parts  One of your chocolate brownie sundae had no brownie in it
R0042,Really bad service and average food at best  Had to ask for drinks multiple times and food was cold 
R0042,"Service was very slow 
20 mins waiting for desert  ordered cocktails after desert and cocktails were gone by the time desert arrived 

Christmas Voucher   3 selections for mains course were poor 

Starter and desert were excellent "
R0042,"Steaks were OK  but nothing special   Bernaise sauce was very watery 
I would certainly check out other steak houses "
R0042,Stunning food  Had a fantastic night and will certainly be back
R0042,The ambiance is wonderful and cocktails are superb  �However  Im sad to say my last visit there  Ive been 4 times now  was not pleasant  �It was obvious my friend and I had been there before because as soon as we sat down we knew which drinks we wanted to order  we were also told the kitchen was closed  �Being famished  and sitting on the patio   I went to the corner to grab a sandwich to bring back while my friend waited for the drinks  �I came back with a sandwich AND went to use the loo before the drinks arrived  �When they did  they were served in different glassware than usual and served promptly with the check which has never happened to us there before  �I asked the bartender for a knife on my way back from the restroom to cut our sandwich and he stared at me and motioned for another guy to answer me  �He reluctantly gave me a butter knife then followed me to the table to see what I was doing  which was extremely rude in my opinion   �I asked him when they close  he responded 11 and it was only 7 pm at the time  �No one ever came back to ask if we needed anything or if we wanted a second round  �I felt like they were being extremely rude collectively  several employees  not just one  �I dont think Ill be going back which is sad because I did enjoy the atmosphere but I DO NOT enjoy being treated like a second class citizen 
R0042,The bottomless brunch was a bit of a swizz as the mimosas were heavily diluted and more juice than anything else  Food wasnt very impressive and service was slow 
R0042,The food was excellent  However  the service was less than satisfactory  It was a Wednesday night  the floor was by no means busy and it took the staff lengthy times between courses  a half hour between mains and dessert before an order was even taken  and even getting anyones attention was a hard task  There were about 3/4 members of staff on too so I could not see why this was the case  A quite bit  1 hour/1 30 hour  turned into a 2 and a half hour tedious experience that  despite the quality of the food  would make it very difficult for me to return or recommend 
R0042,The meal  while fair  was slightly over priced for the quality of the meat and fish provided  Also  service left a lot to be desired  for instance the wrong order was brought to the table for several of our party members  as well as no server returning to the table throughout the meal  no water being provided when the jug was empty despite the warm weather  etc 
R0042,"The music was too loud  
Some waiters were not friendly  
Food was just just fine  Ive had better in other restaurants  
For tap water we were charged 1 50 pp  the early bird menu did not include sides  they came at an extra cost of 4  Euro each "
R0042,"The phrase ""if you dont have anything good to say  say nothing"" springs to mind     "
R0042,The selection is limited so dont go if your looking for options 
R0042,The worst service I have ever experienced  I informed the staff on 3 occasions we had somewhere to be  and  still ended up having to get up  and  ask someone to take our order   we waited 20 minutes for our wine  our starter arrived before our wine  Also I ordered the pork belly which had no crispy skin   and  also did not agree with me later on  which has never happened before  In relation to service  maybe if they spent less time looking at themselves  and  talking to each other the experience might have been better 
R0042,They forgot to put our order in and the place was half empty  So we were wondering why it was taking over an hour and then when we asked they said we forgot to place your order with the kitchen   Its a pretty simple process taking an order and giving it to the kitchen 
R0042,This place is a joke  �Dont waste ur time or money  �Horrible service and way overpriced crap  �It wont be long and this restaurant will be officially closed for good 
R0042,"This was the second time this group of 6 met for its annual get together   The food and excellent service last year brought us back fo this visit   Unfortunately the incredible noise from the piped music which necessitated diners shouting at each other thereby increasing the noise level further meant that as a get together the outing as a complete fiasco   We coudl only hear the person seated next to us which at a table for 6 is ridiculous 

We were facilitated in moving form our allocated table in the alcove with a speaker blaring in our ears but as the piped sound volume was raised through out the evening it was immaterial where we would have sat 

The managers response was that if we thought it was loud then we should be at the buffet  When one of our group complained on the way out the same managers resposne was yes we often get complaints from        We are a group in age from mid 50s to mid 60s 

We wont be back "
R0042,"Three of us had a booking on Saturday night at 8 30pm  The venue was very quiet  not much atmosphere  
My starter of pork belly was enjoyable and tasty however my friends pork belly main course was disappointing   portion size and syrupy sauce   My own main course of rib eye steak was served tepid/almost cold  the garlic butter placed on top didnt even melt  My other friend wasnt happy with her fish mains either  We were offered a free desert each or a glass of wine  which we availed of   The waitress was lovely and couldnt apologize enough but Im afraid we wont be returning again "
R0042,Tried this when they first opened up and was not impressed  Went back yesterday as my time was limited   very disappointing   I felt sick as there was so much salt I could hardly distinguish the taste of the beef from the beans etc  terrible   they shouldnt be allowed to do that  Had to throw away after few bites   they should be reported   that has to in violation of some salt content rule   yuck 
R0042,Usual Diner atmosphere for high prices  The food is way to expensive 
R0042,"Very bad experience 
We went 3 years ago and I was fantastic experience including 2 dinners and 3 breakfasts 
We invited 2 friends last Sunday 
We could not order full Irish breakfast  our friends were very disappointed  and one of our friend got a piece of hair in his hamburger 
What a pity  We love your place  We recommand the place to our friends  They came and had bad experience  So sad   
We hope this comments will help you to improve the situation "
R0042,Very disappointing  Had been before for the early bird and had been so impressed  Went for brunch this time and was incredibly disappointed  Service was average  felt very under pressure to have the bottomless brunch and to drink  the coffee machine was out of order and it was a freezing cold day hence why they were pushing us to drink  The food was average  nothing particularly impressive  Paid the bill and it took forever to get our change  Had been raving about This place previously and certainly wouldnt be rushing back at all now 
R0042,"We arrived and then stood for 5 minutes while a member of staff ignored us and tapped away at a computer screen  Only when prompted by another member of staff did they acknowledge we were there and show us to our table 

The music was so loud over our table  we couldnt hear each other  We asked them to turn it down  they did but then 10mins later they put it up higher than it had originally been and also turned the lights off 

At no point when making the booking or arriving had anyone said we needed to be finished by a particular time  The desserts had just been served when a member of staff came over  handed us the bill and told us we had 5 minutes to leave  At this point we had only been in the restaurant for an hour and forty minutes  Wed have been happy to be finished much earlier but the main courses took ages to arrive 

Between the terrible ambiance and incredibly rude member of staff  I would never go there again  I would so far as to say I would make sure any of our friends know not to dine there "
R0042,"We were rushed to order as soon as we arrived  3 of 6 people in our party received the wrong order  The food was very poor and nothing like what was described on the menu  I ordered ""Crispy Buttermilk Chicken on a Belgium Waffle with Secret Slaw""  It was nothing more than 3 dry chicken tenders on a waffle with maple syrup  Not worth anything like  Euro 40 pp  I could never recommend the brunch here to anyone"
R0042,We were told we were not allowed to wait until after we received our starters to decide on our mains  Rudely  The manager explained patronizingly that tables were scheduled for two hour cycles as the reason  We assured him we would be done within that window  What restaurant speaks to patrons this way  And as if we did not understand the restaurant business model  As it turned out  it was the fault of the kitchen being extremely slow  as well as the service  Very unprofessional in treatment and management style    we will not return 
R0042,While I really liked the atmosphere and the interior of the restaurant  the food was sub standard  We were waiting 55 minutes for our food to arrive  The manager brought around complimentary nibbles but it seemed as though this was a regular occurrence  When the food did arrive all of the steaks were massively overdone compared with what we had requested  I would go so far as to say it was the worst steak I have eaten in a very long time  To sum it up  nice restaurant but poor food 
R0042,Worst dining out experience in long time  Hadnt been here for few years  We were In Temple Bar area on June bank hol Sunday and I suggested we eat there   Big mistake     We all ordered the burgers and asked for them to be cooked as �medium � as possible   I ordered with no bun   After an unacceptable wait time      My cremated shrivelled  up excuse for a burger arrived on a plate with none of the listed trimmings and absolutely nothing else on plate        I was shocked instantly at its unappetizing appearance   The other burgers arrived with bun and all the trimmings but were apparently dried up and over cooked     I called the waiter and showed him my plate and asked if he thought that it was acceptable to serve a plate like that    he agreed it didnt look good and offered to change it   I told him to bring me a side salad as I was now too hungry to await any further  the chef came to talk to us and we gave him our overview of his delivery of our food  He apologized    We paid and left   disaster    
R0042,"Your absolutely right I live in Glasnevin and get told that aswel  and I said to the gentleman that how am I meant to be a regular if you wont let me in to become on  

They need to respect people who try to get in that dont cause trouble and that have money to spend    

Very discouraging"
R0043, Hmmm  I was a big fan of this place but not so much after this meal  though that could well be because of my parents poor ordering skills  I unfortunately had a sweet chilli prawn stir fry which was mostly onions and green beans with prawns  The green curry was as expected  not a wow  Dad went for the coconut soup too which was comfort soup at its finest 
R0043,Amazing food  relaxed atmosphere and lovely staff which made the day extra special  Would definitely recommend a visit
R0043,Amazing place for breakfast in Dublin  Friendly staff and quick service  Food was brilliant and a really good price  Would really reccomend
R0043,As the restaurant cancelled our reservation for 8 just 40 mins before the time we had booked I cant really review on this occasion 
R0043,Beautiful Setting with views of the hills  Food was beautifully presented and great taste  Would recommend this as a real treat for a special occasion
R0043,"I went here with some friends for a birthday   I wasnt impressed  The food was average  the service was slow and the staff werent very helpful  

I figured that because people are always talking about it  that it must be great but I guess it just wasnt for me "
R0043,Its a pricey cocktail at  Euro 11 but I was super excited to have another one  The presentation is great but this time  the taste was just incredibly sweet   to the point it was undrinkable  I actually considered going to the bar to ask them to make me another one but then just decided to ditch it  So yeh  the cocktail was disappointing
R0043,The service was awful no one knew what they were supposed to be doing  There was clearly no direction and its such a shame as it has so much potential  No background music  no atmosphere  If the room is too hot open a window common sense should always prevail in these circumstances  The food was so good which is such a pitty as it was let down by everything else 
R0043,We came here for Fathers Day so were given the set menu  Euro 29 95 for 3 courses  We probably should have been suspicious when the place was empty at 4pm on Fathers Day  The starters were tiny  the caprese salad consisted of 4 tiny pieces of mozzarella cheese and 1 cherry tomato divided in 4   We laughed it off and expected more from the main course  Unfortunately this too was seriously lacking  Most of us ordered the lamb which came out as one  small  single cutlet and a tablespoon of mashed potato and some green veg  My husband asked for extra veg only to be told they had none  The babys food then arrived and her chicken and veg was honestly bigger than our mains  The staff were really nice however I suspect they realised how bad the meal was as they didnt come near us for ages  When the desserts arrived we wished wed saved the extra  Euro 5 and left it as a 2 course set menu  I expected a lot more from this place and was sorely disappointed  We paid our bill but my husband complained to the manager after  To be fair he offered to make it up to us but we said not to bother we wouldnt be going again 
R0043,We had the Christmas menu which was excellent  Staff very friendly and Service was brilliant  Will definitely be back 
R0044, Well  not all bothered to complaint and now I am reading the reviews on other websites  no wonder most reviews are very negative  
R0044,"Booked a table to arrive at the door at 4pm and stand there in the Cold for 20 mins until a man came along to tell us it was closed for a childrens disco  
He then contradicted me that he emailed me to cancel my booking instead of just admitting that he didnt  
Another couple standing in the Cold with us also didnt get an email cancelling "
R0044,Fabulous food  great venue  friendly   highly recommended
R0044,Dishes were dirty and even chipped 
R0044,"I was disgusted with my experience in this restraunt i booked a table 4 a disabled person as ive just had spinal surgery a few weeks ago and it was my 1st time out of hospital and my last they have put me off as my mood was bad before and now im a wreck 1st no tables fo disabled persons as the lift was broken i had to TRY get out of my wheel chair which put me in AGONY for the night and CLIMB up on to a high couch why they did not say the lift was broken was beyond me when booking then when I thought it could not get any worse I needed the toilet oh my goodness it was out of order I was told NOT so nicely by a waitress and when asked to sparked to the manager she acted ""suprised"" which was so  fake my kids can lie better it was pathetic it was supposed to be conveniently fixed the day prior to my arrival and then if I thought this was not bad enough she had the cheek to offer to get 2 men to lift me up the stairs  in front of all of 2 tables that were full  but I wanted the ground to swallow me up I have NEVER been made feel so low about myself or my disability as this lady did in all my life I am utterly DISGUSTED at the treatment to be honest she did not charge 4 the coffee which was included in my voucher I might add but not the Irish coffee my partner had never shall I return there VERY UNPROFESSIONAL as for the food OMG the starter yes delicious the main chicken my son of 15 yrs can cook better it was severely bland and as for shop bought chips REALLY come on thanx for making me not want to got out again and it was my 1st visit out after surgery a appreciate this"
R0044,"Im very tolerant of Chinese buffet food  �And Im also a fan of what most call Americanised chinese food  This place falls sway far below either of these  �On an up note  the staff is very friendly  �Otherwise the food is horrible 
Avoid this place  "
R0044,Lovely table reserved  Fabulous food 
R0044,Open table took a reservation for Christmas dinner  but the restaurant was closed
R0044,Place was horrible
R0044,"the request came back wrong  I ordered a BOX chicken kebab with feathered garlic sauce 
It is spicy and I ordered just with garlic sauce 
and tried to charge me 20  Euro  for an order of 10  Euro  
I contacted WhatsApp and they did not respond  "
R0044,The rice and fish quality is basic  Both times Ive one here its been served up with a cut of white fish that had a rank aftertaste  and the second time they served a shrimp nigiri where the single piece of shrimp meat was substituted for two of the sickliest  slimiest prawns imaginable lying limply on a bed of rice  I really should have just thrown it away because it made me feel physically nauseous for the rest of the meal 
R0045, I went here before Christmas with my family   After hearing rave reviews I was really looking  forward to dinner   We were seated in a booth on the ground floor which I found really cramped   We noticed to our left there was a small table with 6 seats at it  Getting 4 seated comfortably at the table would have been a challenge  Theres an open kitchen too   Maybe some people like that   I dont know   But couple that with the music played to cover that I couldnt hear my brother beside me let alone my mam across the table   The food   in fairness   was good   I had the mushrooms on toast to start and the steak as a main   Wont complain about the food  But having ordered the 8oz strip only to get the most expensive fillet steak I was a bit annoyed but I was hungry and I was hardly going to send back a perfectly cooked fillet steak   again   food was not the issue  The main issues I had were the loud music trying to cover the noise of an open kitchen and being CONSTANTLY reminded that they needed the table back by 8  I was told when I made the reservation  again confirming the reservation and again when I arrived   I know Christmas is a busy time  I knew when you wanted the table back  Im not a goldfish  Besides  It really depended on how fast you could get the food out to one of the two tables taken in the restaurant  not how fast 3 people can eat two course  Left by 7:15 just to avoid being reminded  So in all: Bad atmosphere  cramped  great food  staff got orders wrong and wont let you forget when youve to leave by  Wont be back 
R0045,Another lovely meal in one of my favourite Dubln Restuarants  This place never dissapoints 
R0045,"Being in the mood for pizza  decided to go to this place  I regret it  All those calories for such horrible pizza  Why oh why didnt I take it back and ask for the money back or just throw it in the bin and eat the salad I should have had in the first place  It was tasteless  dry and the crust had a strange texture or something  Not pleasing at all  

Ive had from other locations and its always been ok  In fact this location used to be ok  as years ago when I worked in the area we used to go here for the lunch deal almost every friday  

Its karma for not eating my spinach salad that I was suposed to "
R0045,Consistently great food and atmosphere here 
R0045,Eaten here several time and always loved it but on this last occasion both the starter and main were very bland 
R0045,Fabulous venue for our celebrity dinner really enjoyed the experience elhave recommended  and  will be back 
R0045,Fantastic meal and atmosphere  Will be back again soon  
R0045,Food was fabulous  We each had something different and all throughly enjoyed  Also the sticky pudding was sooo delicious  
R0045,Food was good but not a big selection and probably overpriced  Service was awful  Left 15  20 minutes waiting for drinks order  ordered non alcoholic wine only to be told after waiting that it wasnt cold  The restaurant is understaffed  only 2 toilets for the entire restaurant which meant long queues  Unfortunately we were very disappointed by our visit 
R0045,Food was good  terrible service  not slow or rude or anything  its just there was a few revellers down for cure on the particular Sunday morning I was there  The staff  irresponsibly  served them wine  They were really old and unruly  and ended up smashing glass  My friend complained and they didnt even offer to take the coffees off the bill 
R0045,Great food  great staff  great evening  Highly recommend 
R0045,Great lunch with fantastic service  We went for my husbands bday and they spoiled us  Would definitely go back
R0045,Great spot with great food and wonderful staff  love it 
R0045,None of my family enjoyed our meals and really only picked at it  �Server could careless about you and we couldve walked out without paying if we werent honest people  thats how little attention the server paid to us
R0045,I know this is drunk food but man  this is the first place I left drunk and upset  Seriously the least  grade food for double the price  I ordered a chicken kabob thinking I would get sliced chicken from the skewer  instead I got a frozen breaded patty that tasted awful  I dont care how wasted you are vomit or save your money avoid this place 
R0045,I thought this bar was overcrowded and unenjoyable  The toilets were disgusting  only one out of five toilets worked 
R0045,I went there quite a few times between 2016 and 2017  At that time  food was always tasty and price was reasonable  Having not gone there for 1 5 years  it surprised me how much the price has gone up and the qualify of food has gone down  Both the yellowfin tuna and the pork we ordered was overly SALTY  Never had that issue before  I was not very happy with it 
R0045,"Id recommend it for food but I really found the service bad and not attentive to taking our order 
We were waiting over 10 mins before someone came to our table with menus  Our pre dinner drink came with our starter   The experiences was a disappointing and I wont be rushing back  
Food was good but customer service need addressing  "
R0045,In the past it has been a favourite  However  after the last visit I would not go back  We were rushed and not made feel particularly welcome   The salmon starter wasnt even a full slice and carrots were used to bulk it up   The rest of the early bird menu was equally poor 
R0045,"Its a good spot in town for a casual drink/dinner   The starters are really good  
A good variety of wines and lovely desserts "
R0045,Its been over half an hour and still waiting on food  customer service very bad and when we asked when our food will be ready the waiter just shrugged us off and walked away  
R0045,Love the food in this restaurant  it never disappoints  liked being able to bring my own bottle of wine and not being charged corkage is a bonus 
R0045,Love the staff  service and food  Its one of my favorite spots in Dublin 
R0045,"Staff were unattentive  it felt very under staffed 
Service was slow"
R0045,suits a couple on a romantic night out or a group of 4 or 6   Lovely food and excellent service
R0045,The atmosphere and service were nice  as were the cocktail and glass of wine we had  The food was really disappointing though  We got the fish salad which was so bland it could have been bought from a supermarket  The starter glavadlax and croquettes were both so boring and not flavoursome  The steak was pleasant but not very exciting either  Very bad value for money I have to say 
R0045,The experience overall was disappointing The portion size of the main was small despite the price  The service was poor  No offer to refill our water which was empty  no offer to see the desert menu or if tea or coffee after the main  Slow  poor service  Will not be returning
R0045,The food was delicious  The specials were very reasonably priced  And the service was great  A lovely night 
R0045,The price of a glass of wine was way too expensive   Euro 10 for a glass of rose is over the top 
R0045,The staff werent attencious at all  we had to wait for a long time until someone show up and serve us  even to ask for the dessert menu was a long wait  The restaurant was empty  The food is good but overpriced and not many options on the menu  It was shocking to see how little options you had  6  
R0045,"Unfortunately we felt it was extremely over priced and the steak was not cooked properly  
Overall food was so so but the staff were polite and friendly "
R0045,very nice place in a very very busy part of town  staff was very nice
R0046,Absolutely recommend this place   Phenomenal food  cool atmosphere  beautiful interior   The pre theatre menu is worth every penny   Will definitely be back 
R0046,As a Dubliner Ive tried many places for breakfast but this is by far the best  Excellent value too and lovely atmosphere 
R0046,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday  Had a table booked   tried to book for 1pm which wasnt possible but managed to get a table for 12:45 for 90 mins  When we got there though there were a lot of empty tables dotted around   they must do this to facilitate walk ins  
I love the feel of this place  The tables are well spaced and you definitely feel like you can have a private conversation  
The staff are super nice   efficient and welcoming  
I tried one of their detox drinks   In Bits  Rosemary  cucumber  black pepper  apple juice and ginger syrup over ice  really refreshing 
Food I chose the birdwich which comes with disco fries  I swapped those for my other halfs sweet potato fries   
The birdwich is fried chicken with jalape�o white cabbage coleslaw and melty Swiss cheese  Super yum  
Ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio   which was OK  Went nicely with my food anyhow  
I ordered an Americano and for dessert we shared the donuts which come with marshmallow and Nutella dipping sauce  The donuts were warm and had a lovey custard inside  So fresh  sooo good  
Definitely try here for brunch  Will have to try a return visit for dinner   "
R0046,"Chicken wings were a little short on crispy 
Service was good  Nice staff and decor 
Priced pretty well "
R0046,Exceptional start to finish  Food  service  interior  cocktails  everything 
R0046,Food was absolutely unreal  staff were so friendly and helpful and made our experience so nice  Really enjoyed it and will definitely be coming back  
R0046,Food was great  service was very slow  Had to constantly ask for more water  and took an age to bring the card machine when the bill was brought 
R0046,Great food in a great location reasonably priced  Couldnt ask for more 
R0046,Great food  friendly service  Pre theatre menu is excellent value 
R0046,"Had high hopes   Thought this was only ok

Needs to decide if its pitching casual and low key or more up market

A cloakroom would help

Starter and main both suffered from being under the heat lamp too long   a  small  portion of hake was dessicated 

There is potential here but needs some work"
R0046,"The sauce was soy sauce  Beyond disappointing 

I really wanted to love this place  I was genuinely so excited  But unless I hear good reviews from others in the coming months  I wont be returning "
R0046,I already have and Im planning my next visit  Thank you 
R0046,"I had been to this place in October and I had a good experience but not this time  The starter goats cheese salad was very nice  The hake was utterly disappointing  It did not smell good; even the guy at the table beside ours commented  It was also over salted  However  it was readily replaced 
I think the wine list is not well laid out and is over priced 
The service was polite  Overall  my friend  and I were disappointed "
R0046,I love this place  The food is great quality and value  The staff are lovely and they make great cocktails 
R0046,I was very disappointed with the presentation and quality of the food  The chicken dish I ordered sounded lovely on the menu and was to be served with sweet potatoes and corn The chicken resembled athe contents of a snack box  there were two tiny  raw pieces of sweet potato that were a joke and dry  cold pieces of sweet corn that were inedible It was an insult to serve this to a paying customer My son had the same dish and his was exactly the same My starter of calamari was tasty though as was my husbands Dock  though accompanied by tiny veg portions This restaurant will be busy before Christmas but if it doesnt serve better food it will not survive Major disappointment
R0046,Incredible vegetarian risotto
R0046,Lovely food  service and ambiance  I would highly recommend for any occasion  Also really delicious vegetarian options
R0046,Lovely spot for a beautiful sunny day  They also have the best steakhouse and so yummy bugger  Cant wait to go back 
R0046,Our first visit   We enjoyed the whole experience  Food was good and staff friendly and welcoming  Will be back soon 
R0046,Our server was not very helpful or friendly when we asked for recommendations from the dinner menu  The food was the main problem  Excited to see so many veggies and halloumi in a salad  we ordered one to share but were discouraged by the server  My friend ordered it as her main and it lacked all flavor 
R0046,Our server was friendly and helpful and our meals were delicious  The pork belly small plate was one of the best things we ate in Dublin 
R0046,Perfect ambience service and food  Girlfriend and I came for a last meal in Dublin and as always excellent
R0046,Such a shame  the decor and staff were great  the food was really poor  flavour was bland and not seasoned  one out of four of us enjoyed the meal  wont be returning after one visit sadly
R0046,Tasting menu was fantastic showcase of the quality food on offer   Yellow fin tuna dish particularly outstanding 
R0046,The food was outstanding  albeit a little experience  Other than that  it is a great experience 
R0046,Top food  top ambiance  amazing service  Well run ship
R0046,We often come here during the weekends and have always been happy with the friendly staff and tasty food  This restaurant is BYO which is great
R0046,We were there nice an early so was quiet  service was exceptional   food beautiful great value for money
R0046,Went for pre theatre menu and service and food were excellent 
R0046,What an amazing place the food was fantastic great service  A little bit noisy but i could overlook that for the fab food  Will be back
R0047,Amazing food  service and ambience  will most definitely be back
R0047,As always a tremendous experience
R0047,Excellent   cant wait to go again   Best meal I have had in Dublin this year   Highly recommend the cheese  perfect end to the meal 
R0047,Fabulous evening  Lovely food beautifully presented  Good service

R0047,What a classy   peaceful   creative meal with wonderful service   Highly recommend
R0047,A little pricy compared to other Dublin restaurants  but food  service and ambiance were wonderful 
R0047,A perfekt evening  After or before the Dinner you must try a Cocktail at the Sitting room 
R0047,A very nice character restaurant  convenient for where we were staying
R0047,Absolutely fab food with exceptional service  Well done 
R0047,Absolutely fantastic meal   bravo to all the staff 
R0047,Absolutely loved this place  Was in Dublin for a few days from LOS Angeles and ate here several times  The Veggie breakfast is delicious  And the staff is super cool as well 
R0047,Adore everything about this place  The window seat is romance epitomised

R0047,Amazing food  great service  special place  Warmly recommended 
R0047,"Amazing food  lovely ambiance  and  great service  
My favourite in Dublin alongside Forest Avenue"
R0047,Amazing place  All wine over  Euro 30 surely they could source a good house white  and  red 
R0047,Amazing restaurant; cant wait to return next time we are in Dublin 
R0047,Amazing  amazing food  thanks for such a great night 
R0047,Amazingly delicious modern Irish cuisine we are already looking forward to our next visit 
R0047,An excellent meal and all round experience  including the attentive but low key friendly service 
R0047,Arguably the best plate of food in Dublin at present 
R0047,As always  great food  great wine  great service  super venue 
R0047,"Authentic pizza made with a sense of originality and taste 
I found the base to be of excellent quality and topping didnt disappoint   
Informal and relaxing surroundings"
R0047,Beautiful space  thoughtful food  stylish presentation  lovely staff 
R0047,Been twice before  for me and my partner we felt that the food was not as good as before  The staff seemed a little rude to be honest  The restaurant seems to be on a wave of being too comfortable 
R0047,Best meal I have had in a long time  Food was packed with flavour and we had a beautiful window seat  I will certainly be back soon 
R0047,Best meal in Ireland bar none  Inventive combinations perfectly prepared and lovely  service 
R0047,Birthday  Food was amazing  service was even better  Would recommend to anyone in Dublin 
R0047,Breakfast is to die for  so yummy and moreish  The coffee is lovely also  and the hot chocolate with the cute designs were great 
R0047,"Claimed to be closed at ~10p despite many diners and still having food in the buffet 

Showed up at 9:55p with family after a late arrival at Dublin airport  We chose the place because we believed that we could get food in front of the kids quickly; instead  we were told that they were closed 

Disappointing "
R0047,Couldnt fault it  Amazing service  food and atmosphere  Highly recommended 
R0047,Delicious eats in a fun old setting
R0047,Delicious food and friendly and professional staff
R0047,Delicious food and great wine with friendly service  What more could you ask for 
R0047,Dont waste your time on this place  We got there at 6:00 and the place was half empty  The hostess grabbed some menus and went to seat us when a very unfriendly management lady told us that they had reservations coming in 30 minutes so we couldnt be accommodated  Completely unfriendly and not in the least bit service oriented  The unfriendly attitude ruined the last night we spent in Ireland but we are so glad we didnt spend any hard earned vacation money in a place like this 
R0047,Dont understand how this place has good reviews  Prawn tacos were awful  zero flavor with canned salsa and half cooked shrimp  Service was non existent 
R0047,"Dreadful experience  Food was fine but the visit was awful  Service was aggressive and we were told to order dessert and coffee before the machine was turned off  
The bill was thrown at us 
Sent a Private mail to the restaurant to give them a chance to make amends but they were not interested "
R0047,Sent a Private mail to the restaurant to give them a chance to make amends but they were not interested 
R0047,Duck not a composed dish  a collection of ingredients   Fish was heavily salted   drank a pitcher of water as accompaniment   When waitstaff informed  no concrete action taken 
R0047,Enjoyed every aspect will be back 
R0047,Even if it is New Cuisine  there should be options for gluten issues  lactose  etc  There is no option of them at all 
R0047,Everything was great  Will come back
R0047,Everything was perfect  Flawless  effortless service which looked to be carried out at ease  Food and wine were phenomenal 
R0047,Everything was perfectly cooked  best steak we have ever had  Staff was perfect and nice  One of our best experience in Dublin 
R0047,"Excellent atmosphere friendly staff and amazing food     check this place out     
I cant post this without 100 characters "
R0047,"Excellent dining experience 
Contemporary Irish Food 
Reasonably priced and great service 
Highly recommend to friends and family"
R0047,Excellent dining experience  Highly recommend the smoked salmon starter and the hake main course  Friends had lamb and thought it was excellent  The cheesecake for dessert was a hit as well  Lovely atmosphere and friendly but not overbearing service  That was  my second visit and Ill be back for sure  
R0047,Excellent food
R0047,Excellent food a perfect service loved it there will recommend

R0047,For me  this is a gem of a restaurant  hidden in a dublin   It exudes stylish comfort 
R0047,"Friendly service   prompt but not too fast  
Menu small but fine to choose from "
R0047,Great as always 
R0047,Great atmosphere  the food was unique and very flavorful  Service was friendly and attentive  We all enjoyed it and would definitely recommend 
R0047,Great food and fab atmosphere  We will come back again
R0047,Great food and lovely room  On current form one of the best restaurants in the city  A gem
R0047,Need to change front of house  before Id return  
R0047,Great food and very pleasant service at table but Front of house on arrival was Would We arrived 15mins early to enjoy a drink in bar upstairs   tried to rush us to our table   told we couldnt go to bar then when we said well have a look told couldnt have a drink standing   Seats empty but  were refused a drink   Never had such an unpleasant experience on arrival anywhere we went to another bar for aperitif and returned  for dinner which was great
R0047,Great food with excellent service  Very enjoyable experience here 
R0047,Great food  atmosphere and service   I loved it   I highly recommend this restaurant 
R0047,Great food  atmosphere and service  Never disappoints  Will definitely be back  Thank you 
R0047,Great food  really friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere  Great night
R0047,Great night great service great food will be back and will be sure to recommend
R0047,Had a fabulous meal for 4 on a busy Saturday night  Staff service excellent and friendly and food very well presented and tasty  Would highly recommend and definitely return 
R0047,Had the most wonderful dinner Saturday night   Beautiful food and great service 
R0047,Home smoked salmon with home made Irish brown bread was bested only by the attentive service  Loved the food  gin lavender cocktails  ambiance  and the private front booth  Highly recommend if you are looking for a nice dinner 
R0047,Hugely disappointing experience   Her snide  unhelpful manner is the sole reason we will not return nor recommend this restaurant within our social or work groups  Such a shame that behavior like this is acceptable in a good restaurant which is at the above average price point 
R0047,Food was good and inventive  seated by window snug which has zero atmosphere but the service from our waitress was simply appalling 
R0047,I had heard such good things about this place but unfortunately our experience was not a positive one   it felt like the waiter forgot about us   we had to remind him to bring our wine  the dessert menu  and just felt all round neglected for the full service  the food was disappointing at best for what I would expect for the price point and the restaurant itself was so cold I had to put my coat back on 
R0047,It felt like the waiter forgot about us   we had to remind him to bring our wine
R0047,I had wanted to go to this place for a long time but was left disappointed by the food  The menu was very limited and what we ordered wasnt anything to write home about  We had the special for two which had a  Euro 9 supplement per person  It was more expensive than I anticipated  a normal sized wine glass was c   Euro 10  Small can of beer was  Euro 7  a 100 percent mark up I would imagine   You can get better food at better value in Dublin 
R0047,Ambience was good  though I couldnt understand why I found it hard to book a table  booked this weeks in advance  the restaurant wasnt full 
R0047,"I have been here several times and loved both the loacation and the food every time  it was my favourite restaurant in Dublin  I booked it again for a family meal to celebrate my fathers retirement 

I was very disappointed on this visit  While the food was fantastic as always  the service was not  Our waitress was very abrupt and we felt like we were an inconvenience to her  She was always in a rush and got frustrated if we didnt give very snappy  quick orders etc  It would have been nice if she could have smiled and made us feel welcome there  Several people at the table commented on her attitude and unfortunately it impacted our enjoyment of the night  Also  it was very hard to get the waitresses attention to order more drinks throughout the meal which was frustrating "

R0047,"I highly recommend this place for discriminating diners who want it all: tasty inventive cuisine artfully presented  a lovely wine list  good service and a beautiful room to enjoy it all in  
The menu is small but there is something for everyone  We are pescatarian/vegetarians and found two appetizers and two entrees and sides   Its a bit off the beaten track in a neighborhood that is obviously undergoing rapid gentrification   The entire meal is emblazoned
in my memory "
R0047,"I was so disappointed with my meal here as I had been wanting to go for years  I emailed the restaurant privately with my complaint as I always prefer to do this instead of posting a negative review in a public forum  but two weeks on they havent even acknowledged my email  which further illustrates how little they value customers and their experiences 

The service was brusque and at times rude  No one made us feel welcome or showed any genuine hospitality  Waitresses stood over us when we werent ordering quickly enough  dishes were put down without a smile  I expected a lot better from a restaurant in this price bracket 

The worst bit of service I have encountered in a long time was when we couldnt decide between two bottles of wine  and as both were being served by the glass I asked if we could try a tiny sip of each before we made our decision  I was told no we dont do that  I explained that I work in wine and genuinely wanted to order something we would enjoy  again I was told no  I ended up asking for their sommelier  then on learning they didnt have one  their manager  and eventually she relented  after rolling her eyes at me  but the whole experienced was soured at that point 

The food didnt wow us  but our view may have been darkened by the whole atmosphere surrounding the service  Im not sure how in this day and age some restaurants dont get that its just as important as the food 

We spent  Euro 90 each for 3 courses  a glass of fizz and one bottle of wine  I felt like I had been robbed  In contrast the next night I ate in another restaurant  spent the exact same amount of money and had one of the best service experiences Ive had in Dublin  so walked away thinking what great value for money 

I feel like this restaurant is depending too much on being the cool kid in town and forgetting the basics of running a restaurant   making people feel welcome so that they want to return "
R0047,I will NEVER return to this Restaurant because it was so dim  I could not really see my food  
R0047,I have been twice before and eaten in the Snug with bigger parties and the light was fine there   I made the point re lighting to the maitre d who said they wanted atmosphere and was very very reluctant to even bring another candle and had to be asked twice   Its such a pity as the food is excellent  I was a guest of another couple who were similarly peering at their food and will also never return  
R0047,Incredible food  absolutely delicious  Great style and decor 
R0047,Incredible  Perfect evening in Dublin 
R0047,Just had drinks here but the food that was going by our table looked delicious  Huge bowls of chicken wings  Staff were really attentive and pleasant 
R0047,Love short menus   in my opinion it indicates that all the ingredients are fresh  and  seasonal  Service was excellent  friendly and observant   Excellent food  and  value for money  Would highly recommend 
R0047,Loved everything about this place   food  service  atmosphere   cant wait to go back
R0047,Loved the decor  Staff were great  Food was good however menu was limited and it aint cheap at  Euro 36 for 2 courses at the weekend 
R0047,Loved this restaurant   Food was great as were the cocktails and Irish Coffee 
R0047,Lovely food lovely service    just lovely   
R0047,Lovely meal and great service 
R0047,Lovely meal here  very friendly staff and food was incredible  Will be recommending to friends 
R0047,Lovely restaurant  amazing food  fabulous service 
R0047,Lovely spot  great menu  staff good fun and great atmosphere   All round go hiontach   
R0047,Lovely staff great food and very nice interior  Popular so book ahead 
R0047,Mince pie served cold  poor pastry and very  little filling 
R0047,"My fourth visit here but unfortunately my dining experience this time was below par 
Our waitress was excellent but the beef main course was very disappointing"
R0047,"My lamb main was very good and the smoked salmon starter was good from what was a limited menu  Overall thought it was somewhat overpriced but nothing bad to say about the food  My partner was not as impressed with her hake main as I was 
11 50 per glass of wine "
R0047,"My wife  and  I booked a table here for our wedding anniversary   As someone with a love of Irish culture  and  traditions I had hoped that this place would tick some of those boxes on the culinary front   While the food was certainly very good  even if the portions were tiny    and  locally sourced we found this place to be a restaurant of contradictions 
On the one hand you have top quality Irish food served in a listed Victorian building exuding charm  right down to the jeans  t shirt  and  NB runners worn by staff members  If youre going to dress well for a special occasion in a decent restaurant  and  pay above the odds its a let down to be met by staff who are dressed as though theyve just popped out for a loaf of bread 
Overall this restaurant seems to be suffering from an identity crisis  as though its owners feel obliged to offset its traditional decor  and  indigenous food with an oh so contemporary Dublin demeanour   For someone with traditional tastes like myself ultimately failed to deliver  even if the barman does make a mighty Irish coffee   Ar an drochuair  n� bheidh muid ag dul ar ais  "
R0047,New Years so it was amazing and just what we wanted
R0047,Nice place  delicious food and polite straff  Would recommend the place to my friends 
R0047,One of the best meals I have had in Dublins city center
R0047,One of the best meals Ive eaten  Great tasting food  with creative plates of flavours put together  Great ambiance and decor  Highly recommend 
R0047,One of the best meals Ive had in Ireland 
R0047,one of the best meals we have had for a long time  The concise menu means they really focus on serving delicious plates of food  nice traditional setting and all in all a fantastic evening  A must try place I would highly recommend 
R0047,Our host recommended this place to us and we are so glad that we made time to go  The food was exceptional; Ive never tasted anything like it  The service was excellent   prompt and the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming  It was also a lovely environment and atmosphere to spend a few hours in  Highly recommend 
R0047,Outstanding from start to finish  flavours were amazing with every dish  well done
R0047,Outstanding meal  All dishes were tasty and well conceived  Would return in a heart beat 
R0047,Outstanding restaurant  wine list is made of very good french references   Very good indeed
R0047,Over priced  And will not be going here again
R0047,"Pressure to give up the table  Wasnt told this when booking or when we arrived  Disappointed with service overall  felt rushed 
Food very nice  Would like 2 3 more choices "
R0047,"Quality food  staff and setting 
Would highly recommend for any occasion"
R0047,"The wok fried greens and chili prawns were delicious  the pork bulgogi was pretty good  the chicken yakitori was definitely poor and the ebi gyoza was without doubt the worst gyoza Ive ever had  hands down  
Also the waitress we had was over the top pushy practically ordering the menu for us  Not something I appreciate I gotta say "
R0047,Really a great experience  Food was outstanding and so was the service 
R0047,Really cool place and food is excellent  Highly recommend 
R0047,Really great food with the best service I have gotten in a dublin restaurant in a long time  Good atmosphere too  Ill be back soon 
R0047,Really great meal in beautiful surroundings with great service   Hope to be back soon 
R0047,Disappointing finish 
R0047,Really lovely food although not quite 5 star quality  The smoked salmon starter was very bland and a little rubbery  Our waiter was excellent and very attentive  However when leaving we were left waiting for our coats  completely ignored  When we did ask the person was clearly offended at being asked  Eventually we just found our own coats and left 
R0047,Really top class  Brilliant food in a lovely environment and classy without being stuffy 
R0047,Satisfying on every level  Taste  place and people
R0047,Sensational food in a lovely informal atmosphere  We will definitely return
R0047,Service was shockingly slow to the point that I wondered was it so that wed drink more wine   
R0047,Simply outstanding tapas 
R0047,Super fresh food  great service and lovely ambience  Already booked to return 
R0047,Super great  Initially we saw the menu and judged it was limited  Once our meal came we realized less was more  Highly recommend  
R0047,Super restaurant will definitely go back great food and wine great service loved cocktail bar too
R0047,Superb dining experience  Excellent cocktails  wonderful wines and exceptional food presented with style 
R0047,terrible price for a reasonable meal   why does the review have to be fifty characters long
R0047,The chips werent as crispy as you might like but they were seasoned well  The main event  the nachos  were generous and pretty tasty but not quite as moreish as I expected 
R0047,The food here was absolutely incredible  The small set menu gives the restaurant to perfect their dishes  and they did exactly that  We had the three course menu and were blown away by the taste and flavours of the food  Im still dreaming about the meal and cant wait to go back and try more food options  The staff was professional and kind  and the ambiance was lovely  I will be highly recommending this restaurant to friends and family 
R0047,The food was delicious  I would definitely recommend going there 
R0047,The food was superb     lovely atmosphere and really nice staff   I will definitely be back 
R0047,People are raving about this place  I hsve no doubt this place wzs great when it first opened and when it was first recommended to me  Perhaps I should have tried it then  They seem to be confidently resting on their laurels that their booming business will continue  I believe they are ripping people off with tiny portions and over priced wine  If they want to stay in the market they will have to do alot better thsn this 
R0047,This experience certainly can be equated with the emperors new clothes story  I for one will not be returning
R0047,This is a wonderful restaurant  Food is absolutely top class  Staff were brilliant  Highly recommended 
R0047,This was a great find  Food  service  decor  music all fantastic   Well be back  5 out of 5
R0047,This was my 4th visit here and will not be the last
R0047,This was my favorite meal in Ireland 
R0047,"This was my third time  Very pleased 1st time   less so the 2nd and very disappointed last Wednesday  
There was nothing special about the food to justify the tiny portions and the high prices  It was extremely poor value 
All of our party eat out very regularly  2 of us frequently entertaining business guests at Dublin restaurants  We will not be returning any time soon "

R0047,Top quality food and service
R0047,Truly delicious contemporary food with excellent service  A must visit 
R0047,Very charming ambiance  Nice but not fussy  Extremely precise presentation  Great staff 
R0047,Very good food  friendly staff  wine a bit expensive  
R0047,very tasty meal in lovely surroundings with a delicious bottle of wine
R0047,We arrived here for our first ever visit on a very very wet and miserable night in April     as soon as we walked in we were greeted warmly and the space was very cosy and inviting  The rest of the night went along in the same vein     from the maitre d to our really fantastic waitress no one could do enough  The food was very very tasty as were the very original cocktails    No one rushed us to leave although when we looked around at one stage we realised that we were the last there  I would very highly recommend a visit for the wonderful food  drinks and also the very lovely staff 
R0047,We had a cozy window seat for a perfect date night  Top notch meals  and  friendly service  Highly recommend 
R0047,We had an excellent evening  celebrating a birthday  Our party had the snug to ourselves  which was lovely  The traditional pub decor is really charming  The food is genuinely exceptional   a small  imaginative menu of beautiful dishes  Armand was especially welcoming and helpful   the staff overall were excellent   extremely knowledgeable  Id highly recommend this restaurant and will be back 
R0047,"We ordered online an omelette and some chicken 
The omelette was terrible  it was burned and it didnt barely had any ingredient on it  The taste wasnt good at all 
I cant believe people think this chicken is good  it was extremely salty and with a lot of oil 
The wort  by far  were the fries  The worst dinner I had in Dublin "
R0047,We were a party of 4 celebrating a birthday part and had a wonderful experience in this restaurant  We loved everything about the meal  delicious food beautifully prepared cooked and presented    Great wine possibilities and excellent service   Have booked this restaurant to celebrate the forthcoming birthday celebration   would highly recommend this restaurant
R0047,We were really looking forward to our wedding anniversary dinner  All started well with a 5 30 pm Friday booking  After being shown to our table we proceeded to order from the specials menu  I had the chicken sausage and my wife the carrot combo  Both appetizers were lacking in taste  size and satisfaction  For mains we both had the hake which was cooked to perfection but again without any thought for flavor or accompaniments  We ordered a bottle of Italian white which was delicious and highlight of the dinner  Service was surprisingly business like and lacking in charm or charisma  Our total bill amounted to  Euro 110  based on our experience we choose not to leave a tip  which frankly was an awful waste of money  We are not the regular crank or critic but we would find it very difficult to recommend or to go back there  For this I am truly sorry 
R0047,When the food arrived it was just as I remembered it from all the previous times; plain  unoriginal and uninspired  We got pizza  Pizza that sadly had less toppings and sauce than youre average frozen one from Tesco  Its was as if somebody had gone and purposely taken all the flavour out of the meal  A pity I have to admit  This place has so much potential but completely lacks service and without a doubt needs an upgraded menu 
R0047,While the location was ideal and staff nice the food we ordered was inedible  The chicken satay was like leather  The Thai fried rice was so greasy and lacked any semblance of Thai fried rice  no depth of spices  It tasted like bad Chinese takeaway rice  When my pad see ew arrived I asked if there was a mistake because it looked like pad Thai nothing about it was pad see ew  Four pieces of tofu so salty and obvious lack of sweet soy sauce  Dont waste your time or money here 
R0047,Wonderful food in a really cool space 
R0048,The food was very disappointing  bland and poorly presented  The service was also poor  no engagement with us and felt like they were eager to rush us in and out  Loud latino music videos playing on screen created a weird atmosphere  Overall very disappointed as I had read very positive reviews online and the occasion was a treat for my husbands birthday 
R0048,"When we arrived  they hadnt made up a table for 10  When we told them we were 10  they made a table for 8  and said they would fix it   When the rest of the group arrived  they still hadnt fixed it after telling them 3 times  After fixing it  we sat down  and it was freezing cold  We all had our jackets  scarves and gloves on  They were not very nice  and did not once apologise for not fixing the table and the fact that it was almost 0 degrees  


The food was good  but the overall experience was not at all great  
Not pleased with this visit "
R0049,10th wedding anniversary celebration  Had a great exerience
R0049,A great place for a causal meal with such friendly staff  Will always come back 
R0049,Always great food and service
R0049,Amazing food and service  when in Dublin  GO  MAke sure to have reservations 
R0049,As always you get a great welcome from all
R0049,"Cant say anything about the restaurant apart from one thing   they dont respect the app table bookings  The table wasnt there for us  and we were stood for 20 mins  until eventually we were guided a couple blocks away to an ""affiliated"" Indian restaurant  In fairness  we did get some compensation in form of a voucher and a few meals on the house  but it doesnt change the fact  that we had not eaten in this place as we intended "
R0049,Delicious food  great service  Early bird is great value
R0049,Excellent food  service  ambiance and value   Would highly recommend as favourite ethnic restaurant in city centre 
R0049,Excellent service and food as always
R0049,"Food was great and plentiful   Family of 6 and we ate all
Thanks "
R0049,Food was lovely  service was very poor we had to constantly wave at staff for water and menus  The restaurant was not busy   
R0049,Food was very tasty  Service was prompt and efficient  Lovely ambience  I will definitely be back in the future 
R0049,"Great Breakfast food  lovely staff  desserts were UNREAL  apple pie and white chocolate cheesecake  
10/10 would recommend"
R0049,"Great food 
Great restaurant 
Dear enough for family of 6 but very enjoyable"
R0049,I would NOT recommend this restaurant simply because they could not be bothered fullfilling their obligation to honour my booking  They rang me 48hrs before the appointment to CANCEL pretty simply  No reason other than they couldnt take us at the time  they had previously confirmed    I was gutted and couldnt  get anywhere else given that it was the week before xmas  WORSE SERVICE EVER 
R0049,Im not a preachy veggie but Im really tired of being treated like my meal order is just a casual preference  Eating meat makes me feel sick so this happening is a real inconvenience to me 
R0049,Lovely food  staff were all very friendly and polite  Excellent value too  Would certainly recommend 
R0049,"Mix of good and bad  Made a reservation thru web; showed up at the right time  Friday evening  to find it packed with a couple of parties waiting to be seated  We mentioned that we had a reservation and the host replied  ""sorry  we are full   please go to other restaurant a couple of blocks down and they will accommodate you""  We were a bit annoyed but decided to take it in our stride  holiday season    Went to other place and they were full as well  and turning away all the parties being sent down from the place  This level of unprofessionalism and incompetence was annoying  but again   we let it go and luckily grabbed a table at Yamamori nearby  A few days later  we stopped by mid week as this is next to our apartment  and were accommodated rightaway and the food was decent  Hence the mixed review   they provide a decent meal but havent figured out how to run a business and be customer oriented "
R0049,Nice food surf and turf was nice done right aswell very busy but worth the wait Id come again 
R0049,Outstanding food and service as always  The place never ever disappoints 
R0049,Service was excellent  Food was good  but one dish was not ideal 
R0049,Shocking experience  made feel like everything is an effort  Staff were very poor  no organisation  Waiting over a half hour and received our main courses before our starters and there was no apology  Finally finished our mains got the dessert menu and waited over 15 minutes for someone to come back to us  Told them we just wanted the bill  which was wrong and the waiter seemed to be annoyed at the fact we told him it was wrong  Would never go back 
R0049,Soo tasty and interesting combinations   Great staff too who can always come up with something special for you too  
R0049,The food was not that great  A tad pricy with smaller servings which took ages  over 30 mins to come  The only thing I found good about this restaurant was that the atmosphere and seating was pretty nice and the posh feel to it  But this would be one of those once off places I would only go with my mom on mothers day or something  Not for a regular lunch though 
R0049,They refused to honour my reservation
R0049,We had it 6 months ago and it was much better then 
R0049,We used to love this place  This time the food was not edible  The tandoori chicken was so dry� it was difficult to chew  We left less than half a meal 
R0049,We were in Dublin for just one day and wanted to have Indian food  It was superb 
R0049,What a fun place   Irish Music in the evenings  great pub food and wonderful  friendly  skilled bar tenders   a must stop 
R0049,Yes I would friendly  and helpful staff I would go back its been a while  both my wife and myself  were there
R0050,A real treat  Beautiful food  great wine list and really friendly staff  Would highly recommend 
R0050,Amazing food   really authentic Italian cuisine and great service
R0050,Amazing place and great food  Team is excellent and does take care of you  We will be back 
R0050,Amazing place with an authentic Italian feel  Food was so tasty and well worth the price  Wasnt too loud and we were looked after so well 10/10
R0050,Beautiful restaurant  food was delicious and the staff couldnt have been better  Thank you  will definitely be back 
R0050,Came back on a busy Friday night for their Butternut Squash Ravioli  my favourite main course I tried so far there 
R0050,Chef omitted ingredients from a couple of the dishes  leaving food very average and presentation like a home cooked meal  In general food tasted good  cannolo was a good desert choice  However restaurant lacked quality  professionalism and atmosphere  Staff were very nice and accommodating on all issues  While we were not cold  the lack of heat added to the lack of ambience of the restaurant 
R0050,Excellent food  friendly staff  the pistachio panacota was amazing  Will definitely come back 
R0050,Great wine  and  food  Best Service
R0050,Had a great time  lovely staff and delicious food  Would recommend  
R0050,Loved this little restaurant   very quaint   nice atmosphere too  Staff and food excellent  will go back again
R0050,My favorite place in Dublin  I go there twice a month  for brunch  lunch  dinner  afternoon tea  It always perfect
R0050,Outstanding food and service    in a city of mostly pub food  this is a welcome change of pace and an absolute gem   Highly recommended   
R0050,Really tasty and satisfying  Wonderful ingredients  Beautiful salads  Highly recommend it if you re looking for some good nourishment
R0050,The food is presented beautifully and the taste lives up to the presentation  The prices are very reasonable for the quality as well 
R0050,"Thursday 13th   6:00 pm  was my 2nd time here  This time the overall experience was very disappointing     it took a long time until we even got a menu then 30 min before they got our order  The waiters were dismissive  Food arrived cold   by the time we got our desert was 9:00 pm  
There was a table of 3  that were very loud  number guest left because of them  Yet the staff didnt approach them once to ask them to keep the noise down    because the staff were no where to be found   

I wont be visiting the restaurant again     what a pity    It is great location and has a lot of potential "
R0051,2nd visit for me   We were party of 7  The main courses were very good 
R0051,3 times there and 3 different experiences     from great to sub  optimal  So you need to manage your expectations
R0051,A rude waiter made the experience very uncomfortable  I actually suspect that he is quite senior  perhaps even a manager  but his manner was utterly unacceptable  Disappointing 
R0051,All was good with the meal until a senior waiter or manager stood behind us with our coats straight after we paid even though we were still talking and finishing our drinks  We had not asked for the coats and we actually had the meal served to us quite quickly  3 courses each and a bottle of wine in less than 1hr 15 mins  my receipt confirms this  It was pretty embarrassing to be honest as it was evident to those around us that he was standing waiting for us to get up from our chairs  There was plenty of seats available for other diners so Im not sure why this happened 
R0051,Always a good option for a few drinks or some food 
R0051,Always a great experience  Food is fab  staff are so friendly   and very accommodating if your party size changes  Highly recommend the delicious and generous sized meat and cheese sharing plate   perfect to enjoy with a glass of prosecco in the sunshine 
R0051,"Ate at 13:00 on Sunday 1 July  

Waitress  name began with a J  did not write down order  Got the order wrong when repeating it back  a clear sign that she should have written the order down  

Food had clearly been sitting under a heater for some time before it was served  

Side order of fries did not arrive with food ordered   Eventually arrived after food was finished  

Corned beef hash was served without bernaise sauce  

Extra portion of fries was added to bill "
R0051,Beautiful meal here again  Staff were super  very friendly waitress  Couldnt recommend this place highly enough  
R0051,Been here before  and i could not fault the food at any point but upon return it was a disaster  We ordered 2x Ribeyes one medium one medium well  and the pappardelle  My steak  Medium  was cooked perfectly but some of the fat was still raw  on the second steak requested medium well it was rare in the middle and dry  The pappardelle was cooked well but the sauce was potent with garlic  The deserts were fine but the mains were a let down in comparison to our first experience 
R0051,"Booked a table for lunch on Dec 28th for 12 30 for two  This was neant to be a special Christmad gift to my friend  However  when we arrived we were told that there was no lunch menu available  This was despite the fact that the full menu was advertised on the online booking  The only menu available was a brunch menu       This wasnt what I booked  What an embarrassment  Particulary  as I had talked so positivelt about my previous experience there   I explained the situation to my friend who  graciously  agreed to go elsewhere for lunch  
This was an extremely disappointing experience that could have been easily avoided "
R0051,Booked for lunch but as we would have been the only guests in the large upstairs restaurant we opted to have brunch instead downstairs in the outside patio  Brunch was  uninspired staples with cocktail option  Music level increased throughout brunch until it became so loud as to be irritating  Service was good and best part of the experience  Not worth it  considering the good lunch/brunch option sin town 
R0051,Delicious brunch and a complementary glass of Prosecco with was lovely 
R0051,"Disapointed   
Rizoto was not good  maximum 8cl of wine in the glass  and too noisy "
R0051,"Disappointing   no luncheon menu  very expensive and limited options   wine list was crazy prices   waitress hadnt got a clue      but fortunately the food was GOOD 
  Will not be back     almost 70 euros for a 1 course lunch + wine      "
R0051,This place has managed to create  a great balance between good food and good value in a very nice environment 
R0051,Excellent service  but the burgers are cooked either medium or well done  Dry  tough  no taste 
R0051,First of all the environment was very dirty and there was no place to sit  When we came we had to wait ten minutes to doer and when we tried to order food but the women wouldnt understand what we were trying to say  She charged and my friends double the original price and it was disgrace  My friend ordered strawberry milkshake and it tasted disgusting  
R0051,Firstly the food is top notch always is delicious and have been here and always love coming to this place with family  so when you visit a restaurant 2 things are very important firstly quality of food and secondly quality of service and I already have highlighted that the food there is top notch but the service is not so top notch  was greeted by this guy with glasses and what a tosser basically this guy was awful and very very rude and unprofessional and as a result by his behaviour I will not be dinning at this establishment as a result anymore
R0051,Food was good but portion sizes are extremely small  Poor value for money as its not cheap  Was expecting small portions but these were ridiculously small
R0051,Food was OK  The waitress  however  was the opposite of polite and attentive  I was the only guest in the restaurant and she did not even remember bringing me the drink which I had ordered  I will not go back  There are lots of other places around 
R0051,From the start this was the perfect place to kick off our first time in Dublin   The place had everything from exceptional service  great ambience and the food/drinks were fantastic   Highly recommend this stop for any visitor 
R0051,Good tea  good coffee  good food  Food portion on the border of being small  You definitely wont be disappointed but lacking of wow factor 
R0051,Great location and atmosphere  it is a fun place to be   Food I have to say was normal  as of course it was good enough but it was not anything out of the ordinary  nothing really special  I would go back because it was fun place and location  not dying to go back because had such an amazing food experience  Most annoying was am afraid our server  maybe he was having a bad day  but from the moment we sat down he was quite not interested in a way  sort of absent  did the minimum service/contact with us  so it was a bit of  whats wrong with him  What have we done  Hope you find this helpful though 
R0051,Great venue  great menu  great food   unfortunately heavily under staffed   The service wasnt bad  because the staff were un attentive but it was bad because the few staff available werent able to sufficiently look after the amount of patrons in the restaurant   We waited 1 5hrs for our meal  from sitting down   Although the food was great  once it arrived   we didnt order desserts as by that stage it was very late 
R0051,I am afraid we had a terrible service experience  Nothing wrong with the food that we enjoyed  The manager did apologise and even offered us to have our food free of charge however we did pay for the food since it was eaten and enjoyed  the evening was ruined but the unnaceptable service we recieved  Our table was constantly ignored  after 1 5 hours we only managed to have our starter  couldnt order wine  and so on  it was difficult to understand the situation After several attempts we managed to get hold of a server and whilst we politely explained the situation the reaction was just very ignorant   A real shame  having said that  the service and experience at the bar downstairs was the opposite and it was excellent 
R0051,"I have now tried this place twice  �On both occasions I have been disappointed 
Soggy  greasy veg tempura  though I admit its not ideal for a takeaway dish  and pork ribs that should have been thrown out the previous night  but were instead heated up and served to unwitting customers like me  who threw them out on their behalf  but paid for the privilege  �You could have bounced them off the floor  and the sauce was a thick  gooey  gloopy mess  �
Avoid "
R0051,I m afraid this restaurant does not succeed in offering real Italian cuisine  Food quality is ok  but preparations are terrible  Better to have real Italian chefs to have a real Italian offer  Too expansive as well 
R0051,"I went with 3 friends and we could not find anything on the restaurent menu that we liked  all the dishes were very busy and I felt overpriced   
 Euro 18 50 for pasta is excessive   We left without eating in restaurant"
R0051,Ive been to a majority of Michelin restaurants in the world  I travel a good amount  This was by far the worst experience we had at a restaurant  We were celebrating our engagement and were let down big time  �The Japanese tapioca  tomato courses had no taste at all  very slimy in texture  �Next the foie gras terrine on top of a chicken brick was exactly how that sounded  �Felt like we were eating cold cuts squeezed into a rectangular brick  �Finally  the main course of lamb was cold  and bland  �
R0051,Ive eaten here many times before and never a problem   However  mozarella and tomato salad almost frozen and inedible as it was not at room temperature   Venison very rare   I wasnt asked how I would like it cooked   Risotto served with outer leaves of artichoke   Not very nice   Overpriced overall   Almost  Euro 90 for 3 early birds  one water and two minerals   No wine 
R0051,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would  Absolutely the worst place I have been to in Dublin  possible also ever in my life  This review is for the service  

My friend and I were looking for a place to have dinner and sit down and have a nice time together  We came across this place based on the raving reviews and went to try it  We walked in  about half an hour before closing time  Hooray  they had spots open and we got a table  My friend was the one who was hungry since she got out of a 5 hour flight  She ordered 2 sides from the menu  I just wanted to stick with water as I was full from earlier in the day  Our waiter came to take our order  She ordered and when asked what I wanted  I said nothing just water  He looked at me shocked  and just stared and said in a snooty tone  thats all  And I said yes  Than he came back 30 seconds later and said "" sorry you need to order a main dish in order to eat here "" Okay  fine my friend can do that  no problem  Oh noooo that wasnt it at all  Hes like: ""No  both of you need to order a main dish "" And proceeded to shove the menu in my face  Then he has the audacity to say that they sent people away as there was not a lot of availability in the restaurant  Are you kidding me   It was half an hour before closing and we got seated right away  Oh  he also said that ""we waiters need to get paid and we cant do that if you dont order 2 dishes""  Absolute bullshit  We even asked if we can order 1 main and share   even said wed get dessert   nothing  Super rigid  stone cold and completely unprofessional to say the least  Ive shared a meal plenty of times with my husband before  We had no problem  He proceeds to say nope  you need to order 2 mains or leave  Oh yes  he gave us an ultimatum  He didnt want to deal with our table so that was his way of getting rid of us  So despicable  So we left  Theres no way we are paying for a meal while being treated so poorly by this poor excuse of a waiter  No thank you  Do yourself a favor and take your business elsewhere  There are plenty of places in the area with MUCH better service where you will not be treated like a pile of garbage  I do not recommend 100 percent "
R0051,It was a lovely night  great food and service and the early bird three course for  Euro 30 was brilliant
R0051,Lovely starters but the main course was terrible  Very disappointing meal especially with the price  Wouldnt go back for food again but the staff were lovely
R0051,Non traditional spanish tapas  They call it tapas because they are small plates but you wont find your usual tortilla espa�ola  Id not recommend anything except the pork rind  Quite pricey for the size of the food 
R0051,Ok i feel a bit ridiculous writing a review of a chipper but   this is is a really good chipper  Legendary in fact  The food is reasonably priced  plentiful and proper greasy  Its open til some ridiculous hour of the morning  And conveniently located on Wexford Street  where you are quite likely to find yourself wandering around with the munchies on you at some ridiculous hour of the morning  Theres the added bonus that if youve lost your friends earlier in the night   youll almost certainly find them in here  You see  Legendary 
R0051,Place is lovely but food a bit too overdone  portion sizes too big and food a bit overdone  Cocktails lovely and service excellent
R0051,Really great service: Super friendly staff  Very nice atmosphere  Great food and wine selection 
R0051,Restaurant looks lovely  food was nicely presented but some dishes were lacking flavour and for the price that was disappointing  There were also a few mistakes in the order which when we told them  they sorted straight away  Staff were friendly 
R0051,Saturday evening   had set menu   great food and everyone agreed it was good value 
R0051,"Starter read �Gubeen with salami�  No cheese evident on the plate  Main dish was pasta with �pulled beef cheek� which was about 5 percent meat and the rest small chunks of fat all for a not insignicant price of  Euro 25  
Despite this disappointment the cocktail was excellent "
R0051,Steak and chips was  Euro 34 50 and was the fattiest steak Ive ever had  Ive been before and had a lovely pasta dish but the steak was terrible value for money  The three of us ordered it and none of us even finished half of the meal 
R0051,terrible  overpriced brunch  they didnt know how to cook a runny egg ��poached eggs should not be that cooked  and very bad cocktails 
R0051,The food was overpriced for what it was  We had dined the previous night at another restaurant and ordered the same amount of food   4 cocktails 2 starters 2 mains a side and a bottle of wine and the bill was  Euro 40 cheaper in the other restaurant   Euro 25 for a pasta dish is extortionate 
R0051,The food was really awful  The tartare was chewy and gross  my risotto was undercooked while my husbands linguine was overcooked  and the rhubarb on the dessert tart was literally inedible  Neither my husband nor I could even bite down into it    it was like biting into a rubber tube  
R0051,Third time and I have been starters were great mains ok but every time the service is rushed and we have been nearly pushed out prob wont go again 
R0051,This is the worst place to eat something in dublin  Just be carefull  In my opinion just DO NOT GO and DO NOT EAT in this place  I start VOMITING and shaking just 2 hours after i eat in this place
R0051,"This place has terrible service  I came on Wednesday night    after waiting 5 minutes to be seated  there were open tables   the waitress refused to look up from her phone and we left  
Dont waste your time "
R0051,This really is a gem of a place  Superb food at bistro type prices and fine dining service levels  Highly recommend 
R0051,This restaurant was very disappointing and bad value for money  We got sirloin steak which was fatty and greasy  We complained to the waitress who didnt care  Service was poor  We will never go back 
R0051,Three very disappointing courses for 25 euro  I would advise anyone thinking the all day dinner menu looks like a good value deal to think again  You will get served food that isnt fresh and feels like it has been taken from a nearby tesco and re heated 
R0051,"Very cool place with the best cocktail menu    They have a little book that has the history of cocktails all over the world and a cocktail to go along with each era  �The cocktails themselves are awesome and the bartenders put so much work into them  �Some they even use a little flame blower to finish the top  �They always have a cocktail and a beer of the week which are really good value and usually something a little different  �

I also love the decor and the fake library wall  The back of the bar is really cool like a big sculpture on the ceiling  �The staff are super friendly and know a lot about the drinks they serve  �

They also have a full food menu in the back section and have a bar menu in the front bar but i have never eaten here "
R0051,"Very poor acoustics so it was deafeningly loud  not that I would expect a place to be quiet of a Saturday evening; Im 25 and I had to practically shout across the table to be heard  

Service was chaotic and people didnt really seem to know which table was theirs for taking and delivering orders 

Food was decent but overpriced  especially considering the service and chaos you had to eat it in"
R0051,Very relaxing and great place for brunch  Loved those mimosas as well  Great
R0051,"Was expecting so much more   Nothing special about this place whatsoever my local chipper would have been more satisfying 
Burger was tasteless and dry  I didnt even eat half 
The service was friendly but was filled with drunks
I dnt know why but i expected a lot more anyway i wont ever return "
R0051,Was very disappointed with the service on Saturday night   there was so many mix ups including my incorrect mains being delivered to the table  wont be returning or recommending
R0051,Wasnt happy menu very limited   said there was a Sunday roast on menu online so disappointed as this wasnt on main menu     Service wasnt very good either
R0051,We had a lovely brunch and were really impressed by the venue  We had a lovely waitress who was excellent
R0051,We thoroughly enjoyed our evening   Food is great  the place looks lovely  the staff are brilliant     in particular Diana    Well be back 
R0051,"We was looking forward to trying the venison and squid ink pasta when we arrived we were told that they didnt have these items  When dessert came around we saw they had chocolate fondant  prosecco cream and rose petal sorbet the waiter told us that they didnt have this either  

Very disappointed  wouldnt go back"
R0051,We were very disappointed by our experience here  The room was really cold so we couldnt get comfortable  We had to remind the waitress a number of times for our drinks and she seemed annoyed at us for asking despite having asked a number of times  On the last time of asking she just went and made it which took 2 minutes and then brought it over so not sure why wasnt done on the first occasion  The food was quite tasty  At the end they overcharged us
R0051,When I booked the table I was not asked if I wanted smoking or not smoking   when we arrived the table was in the smoking area  Neither of us smoke but they wouldnt let us move inside   There seemed to be about 4 people seating patrons and none of them were very friendly or helpful  It was horrible in the outside area  people at other tables were smoking when we were eating   If youre by the wall its cold and if youre facing the heaters your face is on fire  The service wasnt great  really seemed like they couldnt be bothered  I think it could be so much better if they made more of an effort and checked if the table was to be smoking or non smoking 
R0052,Fantastic place  We were in Dublin for four days and came here 3 times  �The scones and coffee are delicious 
R0052,Delicious food   excellent service   calm atmosphere  Added advantage to bring own bottle for six euro corkage  Highly recommended
R0052,Delicious food and great service   we were celebrating our friends birthday and the staff surprised us with  a cake and a birthday song  Would definitely recommend 
R0052,Fab place  great service and food     we all loved James and his staff     great cocktails too    highly recommend coming here   
R0052,Very cute atmosphere and with personality  but on the crammed side of things  The cannoli we had were really something special  but the pistacchio and nutella cake didnt convince me
R0052,What a lovely experience  Amazing  tasty food  had a wonderful evening  Book ahead to avoid disappointment  Bring your own wine  no corkage charge  Very nice staff  Would not morally choose this type of cuisine but thoroughly enjoyed it and would love to return again 
R0053,"Ate in here last night  I consider it to be one of the most consistent Thai restaurants in Dublin  the best thing is the buzz  It feels like you are in a cool restaurant in Manhattan  

We ordered from the early bird  which is great value  Be warned  they dont just give it to you  you have to ask for it 

We ordered the black pepper squid and the spring rolls to start  Both tasty and generous portions  The squid in particular is great   For mains we ordered the Malaysian chicken salad which was really excellent  so much chicken and really tasty  We also ordered the bang curry  it is listed as ""very very spicy"" and it is not kidding  Even my boyfriend who loves really spicy food struggled with this one 

Lovely service and fresh ingredients very clearly used "
R0053,Foods average to better  drinks are the same as everywhere else and the service is pretty good  Rooftop bar is a plus and while loud the music is usually good 
R0053,Good Service friendly staff     food was excellent  and  good banter
R0053,I stopped in randomly but was pleasantly surprised  Good food  decent drinks  I would eat here again 
R0053,I went there for a quick lunch in my last day at dublin  Nice people and tasty soup  I tried the potato soup and loved it
R0053,The pizza was so good we went two nights in a row  Pizza  craft beer  friendly staff   Whats not to like 
R0053,We have been here twice  and we love this tapas place  You can do a early bird menu 16 99  and choose three different tapas  such a great deal  And theyre yummy 
R0054," The food tastes decent  

But compared to other Indian restaurants in Dublin the quantity served is too less for the price charged  Was definitely annoyed with the rule to order two mains  Was forced to order two side dishes and a main with just one Nan and one rice  

The service was not great either  Overall I wouldnt get back to this place "
R0054,"A trendy spot in Dublin for the younger crowd  After reading the reviews of fellow Yelpers it appears I made a wrong choice of what I ordered so I partially blame this review on myself  It seems like pizza is the thing to get here and now I am sad that I didnt  I ordered the curry and rice  Although it was an okay dish it was both lacking the heartiness of curry at local pubs or the flavor profile of a Thai curry  It came off as a dish that wasnt quite imitating a proper curry from any culture  

I did think that the presentation  the ambiance here and the service was all pretty good  I am not sure Id return since it wasnt one of the more memorable meals that I had in Ireland  especially for dinner "
R0054,After about 5 days in Dublin and local food we decided on PIZZA  �Wow frozen take home is at least triple better  �So happy we got a small  �My wife and I shared a slice  �The rest went to homeless on the street  �Not even sure if they had the rest  �I saw some dogs half an hour later with pizza  � Same  who knows  Skip this one 
R0054,Although the setting and ambience was nice  the quality of the food did not reflect the price that it was being sold at  Two burgers and two beers came to  Euro 40 and you can have a far better experience  both in terms of taste and value   elsewhere in the area 
R0054,Another great meal and super friendly staff   My kids love it  
R0054,Average food  Its a small place with little seating  Wife agrees and we cover the carnivore and herbivore selections  Definitely wouldnt go back
R0054,"Avocado  and  salsa  and I chose the chicken  It was quite a busy time and they had actually run out of the normal buns so had it all wrapped in a tortilla instead which I would actually recommend  Was a good option   the sweet potato fries were yum however maybe TOOOO sweet  
Nice vibes all round too  lovely staff  and  a DJ playing the good stuff to add to the atmosphere  "
R0054,"Bad day at the office  Wont be back  
Booked table for 19:45 but left standing for 10 minutes  When we sat down we werent given menus and had to go back and get them ourselves  Took too long to order  too long to serve  Waitress dropped a chicken wing on me  My main course never arrived and we had to leave to get to the cinema  Food was OK but service was shocking  They did comp us a bit but we wont be back "
R0054,Best wings in town  im obsessed 
R0054,Bland food  lacklustre service   Needs to try harder 
R0054,Chicken wings were nice  Wrong steak delivered and tagliatelle was a bit bland  Burgers were good 
R0054,"Choice on Menu very good 
Servers very attentive "
R0054,Everything excellent as always  One of my favourite branch 
R0054,"Food was pretty nice  decent portions  Service was very poor  Guys didnt go us tany  table water  didnt bring any napkins for sticky fingers  Nobody pop in to ask if there is everything ok     
had to ask twice for water  for desert menu  Not coming back "
R0054,"Four of us dined here at the weekend ahead of going to see a film close by  We were seated right away as we had booked online  Drinks were ordered   sparkling water only coming in the 750 ml size  We waited over an hour after our drinks to have our food  We didnt have starters    no one had ordered anything extra ordinary   I had  what turned out to be  a cold club sandwich while one of the others had an over cooked burger  the third a salad while the biggest problem seemed to be with our fourth member who had ordered the chicken with mashed potato   his dinner arrived almost 15 minutes later again  There was no apology     just an explanation that it took longer to cook the chicken     

We were not offered as much as a refill of our water glasses while we waited  let alone some bread  or even an update  Each time we had to ask one of the passing staff for an update on what turned out to be  pretty mediocre food   

The inordinate delay in bringing the food to the table was amazing and I can only assume that the order was lost until we asked about the food   

I eat out a fair bit and love to support local places especially when they are getting off the ground  I love close to Rathmines  I know that s*** happens and food orders get mixed up or lost   no problem with that except you tell the truth   That was my biggest disappointment   being treated like a fool   You dont put food in front of three members of a party of four and leave one waiting  Bad form  You at least offer bread and water to the table or some sort of discount off the bill     and you dont say that it takes an hour and fifteen minutes to cook a chicken breast and you have the grace to send THE manager over to that table to say  have a coffee on us  "
R0054,Good atmosphere but overall the food was poor value for money 
R0054,great food  service excellent  we enjoy the decor and the table  the place is definitely for foody night ambiance is romantic
R0054,"Horrific save your money and go elsewhere   I booked a table of six for my mothers birthday and everything was fine until the food arrived   I cant fault the waitress she was so lovely and helpful   however the 2 members of staff who i am assuming are managers due to them wearing their own clothes could do with some customer service training   tried to get their attention multiple times to ask about the wait time and for water top up   to which they both put their heads down and ignored on multiple occasions despite our table being joined to the welcome areas where they were both stood    After asking that the food not be separated into starters and mains instead just all together   two baskets of wings arrived   which i cant fault   only thing   we then waited over 50 minutes for our main courses   no explanation no reason why it was so delayed as the place wasnt that busy   the worst part of this was that the 6 year old child in the party  had to wait over an hour and a half for a plate of cold plain pasta   as she didnt have a starter  
3 burgers in total for the table   dry as anything with no sauce and a handful of chips that looked like it had been thrown on the plate   Everything was dry   from the burgers to the chicken salad   a chicken salad which we were charged  Euro 3 extra for the chicken  The club sandwich had a dark black hair wedged in between the bread and meat   accidents happen I get that but it was managed disgustingly   the waitress again I can not fault her she took it away embarrassed and brought it to the two plain clothes staff members   who then stood less than 5 feet away from our table and continued to speak about us openly   pointing at the member of my party who had found the hair explaining "" sure she has her hair down its hers "" They sent the waitress back to our table to say it would be taken off the bill   what a horrible situation to put your staff in   If you cant treat your staff OR customers correctly there is really no hope "
R0054,I cant remember our servers name but he was excellent  Really friendly and efficient  And the food was so good  We had a great time 
R0054,I did not find the place to be as good as the others reviewing here the food was no better than I have had in restaurants around Dublin  Unfortunately I was disappointed    and would not be going back 
R0054,I have always liked dax but it has taken a step up with the new team in the kitchen  Food and service very good
R0054,Id recommend for wings but not for chargrilled burger the meat was dry and cheese was gloopy
R0054, I was damn close to walking out as I was getting increasingly hangry  but against my better judgement I stayed 
R0054,It was by far the worst meal I have ever eaten in Dublin  I have been living in Dublin since 1984  The only redeeming trait was the friendly and competent Romanian waiter 
R0054,its hard to support local businesses when you never quite know what to expect 
R0054,Lovely little restaurant  great staff and sublime food  Remarkable value for money  Just go  You will love it  
R0054,Most enjoyable evening   Food and service first class 
R0054,"Nice food  small portions but with elegance  friendly staff  Definitely wanna go back again

Had bunch of small plates but my favorite was the soft shell crabs"
R0054,Not enough staff working  The tables are too close together  The air conditioning was sub zero  Really wasnt happy  Also    we wasted a lot of food as the portions were huge  A little advice from the staff would have helped us out there 
R0054,"On Sunday afternoon  about 4pm  I arrived with my two daughters to a half empty restaurant and we were shown to the table beside the toilet  there were empty tables all around 

We just wanted something quick so we reached ordered a main and some green tea  Green Tee was brought for the two girls but not me  Five minutes later we were told that the mains that the girls had ordered  beef  had run out 

We left  disappointed "
R0054,Over 1 hour waiting for starters to be cleared before getting a small  over cooked burger and greasy chips
R0054,"Pretty average experience here really   nothing particularly stood out either way  
"
R0054,Stay away from this place  They forced us to buy food 
R0054,"Prosecco was flat  bottle must have been opened a long time 
My husbands food  chicken  and  mash  was literally floating in sauce  inedible 
My burger was burnt  and  tasteless  I asked for the thick cut chips  and  the server told me she didnt know if it was possible cause they only served them with the steak  and  I was getting a burger  So I got thin chips which were so well done I could barely chew them  obviously fired more than once  I was willing to pay extra for the thick cut ones but she wouldnt give them to me  
Service was horrendous  took ages to get cutlery/napkins/water top ups  
The lid wasnt properly on the vinegar so when I went to pour it on my chips vinegar spilt all over my plate 
Overall just a very unpleasant experience 
Chicken wings were good though to give credit were its due "
R0054,Ran out of shrimp so I had to choose something else  Music was very loud so I couldnt hear people at the table  My meal was very small so I didnt feel it was value for money
R0054,Disgraceful rudeness from a particular staff member and shockingly bad food  Ive been eating here since college  many moons ago  but never �ever again 
R0054,"Serious delays in bringing courses to the table  mistake with the order for one of our party which took a long time to rectify   Food was okay  Second time to visit and similar experience this time 

Staff were pleasant enough but serious overhaul on the operations side needed  Had the potential to be a really popular restaurant but some serious remedial work required  Hope you can turn this around "
R0054,"Service and food was very poor  We had crabcakes  eggs and avocado  I asked for medium they were hard  my sister was ill after the crabcakes  Chickem wings were nice thats about it   I had requested online a cake or small dessert for my sisters birthday lunch nothing came or no mention of it 

Very poor I wont be back"
R0054,Service appalling  food average  acoustics terrible  Zero atmosphere and nowhere near enough staff on  Given that tables are mainly booked in advance  theres no excuse for inadequate staffing levels 
R0054,Service is okay  Food is nice  beers are very nice  a lot of interesting choices and unfamiliar beers 
R0054,Service slow especially to place order and order drinks  Burgers poor  overcooked and poor presentation  Chicken wings excellent  Draft beer available but nowhere on menu  Pricey 
R0054,Service was poor  Had to ask about 5 times for water  Coffee was cold   even after complaining about the first one and being assured the 2nd would be hot and the 1st would be knocked off the bill   neither of which happened  Food was fine but nothing special and very expensive 
R0054,Service was slow  tables left uncleared for a long time  slow to be served a drink  food unremarkable
R0054,Service was very poor  Server seemed like he would rather be anywhere else  Food was terrible except for the wings  3 out of 7 meals sent back or not eaten   Server argued about the complaints to make matters worse  Calimari seemed like it was from Iceland supermarket   A lot of kids and noisier than other kid friendly places  The manager did take things off the bill and gave 10 percent reduction so fair play but would never go back  Tribeca in Ranelagh has wings just as nice and more  No affiliation 
R0054,Service was very slow despite restaurant not being full  Quality of food was average and extremely over priced 
R0054,Staff were friendly but the food was overpriced and not well made  Would not come back 
R0054,"Tables too close together youre on top of the next person   Service not great waited a long time for our order to be taken 
Food was nice "
R0054,Terrible experience got a glass of pinot grigio with suds when i asked to speak to person responsible he could not give me a reason and was very unhelpful i asked for Manager who replaced it with a proper glass the meals came but we all had to wait at least 5 more minutes for the fries and then a 25 euro SERVICE CHARGE i will be taking this further
R0054,The chicken wings are a good as ever    but the attitude of the staff  and  the general ambience in Rathmines was awful  I wont be returning 
R0054,The food was just okay  There are lots of other places that have better burgers and chips and for better value  We wont be returning 
R0054,The food was terrible  The burger was completely overcooked but still came out cold with a lump of unmelted cheese under it  The club sandwich was also very bad  The chicken was very dry  Service was good and our waitress was lovely  However  will not be back 
R0054,The location and ambience is fabulous  I dined with a party of 4 and was the only person to not got the pancakes  To say the least I had serious food envy  I tried the pancakes which were fab     I found my eggs royale nice but the poached eggs were slightly under done for my liking  I will definitely be back for the pancakes 
R0054,The quality of the food was very poor  My chips were oily and the omelette was fine but very poorly presented  Over priced for very mediocre food 
R0054,The salads and burgers are delicious  Such a family friendly restaurant and serves solicitous dishes for any type of eater 
R0054,The service was awful  It wasnt busy  every member of staff went passed our table once we finished our starter yet it was about 25 minutes before our table was cleared  Another 20 25 minutes went passed there was no side of our main which was a bowl of soup  2 sandwiches and a side of fries  larger tables who came in way after us were getting their food before us  when we asked what the hold up was  we were told whoever cleared our table never said we were ready for mains  No apology was given at all 
R0054,The staff in this restaurant is extremely rude  �They act as if the guests are imposing on them by being there  �Our waitress was constantly taking personal calls instead of ordering our food  The coffee tasted bad and the lavender lemonade tasted horrible  �Our order came out wrong and the food didnt taste very good  �With all of the cafes in the area  this one is not worth a second visit 
R0054,The staff were terrific   They kept checking that everything was to our satisfaction   Extremely professional and it was refreshing to get such good service 
R0054,"The wings are the only nice thing 
The burger was as hard as a rock and dry  
The club sandwich was below par  
Expensive for what u get and the service was only good"
R0054,"There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that there is  in fact  a place 1 but theyve been here so long that the name aint gonna change now  place II is ok  but nothing special  doing most of their business around that messy time when the pubs close 

They do however  offer student discounts and sell very basic rolls for  Euro 2 20  Which  to put things into context  is the price of a bus fare  Not too shabby  not too shabby at all "
R0054,This is a great new addition to the area  lots of coffee choice and good sandwiches  The shop is modern and clean  yes the smell of fresh paint too 
R0054,"This is the first time Ive had to rate someplace so low  The service was terrible  The host was rude  Two waitresses came by to ask if we were ready to order and both promptly left without our order when we said ""yes""  The chef came by  Only then were we allowed to order  The waitress threw food at us  and was annoyed we were there so long  the duration was due to not being able to order for 15 minutes   Checking out was even worse  

The cashier kept getting the order wrong  despite it being written on a ticket   She tried to overcharge me twice  Complained when I corrected her  Then mocked me as if I had a learning disability  

I had hoped to write that the food would overcome this but it was overwrought  My omelette wasnt salted so it was dry and tough  bleeding out a runny mess  My companions beans were salted beyond edibility  

Avoid this place "
R0054,This place doesnt know how to keep the music at a level that people can actually enjoy themselves  Too loud  Bar man couldnt even hear me  Place is filth too  Good with much needed refurbishment      
R0054,Unfortunately we did not get to try any  We waited and waited and had a couple beers and by the time we finally got a table and ordered food  30 minutes went by and the waitress came back and said she forgot to put our order in  So we left  Really disappointed
R0054,This used to be my go to place for Fish and Chips when in town   No more  �Service was slow although the place was virtually empty   Fish and Chips were soggy  greasy  �and in general     Terrible  They should return to old format of ordering from the counter and sitting down  One star is being gracious 
R0054,This was absolutely terrible  I sent the first plate back and the second was nearly as bad  Dry burger and cold fries  No wonder the place was nearly empty  would not recommend and it wasnt cheap 
R0054,This was our third time visiting this place  and the service was disgraceful  I had booked a table and the waitress had to set a table as it wasnt ready even thought the restaurant was not busy so it took at least 10 minutes to seat us  No drinks menu was presented to us i had to request when ordering our food   The waitress who seemed to be working in our area was too busy chatting to staff and it took a glare from me to have her take our order  The drinks came out and had no carbonation in them at all so we had to give them back with not even an apology from the waiter  I ordered a bottle of water and that came with no class of ice  The chicken wings where ok  we ate them as we where hungry  Overall very very poor and disappointing service 
R0054,Very expensive not great value for poor quality food had to send back two burgers as they were burnt disappointed with the whole experience will not be back    Much prefer the temple bar venue
R0054,Very plain food with over expensive prices  Would not go back  Terrible value for money 
R0054,Waited 35 minutes for our starter then it  was another 30 minutes no sign of main course  Had to ask for it  My husband had pasta totally dried up  Staff friendly but four differant members of staff served our table so no one knew what they were doing  Totally overpriced for quality of food  Will not be recommending this restaurant 
R0054,We attended as a family of 4 for Fathers Day  there was a lovely atmosphere but understandably it was busy   We were seated promptly and our order taken   The starter of wings arrived very quickly  they appear to be able to produce multiple amounts of these very quickly which is great   Thereafter things went downhill  the waitress never came near us after our starter was delivered   We waited 40 mins for the mains to come  two of the dinners arrived  both luke warm and one without the side   The two were almost finished eating before the remaining two dishes arrived  again luke warm and the steak not cooked as requested i e  it was well done rather than medium   For one starter and 4 main meals with some drinks it cost  Euro 130  which is not particularly cheap   I feel we would have received higher quality warm food for less in Eddie Rockets or a pizzeria   It was a very disappointing experience  with the staff not tuned into looking after their allocated tables 
R0054,We were very disappointed with our meal we were heading to the cinema so made sure to order as soon as we got in but still it took nearly an hour to get our main courses and I think we only got them at that stage after asking for them  When they arrived they were also disappointing the seafood pasta was not hot to the extent you would be uncomfortable eating it and the steak was over cooked and the chips undercooked but as we were so late getting it we could not send it back just had to leave it and get popcorn at the movies   Must say our waitress was very pleasant and she did her best to get the food out when we reminded it had not come  Was disappointed as had been really looking forward to trying this restaurant out with lots of fond memories of the temple street branch
R0054,"We were waiting for an hour and half for our mains after our starter  The waitress was apologetic but it was still 10 00 before we got our mains  table was for 8 00  
As a result we were very late for our booking"
R0054,"Will never go back 
Brought chicken wings over and had to wait nearly ten mins for chips the chicken wings looked very pale  I asked 2 servers for the chips atleast five times  Wont be back "
R0055,"+ Good food and ambience  located in the heart of the city 
  However  made a reservation for 12 folks at noon and had to wait with all my guests for an additional half hour for the table to be ready   not a pleasant experience  whats the point in making a reservation to begin with  Waiters pretty dismissive when asked about the table  again a lack of good customer service 
  Moreover  we were told only at the very end when we were about to pay that they can only accept payment from 2 cards  After some pushback we were able eventually to all pay separately   might consider telling this to large group of people from the beginning "
R0055,Absolutely gorgeous  great atmosphere and very enjoyable to eat in  food is delicious would highly recommend 
R0055,"After more than a year of holding out  we FINALLY broke down and ordered food from this place  I set very realistic expectations so when I collected my food  I was only looking for an average  3 star meal 

What I did not expect was a cold and utterly tasteless pizza  We had ordered the Melanzane which was topped with the usual  pizza sauce and mozzarella  as well as marinated aubergine and basil  Our house is literally a 3 minute walk from here so the only way I could fathom it being so cold  would be if I carried the pizza with the lid open for the whole walk home  Hoping for a little salvation  we heated it up and attempted to eat it  There was no flavour  All I could taste was chewy pizza dough  If it werent for the texture of the cheese and aubergine I would have sworn that I was eating plain  greasy bread 

In addition to the pizza we had ordered a chicken Caesar salad  The chicken tasted okay but I am at a loss for what sauce they tried to pass as Caesar dressing  I tried eating a few bites with their ""dressing"" but ultimately had to toss it and use my own  

For me  this is the worst pizza I can remember eating  possibly anywhere  Huge pass "
R0055,Been several times   Wings are always great  Took burger this time   burnt to a cinder absolutely awful   was in a hurry to leave  and  with friends otherwise would have sent it back
R0055,Crowded and loud  service was slow  Would not recommend it anymore  The food was adequate but the volume was far too noisy to have any conversation 
R0055,Fantastic experience in here  Been coming here for over 25 years and it never disappoints  Service was superb  food delicious and we had a great family meal  Highly recommended 
R0055,"Food is overpriced for what it is  Ordered a bottle of wine and was overcharged for it on the final bill  Had to ask waiter to re check price and it was then deducted from bill  Wine was  Euro 40  but can be bought in shops for  Euro 6 50  checked this afterwords  

Main courses were nice but again completely overpriced  

Heavy service charge then added to bill after poor service to the table "
R0055,"Food was beautiful but sat down at 9 10 and  didnt receive our food till 10 30  
Took the goodness off the night with waiting around"
R0055,For the food we received I thought the price was very high and we were not given an itemize receipt 
R0055,Great chicken wings as always but similar to the last few occasions I have been there service could be better 
R0055,"I went down to collect my food from the restaurant and the lady at the counter was on the phone dealing with a complaint about cold food  Yet another warning bell that i ignored  I patiently waited for service but the lady just continued to answer the phone and fob me off by raising her finger at me  While I waited I noticed a bag full of food on the table next to me  I figured that could be my food left out  When she finally finished on the phone she asked what I wanted  I explained  �She took my money and gestured to the bag on the table  I left with the food feeling a little bit apprehensive about my purchase 

The food was crap to put it bluntly  The crispy batter vegetables and calamari were soggy and tasted like it had been microwaved  The spring rolls tasted like the frozen ones you can get in tesco  The satay skewers were way too chewy  The satay sauce looked diarrhea  �It tasted like peanut butter from lidl cut with oil  The sweet chilli sauce was just kind of like sugar syrup with red stuff floating in it  For my main meal I ordered duck  It was chewy and bland like chicken left under a hot lamp  The ""crispy noodles"" were like oily Styrofoam  My girlfriend got the Pad Khing with tofu  It was just a mess of tasteless vegetables and oily tofu  It was a tasteless MSG soup of crap  The rice was definitely reheated  The noodles were oily and had a weird taste to them  There was nothing really good in the entire meal "
R0055,I had booked a seat for nine people but the table was very uncomfortable  
R0055,"I love the food however the customer service is terrible  The waiters do not look happy at all
I completely understand that the restaurant is busy  but it is not reason for be rude with the customer 
I am very desapponted in my birthday night "
R0055,I loved the chicken wings  The spice was just purfect  We have made it a family tradition to go there every b day and Christmas 
R0055,"I would have always been a fan  Working in Croke Park when i was in college meant we had many many nights in here after match days 

Last night after a family event my uncle  my cousin  his girlfriend  and  i tried to get in together  and  we were pulled to the said for a talking to  We were refused for having had ""too much to drink"" and being an ""unfamiliar face""  I can tell you now with certainty i was sober  as was my cousins girlf  The boys had had a few drinks but were by no means drunk 

Funnily enough 2 different groups of taxis pulled up almost immediately after us  One full of boys who were also pulled to the side to be spoken to   and  one full of girls who were waved on without so much as a second glance from the bouncers  Disgraceful stuff  I wont be going back "
R0055,Ive just experienced one of the worst customer experiences Ive had in Dublin here this lunchtime  I waited in the queue for 15 full minutes without being served and when I stepped up to the till  I was ignored for a further 2 minutes before I turned and walked out  when I saw that at least 4 orders had still not even gone to the kitchen  My lunch break is only a half hour 
R0055,Its all about the food 
R0055,Me and some friends ordered pizza late at night because we had not eaten any dinner  3 of our pizzas came  they were ok  not very good but thats beside the point   however one of our friends pizza never made it and we thought it was just taking a little extra time because a lot of people queued in and ordered right after us  When we saw the group behind us get their pizza we confronted the cashier and pizza makers  They told our friend he never ordered a pizza and basically that we were a bunch of scammers even though he paid for 2 waters and a pizza which we all witnessed  The guys refused to make him his pizza which was so ridiculous  Avoid this place at all costs    
R0055,One main course was forgotten and then when it did come  it was incorrect leaving one diner eating alone  No apology and very little acknowledgment  Will not return 
R0055,"Personnal was very friendly 
A great moment with friends"
R0055,Quite disappointed  
R0055,Whilst the food was good we were very let down by service  Our drinks order was taken incorrectly on 3 occasions  we couldnt get their attention to get the bill  When we did  we had to go and remind them 10 minutes later  The food server was also incredibly grumpy when he was trying to find out who ordered the dish he had to hand  Not a good impression at all for the international colleagues I was hosting that night  They did deal with our complaint promptly and discounted the bill but it wasnt about the money
R0056,Atmosphere was dead  Place was half empty but service wasnt tentative/ quick  Food was okay but basic  Glass of wine was overpriced  Background noise wasnt pleasant  Not impressed and wouldnt bother returning 
R0056,"I had attempted to go here awhile back with my husband when we were in town for the day but got refused by the bouncers for some ridiculous reason  we were both stone cold sober  

Definitely will not be back "
R0056,"Waiter insisted on us ordering too much food  which we then couldnt finish  He then insisted we have dessert  This place is just trying to sell you food  not let you enjoy it   

Wagyu burger was burnt  I wasnt asked how I wanted it  

We were promised discount due to mixup in booking  but it was NOT applied  

Will not return "
R0057,"Amazing   
The food was just perfect  as was the service"
R0057,And she was talking as eating with food in her mouth  A little rude to me i thought 
R0057,"By chance   and another group of friends   we tried it again  On a Friday night we miraculously got a table  Yay  But they run out of menus  Ahhhh  15m to bring us one menu  only one for 4 of us 
"
R0057,"Couldnt agree more on this one  

Place is an over priced dump and the music is such trash it would give you a headache  �

Bouncers are a***holes and the bar man was so rude  

Horrible"
R0057,Exzellent Food  very friendly staff  Perfect Service
R0057,"Food was good  
Service was poor  
Our waiter forgot three items of our order  
The main dish was wrong and the waiter persuaded us to have the dish because of the time to cook the right order  No deduction off the bill   
The wine we first ordered was out of stock therefore we were given another wine but not at the same price but more expensive again nothing deducted off the bill 
 We were not given the opportunity to taste the wine it was just chucked in the glass  
The waiter who delivered the food was sarcastic "
R0057,Food was meh  price was average  but staff were rude  The girl working on Saturday night could not have been less pleasant  Not a single positive thing to say about her  Brusque  literally rolling her eyes while I tried to put in my order and monosyllabic questions peppered with grunts and sighs  
R0057,Great place  Came here for a family celebration and could not fault it  Staff were extremely helpful  attentive and friendly  Food was fantastic   
R0057,Great restaurant  Excellent food and service at very good prices for Dublin 
R0057,Great restaurant  The food was excellent and service was top notch  Definitely recommend this restaurant 
R0057,"I had a voucher so was looking forward to a dinning experience and some choice and large steaks 

We had booked 7 30   arrived 6 30 and only had the single choice of pre theater  

Cost wasnt an issue as I had a voucher but the value for the fare was awful   

The  Euro 8 supplement on to a two course meal   essentially a steak and ice cream was over  Euro 40 per head   Service added for a set menu with a table of 3   Seriously poor business call  

The food was fine   nothing special  
I asked could I pay extra for onion rings : not possible 
again poor business turning down additional income 

All in all   very inflexible  very poor value to the point of over priced   bar drinks   very fair price 

And in summary very disappointing and sadly could not recommend 

Appreciate your thoughts 

Paul"
R0057,I had lamb shoulder which was very very poor  The flavors did not work together at all and the lamb was so tough  My friend had rib eye which was not a rib eye just a very thin small piece of steak  It was Definitely not worth the price either so I will not be returningz
R0057,"I have never reviewed a a take away or any establishment online before but I had to open up an account here to warn you of this place 

Worst ever experience with a take away  Nothing wrong with delivery time and the driver was friendly but the food is absolutely dire  If you dont believe me look at a review on justeat  Out of an order for two items  main course and starter  the starter was not included even though I paid for it and gave a tip  I dont want to criticize the driver  dont blame the messenger  but this was the worst food I have ever tasted  For 16 euro I gave almost all of it to the wild cats outside  I know maybe harsh words but if you are looking for a good food I would strongly advise to avoid "
R0057,On the last occasion  I decided to opt for something else than the wings  how adventurous right    My seafood chowder was not haute cuisine  but did the trick  still my hunger   The service was a bit scattered really  Also the table was greasy and sticky  I asked the waitress if she could clean it   and even though she gave it a wipe  the table remained very sticky  EW 
R0057,I told the manager who assured me all orders are cooked to order and it must be my senses  Unreal �and condescending to say the least
R0057,I went to this restaurant on two occasions  the first time I had a great experience  but on the second time  which was on New Years Eve  unfortunately left a lot to be desired  the service was time consuming  and confusing  the menu options were exhausted  I would recommend this restaurant for normal dates  not on holidays or special dates as they do not know how to handle a high volume of people 
R0057,Id recommend them for the food only  The service was shocking  We had to go up to the waiter  and  ask him for the alternative menu after failing to get his attention for over 5 minutes   and  again we had to go up to place our order  No offer to see if we wanted drinks  Something again we had to go out of our way to ask for  Not good for lunch time when we are conscious of time 
R0057,Me and my wife came here for dinner  pre theatre   we ordered the three course  The salmon was OK  but the so called rib eye steak was terrible  it was so tough and dry that we both left the majority of it on the dish  Then when the waiter arrived to collect the dishes he asked how we liked the steak  when it was obvious that something was not right  I told him our opinion and he just shugged his shoulders and left with the dishes  The icecream for desert was good  but we had to wait for it a long time  the coffee that we ordered with the icecream was cold by the time it arrived 
R0057,Myself and my Wife attended for a meal last Saturday night  We like to try different places to eat  I dont normally complain but the food I thought was over priced for what we got  I had the Beef Carpacchio with goats cheese for a starter at  Euro 14  where was the goats cheese and rocket   My partner had the scallops at  Euro 16 and there was only a few on the plate and there was very little taste   For the mains I had the Rib eye at  Euro 29 and my partner had the fillet at  Euro 34  It came with a few chips  that were put in what looked like a large egg cup and the chips were over cooked  The pepper sauce was lovely and the meat was cooked very well to our liking  We had a lovely bottle of Rioja   The service was very good  The ambiance was all good as there were many French in town and In the restaurant  probably for the Rugby match the following day   You had a Brazilian girl at front of house that had difficulty in conversing in English  I think overall If youre going to try and get customers into town and visit your restaurant on a Saturday night  you need to offer better food or simply upgrade the food and give better value for money  Is not the cheapest or the easiest places to get to   Overall the experience was not that bad  you just need to give the customer better value for their money 
R0057,Oh dear reallybad attempt at doing the Burger  I mean how hard can it be  I got chatting to the Chinese owner  oh dear  nice laddoh pity about the food    Booooring
R0057,Omg  this place is fantastic  beautifully prepared and delicious food  The staff  couldnt be more helpful 
R0057,On vacation here in Dublin  Chow mein was good  as was the kung pow and salmon sashimi however the wings and ribs were horrible  They forgot to give us our rolls 
R0057,"One of the waiters we had  had a bad manner  very arrogant and unfriendly  poor customer service   
The dinner menu was very overpriced for how it tasted  One of our sides was a tomato salad  it was a big bowl of green salad leaves with at most 2 small tomatoes inside  absolutely terrible considering it is a �tomato� salad   Ambience and interior was very nice  Overall   would NOT recommend and will NOT come back "
R0057,Over priced for what we got  Starter and dessert were very disappointing  We got the smoked salmon to start which was just a slice of smoked salmon and half a slice of bread  We got the cherry  and  almond tart for dessert which was more of a sponge than a tart and extremely dry  I got the rib eye steak for main which was nice  my partner got the beef cheek which was mediocre  Overall disappointing for the price we paid  Service was adequate but without a smile 
R0057,Perfect for our last night in Ireland
R0057,Picked it to celebrate our wedding anniversary  which turned out to be a bad choice  the venue not the partner  Food tasted like it was made in a big cafeteria     disappointing 
R0057,"Reservation at 5 15pm  Only pre theatre menu available  no a la carte  No Pinot Grigio available  Two out of 6 people ordered a main course with potatoes and we were advised they ran out of mashed potatoes for pre theatre menu at 6pm   
Cappuccino delivered stone cold  Very poor service  would not return or recommend to a friend  Most disappointing"
R0057,Sadly we were not told there was only the option of a per theatre menu as we would not have booked if we had known  As we had eaten there before we were really looking forward to the meal and were disappointed at the quality of the menu options the rib eye steak was served with chips and a plain green salad not at all to the standard of past meals sadly   As it was a special occasion we were disappointed 
R0057,Service a little slow however well worth the wait Fantastic food and very nice staff
R0057,Service was slow  had to ask for items twice on more than one occasion  one main meal had to be sent back and waited 20 min at least for replacement to arrive  over charged on Bill and had to question what we were charged for  In the end we were over charged by over  Euro 40 on a pre theatre menu for 2 people  A complimentary glass of wine was given for one person and was a different wine to what my wife was drinking originally  All in all I would not go back again and would not recommend it to others on my experience
R0057,Super authentic roasted duck  Trip back to Hong Kong  Love it and will keep on visiting
R0057,The ambiance  and  food was wonderful  The decor was unique as it resembled an underground wine cellar  The service lacked  and  our server after taking our order never re appeared  We were looking forward to viewing the dessert menu but gave up as our server was nowhere to be found  We were disappointed as we read so many favorable reviews 
R0057,The menu is very limited  we asked to order from the bar bites menu  and  were told no  not for lunch  We asked to order burgers  and  were told no  even though we had seen a number of tables with burgers  and  potato fries  The food was sandwiches with sweet potato wedges  and  side salad  The sandwiches seemend to have been made  and  toasted earlier in the day even the day before  the cheese had melted  and  gone hard  and  bread was soggy  Sweet potato wedges  was 3 soggy wedges  The side salad was a large salad when it arrived   and  when queried  a number of times if the right salad had been brought as it was so big we were told yes  When paying the bill we had been charged for a large salad and not the side salad despite asking multiple times if it was the right one  The waitress then messed up the rest of the bill   it took 20 mins to pay  and  leave  Would not reccomend at all 
R0057,"The deserts were lovely but standard stuff you would get in a pub served on a fancy plate  
Overall it was basically a good tapas style Italian which is insanely overpriced  "
R0057,The food was delicious  they took our order very fast and they were very friendly  Definitely recommend if youd like to try traditional irish
R0057,The food was ok but they charged 5e for 2 tiny scoop of vanilla ice cream for a 2 year old
R0057,"The food was very poor for the price  
Very much canteen type food  Chicken breast  baby potatoes  raw brussels in broth  Tasteless  
Pre theatre should be  Euro 22 25 max  Table beside us complained also "
R0057,The place was almost empty yet the service was terrible   worst Ive had in Dublin in a long time   we had to order drinks twice before we got them and my 2 year old nephew was given a coffee instead of the hot chocolate that he ordered  They said it was a decaf but who knows and we got no apology  No one asked how our service was and we were automatically charged 12 5 percent on our bill    I would not hurry back 
R0057,The server was extremely rude and wouldnt come to take orders or payment  We were a big group and were left with no drinks several times  making us go all the way to the bar  The place wasnt even too busy 
R0057,The service was poor and the food not worth the money  It is a very noisy  roudy place on a week end night 
R0057,The venue  atmosphere  service and food are quite good  still a bit overpriced from my point of view  However  nice place to spend summer noons  Thanks
R0057,Unimpressed unfortunately 
R0057,Very disappointing experience before going to see Andrea Boccelli I had booked on line and never did it mention that it was a set menu for pre theatre Very limiting choices  my daughter joined us for dinner who is a vegetarian she had one choice of mains which she did not like we enquired about getting a pizza  and were told it was a set menu until 7pm but they would ask the chef pizza was been served upstairs in the bar so not to sure why it was such a big deal  We made our choices and both myself and my Husband ordered the gin infused salmon for starters  this arrived 2 thin slices with orange segments a slice of brown bread would not go a miss Mains were cod roast chicken vegetarian choice and Rib eye steak which was 8 euro extra which is excessive when you are paying 27 52  euro for two courses or 32 50 for 3 courses Our mains were the cod which arrived swimming in a sauce with the rice floating at the bottom surrounded by a few mussels no sides we ordered some fries as we were starving 5 euro a bowl Our younger Daughter ordered the chicken dish which she was happy with I ordered a glass of wine which was 8 75 euro very expensive Overall it was a bad experience and extremely bad value for what we had cannot help think that because of its prime location the customer does not always come first Unfortunately we will not be returning and could not recommend to friends or family 
R0057,Very limited and not very exciting menu   It was a pre theatre menu but still a bit uninspiring   I ordered a roast chicken meal     I NEVER order chicken when out  but nothing else appealed to me   Food was grand  tasted pleasant  nothing to complain about really  Just a bit boring   Didnt even bother with desserts as choices terrible   Wouldnt go back again 
R0057,Very poor options for vegans and vegetarians  Very poor value for money 
R0057,Very very noisy and a table of drunk people behind us at 6:30 making a hell of a racket  We were only offered the pre theatre menu that was limited  Wont be back 
R0057,We arrived at 5pm with a set menu  Three choices and nothing else  We had 3 teenagers and the choice was abissmal  We asked for plain pasta which was not on the menu  The chef was not prepared to cook it  My daughter asked for toppings on her pizza  Again the chef said no  Our waiter had poor English which made communicating very difficult  The only thing good was it was close to the train station  Next time I will travel further
R0057,"We booked a table for 21:30 and they didnt have any ready for us until 22:15 
They had a closed menu where half of the mains were not available 
Food was ok but not excellent 
It didnt meet our expectations at all "
R0057,We felt rushed and the quality of the food was very poor for the price of it
R0057,We ordered ribeye steaks  It was quite poor  both the meat and the grilling 
R0057,Worst restaurant ever  Awful service  bad food  waste of time 
R0058,Always consistently good  Food  wine and service fantastic   They run a great  place 
R0058,Always love this place    food  wine  service is consistently great 
R0058,And a very cute sommilier   
R0058,Awesome little cafe restaurant outside of our BNB  definitely the place to get a latte and an Irish Breakfast 
R0058,Best dining experience we had in a while  Great food  great ambience  great service  Would definitely recommend  
R0058,Booking through the app  not anticipated when calling the restaurant  led to Bank of Ireland putting a precautionary stop on my credit card    serious nuisance in the week before Christmas
R0058,Disappointing  The crab cakes were unrecognisable as crabcakes  they   there was only 1 small one per serving  were dry with no flavour  served  overstatement  on a side plate with a tiny  tiny amount of garnish and dressing  the burger was dry  though I did order it well done  no sauce or relish on the side  the fries were good  Standards have slipped  have eaten there many times  this was not one of the better ones
R0058,Every time we dine here the food  and  service just get better Gianni  and  the staff are always eager to please  
R0058,Excellent service and outstanding food  Already looking forward to our next visit   
R0058,"Food was mediocre and extremely limited choice  I ordered the lamb  unfortunately duck was off the menu  and it was utterly tasteless  All four of us chose differently but we were all equally unimpressed  The noise levels in the restaurant made conversation at our table difficult  I remembered frequenting this place years back when food was delicious and it had a good ambience  I wont be rushing back 
Good wine list is about all it has going for it "
R0058,Great food with an amazing selection of wines  Atmosphere was very nice with fantastic staff  Highly recommended 
R0058,Great place for breakfast  lunch and dinner   Fantastic food  Great service and very friendly staff  Will be going back again and again 
R0058,Had seafood main course   Very poor 
R0058,Had very nice lunch for table of 7 ladies  Waiter very friendly food good but  unfortunately one member of bar staff had a very bad attitude and as a result of this none of the group would be prepared to go to this bar and restaurant again   Regretfully we were not the only patrons who had this bad experience with this member of staff as his bad attitude was being discussed by numerous clients in bar area 
R0058,I found the food tasty but very small portions  and seemed a bit like starters than main courses 
R0058,I had the worst onion rings ever  the tap water tasted like plastic and a bad milkshake 
R0058,It got very stuffy and hot downstairs as the evening went on  Main course very good  Wine always great  Dessert underwhelming  Overall very enjoyable
R0058,It was for our daughter Phoebes birthday and it was superb
R0058,"Loved the food  Great spot for a special night out   I took my wife here for her birthday and we both loved it 

Will be back "
R0058,Loved this cafe   Please visit  They are sublime  Everything was delicious  Staff super friendly 
R0058,Lovely comfortable venue   Food always good and service great  Friendly staff 
R0058,"Lovely quirky place 
Busy good food menu and lots of choice of drink 
Service was Perfect super friendly and helpful"
R0058,My friend and I were greeted  to a wonderful welcome  I had the Falafel Burger and a Smoothie  All was delicious  Price was most reasonable too 
R0058,New Years Eve
R0058,Premises is amazing  staff are ab lovely and food is exquisite couldnt recommend more cant wait to go back
R0058,The salad was  as I should have guessed  very disappointing
R0058,Unfortunately the service we experienced was poor  we were waiting 35 minutes to order food and couldnt get anyones attention to order  Nobody came to check if our food was ok until after we had finished and we were very delayed getting the bill as nobody would come over to us  We also then had a long wait for the credit card machine  For these reasons I wouldnt be back even though the food was quite nice 
R0058,Very comfortable seating  great service  food was excellent 
R0058,"Very loud music on entering premises 
Expected to be seated downstairs but was given table upstairs in s pretty drab room 
Average meal which included an overpriced rib eye steak with very little trimmings 
Wouldnt go back to what is an overpriced cafe bar with no ambience but good staff"
R0058,We met a couple of friends  wine bar for smart but casual dinner   Overall food was very good however we were seated downstairs in the corner of the basement restaurant   In some ways it was an ideal table for a private dinner with good friends however the music blasting from a speaker above our heads somewhat curtailed us   We didnt have any starters instead had an aperitif   We ordered both red and white bottles of moderately priced wine with dinner and had 2 deserts/cheeseboards and coffee to finish   Our bill came to over  Euro 340 for 4 people which in my view is very over priced for what we had   There are many better restaurants with offer deals that will attract us in the future   Unfortunately although we enjoyed the food we will not return at these prices 
R0058,We regularly go here  for lunch so were really looking forward to our evening visit  The menu was very limited and confusing and the food a little disappointing given how good the lunchtime menu and food are  The � Cod Special� was more of a starter rather than a main  the price a little steep for what it was and my two fellow diners commented that it tasted very bland  Not all wine on the wine list was available  The staff as usual were very friendly and the decor apart from the lighting is very good   The table was quite cramped and very near the door drawing a draft when the door opened to admit other diners given that we were the only diners on the ground floor  Overall our visit was quite disappointing which is such as a pity as we are regular lunchtime diners   Told a colleague about our experience and they are thinking of cancelling their visit in March
R0058,We were late due to traffic and the staff were very accomodating    We had to wait over 30 mins for our main courses   we didnt have appetizers   My burger was medium rare instead of medium and the waiter did bring it back to the kitchen  he was very helpful   I didnt enjoy the bacon jam  the texture and look was offputting to me I would ask for plain the next time    I like the place have been there many times with friends was dissappointed with this visit but I would go back again 
R0058,"When we eventually managed to order our steaks and they arrived 2 out of 3 of them were undercooked  We asked the male waiter with the ponytail to get them
cooked a little more and he challenged us as if we did not understand what rare and
medium rare was  Customer not always right apparently 
The young girl and male french waiter who also served us were both very good and wine was excellent 
4th time in the restaurant and definitely not one I would like to remember 
Very disappointed to honest "
R0058,Wonderful experience with great attentive staff and an excellent wine list at fair prices 
R0059,Amazing braised beef ravioli  I also had the tiramisu for dessert and it was divine  The service is friendly and quick  and the atmosphere was great 
R0060,Always a great experience  We were 40 minutes early for our reservation and they accommodated us with a table without hesitation  Great staff
R0060,Amazing bar man  Super service and hosting  Cocktails were great  Fun atmosphere  Looked after us for the whole night and was much appreciated  Will be back 
R0060,Apart from its Great Food   and  my Wheat Beer on tap  this pub is cosy and brilliant fabulous staff willing to help you  
R0060,Excellent service delicious flatbreads and very nice ambiance
R0060,Fabulous  Went to the cocktail bar then for tapas   food was exquisite  ambience great  staff very accommodating despite being busy  Will be back 
R0060,Food and drinks are lovely but service was slow and we had to go up to order drinks
R0060,Great cocktails  and  service
R0060,Great cocktails and atmosphere
R0060,Great cocktails  very busy  good atmosphere  manager was run off his feet but in fairness was doing a great job 
R0060,Great fish and chips  Near Temple bar and quick service  Small seating area  but the food comes in an almost takeout box if needed 
R0060,"Great place for lunch  Not the typical bar food you can find everywhere  Chili beef pie not too hot; rather ""comfortable "" "
R0060,I didnt care for the food here  The sushi rice was poorly cooked and too mushy for proper sushi  The atmosphere was nice  but servers were very slow 
R0060,I had the vegetarian falafel burger and it was delicious  The ingredients were so fresh and everything was very flavorful  Service was polite and we received our food promptly 
R0060,I was not impressed at all with the menu we were offered  There were four of us  We went for two sharing plates and four sides  We got two small main courses to be shared between four  The side of seasonal veg turned out to be four pieces of tenderstem broccoli  I dont eat dairy or eggs and when I asked for a suitable dessert  They gave me a bowl of grapes and what looked like a tin of fruit salad  It was 8 euro for 12 grapes dont get me wrong  I enjoy fine dining and unusual food but was not in anyway impressed 
R0060,Including outside seating for the cocktail bar is very misleading  If I wanted to sit outside amongst the smokers I would have requested that in my booking 
R0060,Loved the hot soup on a cold day after touring    my husband had the haggis and he loved it    Bartenders were really sweet 
R0060,Rated as one of the top places to eat in Dublin  It has everything to be proud of  Got the early bird menu and one thing that stabds out regarding the food is the steak  The onion rings and the mash with the steak made it one of the tastiest in Dublin  Beautiful decor and amazing staff made the dinner even more amazing  The a la carte might look expensive but the steaks here are worth the money  Dessert was exceptional too   Overall a great place for a date night or an anniversary night 
R0060,Really good cocktail menu  Excellent knowledge from the bar staff  Highly recommended 
R0060,Service was really bad  not much staff on for how busy it was  When we were seated we werent given menus or told the deals for the day and how we could order food or drinks because some tables had table service while others had to go and order at the bar 
R0060,This was my second time to visit here and it didnt disappoint second time round   We went on a Saturday night and it was booked to capacity as is the case every Saturday
R0060,Tried to order a flatbread as Id seen these advertised on the online menu  We were informed however that they can only be ordered outside as they are too big for the table and too messy   Suffice to say we took our business elsewhere 
R0060,"We had a wonderful time catching up on Sunday   4 friends who have not seen each other for a long time   We had the best service from the girl who served us our food and drinks   What a wonderful person to have on your team   smiley; efficient; pleasant; non intrusive   Top class service   The food was also really delicious and the cocktails very different and unusual   Great atmosphere   Highly recommended   One thing about your upstairs bar   the service up there was terrible   The disinterest and boredom of the staff is palpable   A complete contrast to the staff downstairs   Our server was unfriendly and made faces at our choice of drink order   She also spent a lot of time checking out her hair in the mirrors on the wall   Not a good impression   Lowers the good perception of an otherwise fantastic day   
Give the girl in the Tapas restaurant a raise "
R0060,When my wife arrived to take her pre booked table in which she had to use a credit card to guarantee she was shown to a barrel with 1 chair not 3 in the smoking area  The staff member looked at the situation and my wife asked to be moved which wasnt possible so asked for extra seats  Fine she said and my wife never saw that staff member again  My wife and her 2 friends found their placement completely unsatisfactory however remained on due to having a dinner reservation in the tapas bar  We wont mention how the waitress in the tapas bar got the order wrong and tried to say that they had ordered the wrong amount  Anyway my wife and her friends will certainly not be having cocktails at  Euro 10 50 a drink while  standing at a barrel with smokers surrounding them again 
R0061,Always great food  and  service  The hostess Maria is just outstanding  
R0061,Amazing place with great food  We were served by Bruno which delivered a fantastic service  I highly recommend and definitely will come back 
R0061,Great for vegetarians too  Highly recommend it
R0061,Best place I have eaten in Dublin  Great for vegetarians too  Highly recommend it
R0061,Delicious  amazing service and beautiful people 
R0061,Excellent food  Excellent wine  recommend the Barbera DAlba  Lovely service with a fantastic menu 
R0061,Excellent small plates in a superb setting and location  I highly recommend it 
R0061,Friendly staff  food and wine delicious  Excellent vegetarian options 
R0061,Great breakfast  Fresh and fast  Great service  Porridge and baked eggs with mushrooms  and  tomato  Yum 
R0061,Great evening  Lovely food  Menu explained well  Thank you 
R0061,Great food and service
R0061,I had a minor problem and the staff was terrific and quickly resolved the issue   Love that 
R0061,I recommend  Go in a group and tell the waiter to create a sorted tapas for you  It is fantastic 
R0061,If they have the truffle pasta its a must get but honestly everything we had was amazing from drinks all the way to dessert  Highly Highly recommend 
R0061,"The food is all about flavour  Amazing flavours 
Great service  no rush "
R0061, Grand  Came here for an anniversary as had one of our first dates here  Mix of tapas   creamy mushrooms would have benefited from another type of fungi  the texmex stuffed pepper was ordered purely for nostalgia and was as blah as we remembered  fairly tasteless  Pudding to scallop ratio was disappointing but the chorizo and prawns tapa was tasty  Pimientos de padron were salty as they should be  Crepe dessert had far too much  HB  ice cream  would have preferred more sauce and fruit  Wouldnt be back in a hurry
R0061,10 minutes to get a menu  20 minutes to get our drinks  Didnt get everything we ordered and then got the bill including these items then brought the bill again but it hadnt been rectified  Some of food was only Luke warm too  Bad experience overall
R0061,"A great place with a warning 

I recommend this place for a drink  Pop in  enjoy the wonderful ridiculousness of literally drinking in a church whose pews have been converted into a serving station 

But dont eat here  The prices are very high for very limited options  and if you look to reduce your price a bit by sharing a place etc the staff will be relentlessly rude to you  I dont think theres an excuse for treating people as badly as the staff treated us  so the best way to save your money here is to skip it and let staff keep that attitude to themselves 

But definitely a fun place for 1 drink "
R0061,A very disappointing experience  The padron peppers  a dish weve had many times at other tapas restaurants  were inedible with a tough skin that was most unpleasant  When we complained we were at first offered a replacement but then another waiter tried to explain to us that it was just how they were cooked and that the next batch would likely be the same  Im guessing the chef didnt take too kindly to the complaint  Unfortunately there was no real improvement with the rest of the tiny  pretentious and massively overpriced dishes that followed  Coffee was good though  although it took about 20 mins to arrive  and not with our dessert  Disappointment was not the only thing we felt when leaving  we were still feeling hungry  Its safe to say we wont be returning but if fashionable and trendy is what youre after and youre not all that bothered about good food then youre in the right spot 
R0061,Absolutely delicious small plates  Excellent service  Highly recommend if you are visiting Dublin 
R0061,Always a great sign when a restaurant is consistently busy  Super atmosphere and tasty food  make sure everyone likes Parmesan and hollandaise  my  friend didnt  which limits the options a little  but service was fantastic and would highly recommend 
R0061,always a huge fan of this place   you never disappoint 
R0061,Always buzzing  friendly atmosphere with a perpetual air of anticipation and the food never disappoints      beautifully presented  cooked to perfection and great portions   Its also a BYOB which adds to this hidden wee gem of a place  
R0061,Always reliably excellent   truffle pasta is  irresistible 
R0061,Amaaaazing   Quality price amazing    
R0061,Amazing food and service  Great Cocktails   Would go back again 
R0061,Amazing food and venue would definitely eat here again 
R0061,Amazing meal and service 
R0061,Amazing service  very personal and we loved every single dish 
R0061,Amazing tasty food   great service and brilliant atmosphere  
R0061,Amazing  Great food and amazing service 
R0061,As usual a great night with excellent food and service to match
R0061,As with other places  I felt the menu was packed with interesting concepts and fresh ideas  but the actual tastiness of the food left a lot to be desired  Of the 10 12 small plates we ordered  only one  the pork belly/hamburger  had a real yum factor  My soft shell crabs  cant go wrong huh   were a case in point: a little too much spice in the batter  a little too much coating  and the flavour of the crabs was overpowered  Cod cheeks were big fish fingers  and less tasty than Donegal Catch  Its a shame cos the menu is genuinely exciting  the service is good  and the place is not bad value  but there are much  much better establishments in terms of flavour and reliability 
R0061,"At first it seems very nice  but the food was dissapointing  Way too salty and everything was either fried  The worst is the smell  since they fry most dishes  the whole place stinks  My wife and I also left smelling like a deep fryer  and the street smells oil  I dont understand how the neighborhood allows that place tu run with such ineffective exhaust 

The service was fast and nice  and the decor also good "
R0061,Food was tasty but way over priced and very very poor value for money  Will not go back and was disappointed that I have selected this restaurant for mainly out of town business guests 
R0061,Booked for business meal for 8 people  totally dis interested and non attentive service  it was busy but that could not justify the service  when I asked for tapas to arrive so that each person had something to eat  I  was advised that tapas are only served as they are ready  this meant that one dinner guest had to sit and watch most of the group eat  while they had no service  this single tapas eventually came to the table about 10 mins after everyone else had finished eating   Food was tasty but way over priced and very very poor value for money  Will not go back and was disappointed that I have selected this restaurant for mainly out of town business guests 
R0061,Booked in for 6 15 and there was no table for us  We were given some one elses table which was fine  Our orders were taken quickly but we were waiting 50 mins for the good to arrive  My boyfriend ordered the fries with bacon and onion but when it came out there was neither bacon nor onion in it  I mentioned it to the waiter and he brought out another one but it came out long after the rest of our dishes and still had nothing on it except the Parmesan on top  During our 2 hours there I had one glass of wine and it was impossible to get the staffs attention to ask for another because they were so busy  In the end we decided desert was going to be too much of a struggle and just left feeling very disappointed 
R0061,Brill service   perfect for a date or to meet friends  
R0061,Brilliant  Fabulous food  amazing cocktails and lovely staff  Always come back each time Im in Dublin  Highly recommend 
R0061,By accident we went there for dinner tonight: fantastic food in fantastic atmosphere  both  provided by fantastic humans  Simply 1st choice 
R0061,Celebrating our fathers 70th bday  Amazing food and service 
R0061,Cocktails and tapas here whilst visiting Dublin�unreal     Unmissable  Book a table NOW 
R0061,Decent atmosphere  Huge portions that you can split in most cases  The goat cheese salad was delicious and the truffle fries are worth having 
R0061,Delicious cocktails  tasty tapas  highly recommend pork belly and truffle pasta  and friendly staff  Will be back 
R0061,Delicious food and fantastic atmosphere   Will be back every soon 
R0061,Delicious food and great service  would definitely go again
R0061,Delicious tapas   I tried the pork belly  duck rolls and praline donuts  Yum  It was cozy  lively and warm spirited 
R0061,Did not match the standard of our last visit  We felt rushed and thought the servers cleared away the plates etc far to quickly  on one occasion we had to tell the server it wasnt finished and not to take it aways they apologised   The food as ever was fine  Didnt stay for after meal drinks  Will give the restaurant a go next time in Dublin 
R0061,Didnt stay for after meal drinks  Will give the restaurant a pass next time in Dublin 
R0061,Didnt enjoy our food
R0061,"Didnt seat us in this place even though that is where I booked  when i told them that they just said that they served the same food upstairs in the restaurant  which completely missed the point of going to a tapas bar 
I had been prepared for the fact that it was probably overpriced and that the portions where not good but even going in armed with that i was still shocked  Add to the standard was just fair  
Would not recommend at all  I dont mind paying that bit more for an experience but this was really    underwhelming "
R0061,Disappointing overrated  wont go again
R0061,Do people actually like the food here  Or are they just highly rated because it is one of the only fully vegetarian restaurants in Dublin  I have had better salads from the ready meal section at super markets  This place is certainly not helping the stereotype that vegan food is bland crunchy granola slop 
R0061,During a week long stay in Dublin  we dined at here twice  its that good  The tapas format works well with all age groups   we were a party of uni students and parents  The quality of the food is top notch   everything super fresh and perfectly balanced  Its *not* the greatest for vegetarians or vegans though  The second night we went it was my last night in Dublin   No easy feat   All of our dishes were delicious  but I highly recommend the duck spring rolls  the foie gras burger  the truffle pasta and the shoftshell crab  Cocktails were wonderful and inventive  Definitely recommend 
R0061,"Every time I come here I get the pad thai  And every time after taking my first bite  I wish I hadnt  

Flavourless and unforgivably greasy  I feel sick every time  

Why do I come here  Well  thats a good question  At five euro for a student  though theyve raised it to five fifty  it is a cheap way to get full  And unfortunately sometimes  the needs of your pocket  outweigh those of your stomach 

Avoid if you can; this is my last time I swear  "
R0061,Excellent   food  atmosphere and service all very good  Its not cheap but well worth it 
R0061,Excellent evening  Fantastic food  atmosphere and the waiting staff were superb  Highly recommend it 
R0061,Excellent experience all round delicious food  fancy cocktails and lovely ambience 
R0061,Excellent experience tonight   great food  great atmosphere  great service 
R0061,Excellent food  cocktails and service  Cant wait to get back 
R0061,Excellent from beginning to end
R0061,Excellent quality of food  Portion size ridiculously small  Poor value for money 
R0061,Excellent spot to get small but really tasty tapas  Amazing wine list also
R0061,Extremely disappointed that the menu had changed and there was so little choice versus what would have been available previously   We were not told about the brunch specials which would have suited one of our group who did not have a good experience due to the limited selection available   It is a very different from 6 months ago and not for the better 
R0061,Extrem good Food  Tried it once and went 3 more times while staying in Dublin  I recommend it a lot and thats coming from a person who criticizes every single thing 
R0061,Extremely expensive for amount of food you get   Im aware its a tapas bar but 16 euro for three chickpea chips and 24 for three pieces of duck is a bit much 
R0061,"It was a but let down here  

Overall  great place  great staff  the food is nice  but not enough of it for the price "
R0061,Fantastic food and service  A visit well worth the trip to Dublin 
R0061,Fantastic food  Every mouthful full of flavours  Will definitely go back again  Great experience 
R0061,Fav restaurant love everything about it
R0061,"Flavours are outstanding  Each dish is a perfect little size so dont be afraid to order 2/3 for yourself  Between a group of people its a great way to sample many dishes  

There is a great buzz in the Gastro part of this restaurant  The open kitchen makes for great viewing if you are able to sit at the bar stools facing it  The staff are really friendly and exceptionally professional  The small little details in the service are what really make the difference and everything is done with super knowledge and a big smile  You can tell there is a fantastic team spirit and excellent management in place  

I thoroughly enjoyed my experience  and cant wait for my next dining experience there  I would highly recommend to all "
R0061,Food  and  service were both top notch  Will definitely be back very soon 
R0061,Food amazing  Extremely rushed and food thrown at us in a bid to get us out as soon as possible  Very disappointed
R0061,Food and service were wonderful   Fun place to go and try lots of different bites 
R0061,Food is very imaginative and tasty  Staff always very friendly and efficient 
R0061,Food only Ok  very small portions  expensive for what it was   deserts were disappointing  
R0061,"Food sound great but overall is a let down  The meats and fish are good but the veg and accompany sides are poor  
The seats are the most uncomfortably I have ever experienced  Too low to the ground if you are over 5ft tall "
R0061,Food was amazing  And staff very efficient  We request a wine change as it seemed like was open for while and the waitress exchange it without a fuss  Highly Recommended
R0061,"Food was average  We chose the early bird menu  We then needed to order extra dishes a la carte as the food was insufficient 
"
R0061,"Service was forgetful 
CHECK YOUR BILL CAREFULLY  Drinks were added to the bill that were supposed to be included  I pointed this out and they then fixed the bill "
R0061,Food was good but we were very disappointed by the service
R0061,Food was good  Table seating was awful  We sat in the center on a pommel horse  Service was sub par  Waiter basically ignored us 
R0061,Food was innovative and delicious  Portions werent very big but came away full  Staff and atmosphere very nice 
R0061,Food was ok  bit gimmicky and quite pricey for what you get  Seated at what seemed like a main junction and quite an uncomfortable dining experience with very loud music blasting out and people wandering around standing over you and generally making the whole evening unpleasant 
R0061,Food was stale  dry  over heated  sauces had too much sugar and salt  in them  never going there again
R0061,Food was very disappointing  lacked flavour  When we complained about food  it was handled well and we were offered free deserts which was nice  However wouldnt recommend for food  much better food available elsewhere
R0061,"Food was very good  but service was ""okay"" at best "
R0061,Food was very mediocre  Read better on the menu but did not deliver  Very small portions and overpriced for what was delivered  Would not rush back  Toilets are nice and clean  Menu layout a little confusing  maybe too many different fonts used  Nice venu but for me it was more style and show over substance 
R0061,For our dessert we both ordered the creme brulee  We had wanted to order the Nutella brioche pudding but they were sold out  But thankfully the creme brulee was pretty much perfect  silky smooth and nicely vanilla d 
R0061,From start to finish a great evening  The food is as always unbelievable
R0061,From the food to the service  everything was excellent  The coddle was fantastic  as was the beef stew  If Im ever in Dublin again  I will definitely be back 
R0061,Bar menu is very fussy and over priced  I prefer the restaurant and while it is not cheap its better value  Have been a few times to this place but wont be going again for a while 
R0061,Good enough food for sure but dont use their napkins to wipe off any stains  I added a tip here as well  as the food was pretty good but do NOT use the red napkins to clean any stains or spills on your clothes  The napkin stained my pants  not the mole sauce that came out  New light grey denim ruined  Odd tip I know but hope they take note and change up the napkin supplier/quality 
R0061,Good clean food  Not a lot of salt  but lots of flavor  Had to wait for a table  but quick and friendly service  and fair prices 
R0061,Good food good service  Saturday lunchtime lovely buzz
R0061,Very noisy  and the potatoes that was ordered for the meat was brought in so late that the meat was either already eaten or cold  And they were out of ceviche  Which could happen anywhere but would have been nice with a heads up when the menu was presented 
R0061,Good meat  But thats basically it  
R0061,good Irish pub experience  �Lots of hustle and bustle  � Nice beer selection and the Banger and Mash was delicious    
R0061,Good was okay   Nothing new whatsoever  since I was last there 6 months ago  Menus tired and a bit grubby  Gin and tonics watery  ice logged  Its fine  Wouldnt be rushing back  I think its had its day and is flying on its reputation  but its a bit jaded now 
R0061,Gorgeous food and drinks  Looking forward to going back again 
R0061,Great attentive staff  top class setting and great food
R0061,Great evening at the counter  couple of tasty dishes
R0061,Great food and fun atmosphere   We were visiting Dublin from US and enjoyed our evening very much
R0061,Great food and service   
R0061,Great food  but avoid the upstairs tapas room  insist on sitting downstairs           the upstairs room is ajoined to the bar   the music is crazy loud  and the seats are really low  while the tables are regular height   really awkward seating position          didnt make for a great evening          
R0061,Great food  great layout  great ambience equals great night 
R0061,Great food  great service  and  great atmosphere  Will definitely be returning for more
R0061,Great food  Great service  Great buzz 
R0061,Great location  ambience and variety on the menu  My main issue was the speed with which the food came  We had a late booking  9:45  so there was surely no rush to get us out the restaurant for the next table cover  We ordered off the tapas menu and expected a slow stream of food  Instead we received everything we had ordered within 5 minutes of sitting down  The food ended up being cold because we couldnt eat it fast enough  Besides that each dish was disappointing  bland and the meat was undercooked  blue and bleeding   We asked for the food to be slowed down and were told it was too late it was already cooked except for one dish which eventually just never arrived 
R0061,"Our waitress clocked out before wed finished our meal so had to ask for the bill numerous times 

Disappointing meal overall "
R0061,Great meal here  perfect service  delicious cocktails 
R0061,Great place for a quick and tasty meal  Service is very fast and food is filling and at a resonable price The second dessert was great  Coconut rice balls with passion fruit sauce  Over all not a bad meal
R0061,Great place to chill and have nice drinks and food
R0061,Great pub  Ive been coming here for years  Always a fun crowd and the food is good quality pub grub and it has a reasonable price tag too 
R0061,Great service  cocktails  and food  We were greeted immediately and had prefect seats  this place is quiet with soft music and nice to have a conversation  Highly recommended
R0061,Great time 
R0061,Had a fabulous evening in here  Will definitely be back 
R0061,Had a really bad experience here on Saturday night   very slow service from start to finish  waited 5 minutes to be seated despite it not being busy  staff were all talking amongst themselves  our food came out at all different times meaning the sides were cold by the time our steak came out  waiter took our desert order twice and despite this he forgot to bring one of the two drinks ordered and the actual desert itself   We were then left waiting to pay the bill for 20 minutes despite the fact it was not busy   Shocking experience start to end  especially for the prices youre paying   you expect better   we wont be back

R0061,Had booked regular seating via the app  Was sat at the counter when I was seated and wasnt offered regular seating at a low table despite a table for 2 being clear at the regular seating the entire meal 
R0061,Had lunch  Great location  great interior  great menu   absolutely terrible stench of frying oil  The place needs to sort out a extractor solution  Had to go home and change before the next meeting which makes it a bit of a show stopper for business people with an afternoon schedule 
R0061,Had never visited here before and it was definitely the best tapas Ive had in a long time   Service was brilliant too  would highly recommend to try out
R0061,Had the cod filet with lentils for dinner  It was absolutely delightful  Their beers are pretty good too  Affordable and tasty  and really lovely servers  what more can you ask for 
R0061,Had the Taste Voucher  I was excited after reading the menu online but the set menu we were given was very limited and we ended up doubling and even tripling up on some of the options as some options were not to our tastes  raw fish etc   There was none of the grilled charred or braised options that they state on the voucher  Everything we ordered was lovely and tasty  would just have liked a larger selection  Would highly recommend the cocktail bar first  It was great atmostphere  great staff and really delicious   I would go back as what we ordered was very tasty  but wouldnt go using the Taste voucher again 
R0061,Had two servers  One was very good  the other very poor  Quite high  and  mighty attitude but was very poor at his job
R0061,Have been for dinner and really enjoyed it but brunch was disappointing overall 
R0061,"Hi
I would never make a comment on service in a restaurant as I think if the staff are busy then i would happily just wait  however  I found this service poor and we mentioned this to the staff  it was met with a slight shrug of the shoulders  The food was really great when we got it though  Have eaten here before and loved it so maybe just an off night for the team "
R0061,"Hi  we are regular visitors

We were really disappointed for the first time last Saturday   between us  we had 7 Tapas  and we ordered 2 at a time  which is what we always do  so the first two  same Steak one  came out together  but they forgot our fries and from then on  they were every 15 minutes BUT APART  So he got the lobster roll  I ordered the soft shell crab  got it 15 minutes later  They apologised but said it was always that way  never happened before   Then we ordered the crab toasties  his came 15 minutes before mine again  

At that point  we had drank our bottle of wine  and it was just really disappointing  as we were not offered anything   a glass of wine  an apology  nothing   We only tipped  Euro 5 as a result   but it our waitress was terrible  sorry 

I have attended Dylans restaurants around 15 times in the last 12 months  and this was the first time   so it wont stop me   plus i work for PayPal and we use them for work outings also   it wont stop me attending  but we were really disappointed  a goodwill gesture would be nice to encourage me back "
R0061,Host was unwelcoming  which is weird for Dublin  We were really looking forward to the meal and felt like seating us for our reservation was a hassle 
R0061,I expected more for the money 
R0061,I felt the food in wasnt so spectacular  but it was mediocre  Also the prices are pretty high for the tapas choices  and we felt like they werent so special  The tuna dish that we ordered to share was cooked too much even though we asked for medium rare  The ambiance wasnt so great either  as the tables are cramped up  and we were really close to our neighbours  Overall  I wouldnt recommend this place 
R0061,The meat was the toughest and chewiest of meats    like Im sure rubber would be easier to chew    it was so dry as well    
R0061,"I had eaten in other restaurant and loved the flavours of the food and had heard great things about this place  We had to be asked to be moved off the high ""school horse"" seats as we were made sit beside another couple on a 4 top  Food came very fast  but some was not a hot as youd expect  was expecting a lot more flavour and felt that I was basically being served slices of meat  "
R0061,I had French toast with bacon  The toast was soggy bread and the bacon tasted so aweful  It was not fresh at all  Looked like it had been lying around all day  This was 2 30 pm so it obviously had been  
R0061,I had made a reservation in advance  They seemed to not care and put us in an very awkward group seating area  They would not give us seating that was more private  I also was not a huge fan of the food 
R0061,I had visited here previously and found everything great  On this occasion though it wasnt quite right  Ordered first round of tapas and wine  We were almost finished the food before we had to ask for the wine  Ordered a second round out tapas and these took nearly 25 minutes before they arrived  Overall the food was just ok and the service just ok so wont be going back 
R0061,I have been to this restaurant many times and so was disappointed when the meal I had on Saturday night was a let down  Specifically  there were four of us and all four of us ordered several dishes  the dishes came out literally one by one with a serious time delay between each one  this resulted in us picking at the small portion of food politely waiting for the bulk of the order to arrive  This gave a disjointed feel to the meal and we were not left alone to share and enjoy our food  Some dishes were more successful than others  for example the burger and half chicken were far superior to the popcorn chicken dish 
R0061,"I have eaten here a couple of times and i was excited to dine again with my family for a Christmas get together 

We had two tables put together that wobbled throughout   i discretely highlighted this to the hostess who simply agreed the table was in fact wobbly and she had experienced problems with this before but wouldnt move us to another table despite there being tables available 

In general i rave about the food in here but as the dishes all came so slowly with huge gaps in between it was difficult to enjoy   Our largest share dishes  whole chicken  and  steak  were cold and when we were given orders from another table   we waited longer again to receive our actual orders 

I think there was a communication issue as we had to remind our server what we had ordered multiple times 

The popcorn chicken and tempura prawns however were delicious and i quite enjoyed the seasonal veg  and  hollandaise  

After waiting and waiting for our mains we were then told that we could look at the desert menu but we only have 15 minutes to order/eat our desserts and if we wanted tea or coffee we needed to include it in that 15 minutes   this was a mix up with another table when in fact we had 40 minutes  The desert was delicious but we were left with a bad taste in our mouth feeling like we were under time pressure to eat it  

I get it   Christmas is a great opportunity to flip as many tables as possible and get people in and out   I have to say i  did not enjoy the experience at all   I didnt have overly high expectations for a casual dining experience but even at that i was disappointed "
R0061,I lost count of the amount of times the wrong dishes were brought to our table  3 times a least  Which put us on edge as we wondered if we would ever get what we had ordered and also would our bill have the wrong items charged  The staff apart from these errors were friendly and knowledgeable when asked about food allergies and the wine list was brilliant as were our red and white choices  delicious  The food was a mixed bag  my three choices were all delicious  steak  iberico ham and cabbage  My friends dishes were fair to poor  the chicken had very little meat and the chickpea chips were almost inedible  I was really surprised with the service errors and mixed food quality as Im a huge Dylan Mc Grath fan  Ate here Tuesday 10/06/14
R0061,I often went to this place when I lived in US But unfortunately there is expensive more than US shop 
R0061,i took some french hotelier there seats very uncomfortable  over priced for small portions service bad food coming out in drips and drabs  every body finished and my food  came out 10 min later after asking waitress  wa it on the way  felt we were sitting  on top of the people at the other table
R0061,"The pad thai was just noodles and cooked oil/soysauce  There was nothing else in there   no lovely peanuts  no chicken  not even that nice pad thai color   it was just brown and noodles  I was so sad  Some of the noodles were even overcooked and tough to chew 

This place seems to be a popular takeout place for passerbys  but I dont really get it "
R0061,I was here a few times before but the food is definitely not up to the standard it was before      very dissapointing
R0061,The cost of the dishes and the wine list is really excessive and I still cant believe I paid  Euro 12 for a very ordinary Mojito  Really disappointing and wouldnt recommend 
R0061,I was in here on Friday night last  the place and staff are both very nice but the food was hugely disappointing  We ordered 6 different dishes and they all tasted the same  smothered in truffle oil and parmesan cheese  I like both but not on every dish 
R0061,I was looking forward to this and was bitterly disappointed  Compared to my last visit which i had enjoyed  the food was simply not good enough  I just cant  justify the bill
R0061,I was with a group of friends  We all ordered three dishes each  I thought the mushrooms with celeriac were very good  Next came tuna ravioli with tomato and it was rather disappointing  I love tuna but I couldnt really taste it as it was overpowered by onion  My third dish never arrived until everyone else at the table were actually done  We received goats cheese logs instead do lobster hotdog  Other diners assumed it was also ordered and helped themselves to it  When I mentioned it to the waiter he argued that Im wrong and that it was definitely ordered  He apologised later  My husband said steak was bland  Skinny chips were overdone  Duck was enjoyable  All in all not great    And a very loud place 
R0061,I would not recommend  Completely overpriced  Portions tiny  Dublin gone mad
R0061,Ive been here many times but I am disappointed in the new menu  The goats logs and replaced with goats cheese airbags which taste like nothing  The cured salmon was tasty but minuscule  Duck spring roles were ok   The waiters are always friendly and efficient  compared to other tapas style restaurants in the area the food and the value isnt great  Bring back the logs 
R0061,Incredibly good food   The soft shell crab in particular stood out 
R0061,"Initial server looking after us was a bit cold  and  looked bored  he was replaced by a lovely guy called rafael who was attentive  and  poilte while giving us our space  hard to do 
the food was a little overly pretentious ive been for tapas a few times  and  there are much more options for fussy eaters on the standard menu than the brunch menu  i enjoyed mine alot but my friends werent overly impressed"
R0061,it  is a fantastic food experience in a great atmosphere   not to be missed in Dublin
R0061,"It didnt wow me  but I did have one of the best burgers Ive ever tried  There were two patties  so it had plenty of tasty meat  The bun isnt the type I prefer  but it was good and had a very nice colour  The ingredients that complemented the burger were delicious and the hot sauce was actually spicy  The garlic butter fries were also a real treat 

The free refills are a nice touch and the place has a very cool mood  Good price for quality "
R0061,It was my third time had dinner there  food and service were great as always
R0061,it was really too much expensive for the quantity  we have wait to have few food
R0061,Its my third time and unfortunately I was disappointed with the the quality of the food this time  Ive been twice before and it was amazing  The standard just wasnt as high  Our waiter was great though  And so were the cocktails 
R0061,Its really expensive for extremely small portions  Food was nice though
R0061,just fabulous   great experience   the only negative was the toilets  they were not very clean 
R0061,Just ok food
R0061,Just loved it    We sat at the bar and watched the kitchen  It was fabulous 
R0061,Lacked creativity and presentation for main courses  When your paying for 2x30 euro for a steak you would expect it to be presented appealing not literally  steak on a plate with a bit of carmaleized onions  Waiters also working on top of one another which seemed like a free for all who could get the tip 
R0061,Limited menu but super delicious and such good service  Perfect little place and somewhere that Id recommend to everyone 
R0061,Limited Vegan Choice despite saying Vegan on website 
R0061,"Limited Vegan Choice despite saying Vegan on website   lovely server though 
Food not good "
R0061,Love the food and would recommend strongly for people go in regularly 
R0061,Loved my visit  place was buzzing  food was exciting and really tasty  Delighted
R0061,Menu is great but has gotten more expensive in recent years  Food tasty as always particularly the duck  Deserts were disappointing and over priced  Great buzz and atmosphere 
R0061,Most enjoyable evening
R0061,Music is too loud  its impossible to have a conversation
R0061,My boyfriend and I visited this restaurant for the first time on Wednesday  we were greeted at the reception by a lovely girl called ailish  we had the option to sit outside which was fantastic as weather was great  the place was very busy which is great to see midweek and a good sign of what was to come  our orders wer pork belly  crab toasties with duck egg sauce  chips sprinkled in parmesan and mini burger  not one crumb was left on our plates the food was out of this world  nicely filling and reasonable price  we both drank the 5 lamps red ale on draught  great food great drink n great atmosphere  highly recommend this place we will be back very soon 
R0061,My favourite restaurant  Wouldnt change a thing  The food is great and staff are friendly
R0061,My friends food came out 15 minutes before mine  My main came out without my side order and that did come out until my main was finished  Food was lovely but service was not good 
R0061,My husband and I went for Sunday lunch yesterday  I think the concept of the Bar is not explained correctly perhaps  You should order drinks and one or two dishes and keep ordering as you eat  We ordered 4 dishes and asked for 2 to be brought as starters and the other 2 after but it all arrived together  It was a bit messy and rushed  For  Euro 120 I dont think well be back   
R0061,My second time there and not the last  great tapas with great flavours  excellent service aswell  
R0061,"Nice buzzy athmosphere  
Food was disappointing  

Portions were small relative to cost even for tapas and food was cold several cases "
R0061,"Nice evening brought down by poor service 
1  We ordered a number of dishes and everything came out at different times  no problem as this is usual for tapas  But we had received all dishes except one  the bacon and cabbage burger  Still hungry  we ordered another 5 tapas  These all came out but still no burger  It took 45 minutes from ordering before we received the burger  when everything else had been eaten and we had no interest in it anymore 
2  We paid the bill and were waiting for change before giving the tip  We waited  and waited but still no change  When questioned  the waitress had assumed that all of the change was her tip  I would have thought it us up to the customer to decide on the tip       How rude We were not impressed"
R0061,not good for vegetarians  slow service  and  overpriced
R0061,Not memorable
R0061,On top of the amazing cappucino art the full irish breakfast was really good and the amount of food was surely enough to keep you full for long 
R0061,"Ordered a pizza  What I got was cheese and a bit of ""pizza""  I know how the real Italian pizza taste like  The one I had here was far from it   unfortunately   "
R0061,Outstand service and tasty food  Very trendy food and presentations  Great drink list too
R0061,Outstanding as always  Never disappoints  I wish I could get here more often 
R0061,"Over priced and under fed 
Tapas in Spain much more reasonably priced and better quality"
R0061,"Read good reviews and was exciting to eat here  Food was average and fairly bland considering the price I thought  
We got our food long before we got our drinks 
Service was poor and inattentive 
Sitting with on stools for the whole meal was uncomfortable 
 Fairly disappointing to be honest"
R0061,Really average food  way too brightly lit  and massively overpriced    came away hungry   
R0061,Really enjoyed the tapas  great combos   Well plated and served 
R0061,Really really great food and a great night  Would recommend 
R0061,Return visit  and highly enjoyable  as usual  Staff are so attentive and friendly  Tapas great 
R0061,Risotto dish looked  smelled  and tasted horrendous  The rest of the food my group got looked stale/cold and was mediocre at best  Would not recommend stopping by here during your trip to Dublin
R0061,Sat down to eat  at6 15 finished 2 courses by 6 40 food was very rushed and the table we were put at was in a drafty position beside the doors to the kitchen  Not impressed at all especially with the goats cheese rolls  Very poor quality for the price charged
R0061,"Service

The service was bad but to be fair I think that was just the girl who was serving us she was very inattentive  She forgot some of our order but we were still charged for it  we had to get our bill changed "
R0061,Service very slow no atmosphere not a very pleasant experience 
R0061,"Very disappointed with our visit having previously visited the experience 

Felt the whole experience was similar to fast food restaurant  get them in get their money and get them out "
R0061,Service was dreadful  Food was average maybe slightly overpriced 
R0061,When it opened first this was a great place with super food and a lovely atmosphere  But it seems like they are trading on their name  I dont recommend this restaurant  there are too many actually good places nearby 
R0061,Service was really poor  Food rushed out  difficult to get drinks to the table 
R0061,"Small place  but great taste in a good location  The pie I ordered was like eating comfort food and there was a sweet lady helping us as well 
Highly highly recommend  Dont think twice and go "
R0061,"So disappointed   We visited here a couple of years ago and boy has it got down hill   First the hostess on the door   rude and very poor customer service  I showed her my booking on online app confirming my name and full details and she claimed it was under someone else s name and that I had to change it online   when I for the fourth time said that I could not change it on my booking as the name was correct she became surly and just pointed to our table and said thats yours   It was a table right by the door with a curtain separating the door and we were cold and drafty  We would not have minded if the restaurant had been full but for the whole time we were there the place was more than half empty   When we did eventually sit down they did not have any of the items on the menu we had wanted to order   it is a limited tapas menu anyway so to be told there was no crab   no duck   no duck spring rolls and no chicken   did not leave much left   Food was very average when it arrived  
Bill came and they had over charged us for Prosecco which we did not have  
Then had to deal with the hostess for our coats who remained as poor on the customer service front than she had been when we arrived "
R0061,So disappointed  Wont be returning
R0061,We decided to give it one more last shot  having not been back since the menu changed and we were still sorely disappointed  We thought for sure they might have listened to their clients feedback and reverted to the old menu   but no such luck  Many people weve spoken to and even the staff have acknowledged that the new menu is unpopular with longtime diners  We wont be coming back unfortunately 
R0061,So disappointed  We have been regular clients for many years  dining at least every six weeks or so  Since they changed the menu we have not been back  All the old favourites are now gone  truffle popcorn chicken  crab hens egg  etc  and they have altered the recipes of others  airbags   All the dishes we used to love are now gone 
R0061,Sorry to say but it was all a very rushed experience  We were early and ordered a cocktail but couldnt sit anywhere as we hadnt booked a seat  Our table was ready so we sat there ordered our food our cocktails came and we had to drink them with food as it arrived immediately no relaxation at all  Staff were lovely but Akron did a very rushed experience and I was sitting by the window and I was frozen   
R0061,Staff were lovely  and  really knowledgeable  Atmosphere  and  decor were gorgeous too 
R0061,"Starving after a day spent out in the cold and wind yesterday  we ordered from here and were thrilled to bits when the doorbell rang just 20 minutes later  Getting a takeaway delivered this fast  especially on a Friday evening  is something short of a miracle  

But sadly  our glee ended there  The rice was first to be opened  A solid block of white mush it was  the grains indistinguishable from one another  Next were the two curries  one lamb massaman and one duck red curry  Both had an inch of oil floating on the top  which we had to pour off  We were off to a very bad start 

The duck was nice  not too fatty  and the red curry sauce was pleasant enough  though lacking the punch that I crave from thai food  The vegetables that were supposed to be in it consisted of one green bean  a few bamboo shoots and one single slice of red chilli  Disappointing 
The portions are half the size  and if you ask me  half the quality  of other restaurants  but we couldnt even finish them  It was one of the worst take aways Ive had in a long time  and a complete waste of  Euro 25 "
R0061,Superb food  great atmosphere and can only recommend it 
R0061,Tapas in there with a group of friends and had a super night
R0061,Tasty  but very small portions and very high prices is not a great combination
R0061,Terrible  Taco shells are stale  gross  and brittle  Sad people think these are good tacos  Cant wait to get real tacos back in the US 
R0061,The 100 decibel noise level made this a poor dining experience
R0061,The food here was great  but unfortunately  even with advance notice  I had an allergic reaction  The waitstaff told me which foods to order  but clearly did not check or communicate well with the kitchen 
R0061,The food is nice but grossly over priced and the place is extremely noisy  Such that you have to shout at your dinner companion across a small table 
R0061,"The food was OK but overpriced for the quality/quantity  Service was OK however we had to wait for the wine list as ""they were out at the printers getting printed""  We booked a table in the bar however we ended up at a table upstairs in this place  Although it was a nice room it lacked atmosphere  It felt like an ""overflow"" room "
R0061,The food was superb  We really enjoyed it  especially the pork belly and padron peppers  On the night they had a promotion   2 4 1 tapas so the value was incredible
R0061,The meat portions in this place are overpriced given how small they are  Wouldnt be rushing back 
R0061,The menu is interesting more than the food is good  although the good is okay  However my main complaint was that the service was terrible  The waiter was rude and uninterested  One dish didnt come  after 10 mins of the last of the other tapas  We asked about it and he said � oh ok  Ill check  15 mins later is still hadnt arrived  We asked again and he didnt apologise  just said something like �maybe its in the kitchen  like it was no big deal  I would not return or recommend to friends 
R0061,I found the portions small even by tapas standards  the meats incredibly fatty to the point where we had to cut huge chunks off  we had the sirloin and the pork belly   and on a Saturday  when they should have planned for a lot of business  two of the dishes of an already small menu were unavailable  We tried the crispy airbags  among other items  and they were cold  I dont think it was by design  Then  their credit card machine was low on battery  so we had to drag ourselves downstairs  rather than the waiter locate another one to bring upstairs   The whole experience left a lot to be desired 
R0061,The part of the restaurant where we were seated was far from the fun ambiance of the other rooms and close to two doors that led outside  making the room freezing 
R0061,The place itself is really cosy and has a chilled vibe which I love and theres loads of different places you can sit which is quite nice as even if it got busy it wouldnt feel overcrowded  And the staff were extremely friendly and helpful also  
R0061,The restaurant was amazing  The initial welcome could be a lot better 
R0061,The service was good attentive and friendly servers  One dish of the many we ordered stood out  this was the parmesan truffle pasta   very tasty  but literally 3 strands of pasta in it  We ordered another to fully appreciate the dish  We actually asked if this came in a larger portion  we were told it did not  No exceptions made on our request  Other dishes we ordered ranged from prawn skewers  cod cheeks etc   presentation very nice  taste very bland  The cocktails were delicious however  The seats were uncomfortable  The server never brought us back our change assumed it was a tip  Overall rating 2 stars   a restaurant can have the best service  and  coolest premises in the world  but if the food is not up to the same standard I wont return 
R0061,The tapas and cocktails were delicious and the staff couldnt have been nicer 
R0061,The worst dining experience I have had in the last 24 months  Service was not great  but what was exceptionally bad was the food  I ordered the fish pie which was the worst I have ever tasted and chucked out from been reheated 
R0061,"Third time dining here  Food indifferent  sevice so so  Icing on the cake was they charged us  Euro 180+ for lunch for four people  Turns out they gave us the wrong bill and because our group of four didnt know each other   we paid it  Bill was actually 82 00  
Overally  for sitting on benches  and a menu that smacks of the Kings new clothes  I wouldnt go back for a fourth time "
R0061,Third time I went reluctantly for a meal with friends where we had to leave and go to other place for pizza after because the food was so bad 
R0061,This is a favourite place of mine have always Sat downstairs but this time we were upstairs and the music was so loud we couldnt hear one another across the table  We asked for music to be lowered but still way to loud  Drinks were very slow to arrive so dissapointed this visit  But I will return and recommend 
R0061,This is my second visit here and although food was tasty I dont think I would be going back 
R0061,This is now my favourite restaurant in Dublin  the food and service is outsanding  I highly recommend the truffle pasta  divine 
R0061,This was by far the best Fish and Chips in Ireland   The waiter was fantastic   They had live music and a great atmosphere   We had so much fun there 
R0061,My husband got the burrito and I didnt like it  Im not sure about the flavor  It interesting  It definitely doesnt taste like Mexican food in California or Mexico or Kansas  Its wasnt awful  but I bet there is a different Mexican/ burrito place in Dublin that is better  Thats just my opinion  oh and  there super hot sauce isnt hot  so dont be fooled  If you like spicy youll be disappointed 
R0061,"This was my 2nd visit  �I came because I had a good meal the 1st time around  although its been almost 2 yrs  � I tired to book a table for 3  over 2 weeks earlier and to their credit  they followed up and called me in the US to get me a table for 3  � We had 
As for the meal it was good  not as I remember  which brought me back  �I had started with the duck liver creme  served in a jar with pistachios  � I was looking for something approaching a pate  this was too creamy  too many pistachios and wasnt too appealing  bland  and  lacking taste  �I next I had a risotto with chorizo  �It was good  a little spicy  �a good amount of chorizo  different  and  not bad  � For my main I had the lamb shank  �it was good  and  I enjoyed it  tender  and  as advertised  � 

As for the service  very friendly  attentive  though with a tiny table  we had to summon the waiter to remove dishes that were finished simply to have a bare minimum amount of room on the table  �

Overall with a larger table I would rate 3 4 stars  �The table was so bad it made for a REALLY BAD dinning experience  for my 2 mates  and  myself  �I might add though this is only my 2nd rating on Yelp  I have many reviews on the other site  �As a 32 yr airline pilot and living 1/2 my life on the road  living in hotels and restaurants  domestically and internationally I believe I have objectivity  and  experience to write an honest review of the type 

My suggestion to the owners  is find a bigger space with larger tables or just get larger tables   and  �never ever put 3 people alone 3 �men on those tiny tables  �This is like a kid who has all the potential  and  doesnt live up to it  �It detracts from a very nice product you deliver "
R0061,This was one of my favourite restaurants but the menu has changed and much less choice of food available  Far too expensive for tapas choice  Disappointing  Wont be back again 
R0061,This was recommended to us but food and service was very average  The octopus was burnt and had to leave most of it 
R0061,"This was the third time and it was the worst of them all:
 Clumsy explanation of the dishes
 bad humour by the employee
 way too much waiting time between dishes 
The food itself was 4 stars   which is good   but everything else on this day didnt really work  Maybe a bad day in the Office  I assume "
R0061,"this was the worst Nasi Goreng  fried rice  I ever tasted   

NOT RECOMMENDED and best to AVOID"
R0061,Thoroughly enjoyed our day  staff extremely helpful and delicious food 
R0061,"Thought the food was overpriced for lunch  
Thought the food was quite formal for the surroundings and ambience  
Portions were small so worked out expensive as had to get two or three plates 
Also decor quite shabby in places  
Disappointed "
R0061,Tiny portions  big prices  No atmosphere  big rip off 
R0061,"To be honest i almost gave this restaurant only two stars  

Anyway the negative: Slow and unengaged service   they didnt really seem to care  
there was a long list of nice sounding burgers and sides   I had the Swiss burger  which was a ok  "
R0061,Too noisy  food really over priced  portion size too small
R0061,"The most upsetting in a restaurant the chefs were eating al the time and therefore touching and eating food whilst also preparing and serving it 
They probably dont think that customers nice this sort of thing or that it doesnt matter but it does "
R0061,"had been here before and thought it was ok and wished to try it again and wished I hadnt bothered 
from trying to get served drink upstairs to being given the cloakroom table downstairs to the disappointing food and the disappointing service 
sorry to complain but disappointing doesnt cover it"
R0061,"totally disappointed  staff and food 
everything was underwhelming "
R0061,Two plates of food out before drinks  15 minutes later two more plates  Another full 25 minutes before the fifth plate came out  I know tapas are �as theyre ready  but this was comical�  Service poor
R0061,Unimpressed unfortunately  Could be me as I am used to ramen  in California  The broth was just lacking  Bland  no salt or depth  Added a lot of soy sauce and still just meh  Shrimp were extremely overcooked  The restaurant is very nice though and the servers are very attentive and nice  I might give it another try 
R0061,The onion rings  little tip to the owners try do real onion rings instead of 70 cent ones from store
R0061,Used a voucher from the internet   excellent value  Food was fun and delicious 
R0061,Very disappointed with the menu  yes we had a dining room voucher but the food was not up to standard at all  Popcorn truffle was the worst very very poor 
R0061,Very disappointed with the whole experience   You are sitting on top of the people beside you   Food was ok  but over priced for what it is   Wont be returning
R0061,Very expensive with very little choice of dishes  Service was very good though 
R0061,"very good evening and food 
great if you like sharing
excellent service"
R0061,Very small portions for value  Unfortunately we left feeling very hungry after buying the recommended 3 tapas each
R0061,Very welcoming staff and good place to spend time with friends  The prices are reasonable  Food and drinks were excellent
R0061,Waitress was rude and disagreeable   She got my wifes drink order wrong and had to be pushed to correct it and after that ignored us   Ugh  She has glasses and hair pulled back in bun   Wish I had her name so that this feedback could be provided to her 
R0061,"Warning    Im about to do a lot of complaining   
I do not understand the hype about this place  People may disagree with me but I really dont like it here  I will never be returning  The place is so dirty and grim  The layout of everything doesnt make sense and they dont use up all of their available space  with only 8 tables available  I was so uncomfortable at our table between the seats and the height of the table  
There is no point in coming here to wait for a table just for a mediocre burger when there are much nicer  cleaner and better places for burgers in Dublin  Okay  if you are around this area  I dont understand why anyone would choose to come here  The prices are the same  The food wasnt good  Of course it looks decent  but there are better options  The chips were covered in so much salt I felt like I was eating pure salt  The meat in the burger was bad quality  
I honestly think people just come in here and automatically dont expect much and that is why they think the food is so good  I just dont know  It is a place for a group of lads to get their food in before a big night out "
R0061,Was my first time here and it was amazing  Me and my wife had a fantastic experience
R0061,Wasnt happy with the service  wrong order brought to table  Pretty bad table service by one particular waiter  Pushed against my wife without an apology 
R0061,We ate at the bar  it was really delicious  Staff were very nice and attentive 
R0061,"We booked herel for a long overdue catch up with a friend visiting from New York  I wanted somewhere I knew there would be good food and a glass of wine   and somewhere we could sit outside on a Friday was a real plus  But the service was terrible  I explained that I was gluten intolerant and ordered 3 tapas that I was told were gluten free or could be made gluten free  My friend got two more   we were delighted   until the food came out and wasnt a bit gluten free    I was hungry post work  The waitress suggested I eat the piece of salmon off the top of the bread    My friends food arrived and I had to wait 30mins for a steak to appear   after I was finished my fries  
Disappointing as Gluten Free and Gluten Adaptable are offered  A bit of a mess  
No apologies but they did take the items I couldnt eat off the bill    but no apologies which was disappointing  Dont think Ill be back"
R0061,We booked lunch here on New Years Day to celebrate a birthday but were disappointed with our decision  A lot of the menu choices were not available and no alternatives were offered  We had eaten here in the past but this occasion was disappointing 
R0061,"We came here after a tiring day hoping to get some good food  we were disappointed  The place enforces every person to order a main course which imo is promoting food wastage  This is the first time I have seeing something like this  We were not super hungry but still had to order four main course  
The food was also not super great  it was too oily and devoid of any flavour  The two vegetarian dishes we ordered had the same curry base  just the vegetables changed  The chicken was also dry and not cooked well 
We were visiting Dublin but if we had been living here  I would avoid this place for any future visits "
R0061,"We did not know the place but went on adverts  First impressions were �lets get out of here 
Packed  Too noisy  Impossible to hold a conversation 
Good food but portions exceptionally small and expensive  A big mistake  Would not return "
R0061,We enjoyed every moment of this experience  Definitely a great deal to go on Sunday for 2 for 1 Tapas 
R0061,We were disappointed with the service which seemed overwhelmed and a bit addled  The food was great and a good buzz about the place
R0061,We were told we had the table for 2 hours  but got rushed off it after 1 5 hours as they had to set it for the next setting  This ruined what had been a good experience up to that point 
R0061,"We were very much looking forward to our visit but from our arrival things didnt look promising   We were shown to our table then our waitress seemed determined to ""ignore"" us for as long as possible   We waited patiently for our drinks order to be taken but she seemed terribly busy and not interested in our table and my husband asked one of the managers for someone to take our order   Finally  when she decided to serve us   we asked her advice on the menu and she was unenthusiastic and all with NO SMILE   The food itself was perfectly nice  albeit overpriced  and some dishes were outstanding but the general atmosphere was disappointing and our waitress really made the evening a ""big let down""  Was this simply a sole individual having a bad night or do need to look at their ""staff training""  I really dont like leaving negative reviews  but our experience was such a disappointment "
R0061,Went here looking for some quick food before a night out and I am sorry to say we were very disappointed  Pad Thai was overly sweet and I noticed they used the microwave to heat up something in the kitchen  Hygiene seemed to be lacking also  Avoid
R0061,"Went with a friend for tapas on Friday evening 

Venue is very loud  which makes a normal  relaxed conversation nearly impossible   my throat was sore after we left  as I had to scream over the background music 

We were at the Bar  on the benches next to the bar  which meant that every time a waiter or waitress passed by between people sitting at the bar part and me  sitting on the bench  I kept getting accidentally pushed  This was really annoying 

Bland chickpea chips  ok soft shell crab and nice wild mushrooms  Mini doughnuts were the highlight of our dinner 

Service was good   very attentive 

Overall  there are many more far nicer places  so no point of recommending this to anyone "
R0061,Wonderful atmosphere and amazing food  Highly recommend 
R0061,Wonderful food  Friendly  fast service and great atmosphere  Will definitely be back  Highly recommended 
R0061,Wonderful service and great food 
R0061,Worst delivery I ever had  Thai red curry was pure water running over plate with soggy carrots  Horrible chop suey sauce  Chicken was slimy and prawns rubbery  So disgusting  Never again  Not fresh one bit and obviously dont care or notice how bad the quality is  Feel sick  It went straight to the bin  Coke was nicest bit of meal 
R0061,would not pay full price for this food     the service was extremely rushed and the food also lacked in presentation      will not be going back
R0061,Wow   Every tapas is a piece of food art  and the service was exceptional 
R0061,Yes for a nice atmosphere and drinks but not really for food or tapas
R0061,Great location let down by mediocre food and service  
R0062,Excellent food and service  Thumbs up
R0062,Fantastic food and cocktails  great atmosphere and service
R0062,Fantastic  Great food and Atmosphere  Would definitely come back again 
R0062,Fantastic  Everything I tasted was delicious  Great service  Great ambiance 
R0062,good especially the pizza
R0062,Good food good service and interesting decor
R0062,Great food and lovely ambience and service
R0062,Great food and wonderful service    We had a pre theatre sitting
R0062,Laszlo the waiter was very good and kind 
R0062,Lovely wine  great food great service 
R0062,Start to finish this was our favorite place in town 
R0062,The best meal and atmosphere in Dublin a wonderful evening  Staff were fabulous
R0062,The best restaurant I have ever been  Food and service excellent 
R0062,"
Im a regular  I always book through the online app 
I booked a table for valentines eve having read that there would be 2 menus available in two different price ranges 
Last night I was offered just one menu 
I am disappointed that you did this and had I known in advance it would have affected my restaurant choice 
Could you please address this  It feels like false advertising 
"
R0062,10/10 for service  food and ambiance  A great night out 
R0062,A good evening  great for the style of food and value 
R0062,A great place to have food and drinks in a sightly open and wider space  Feels like an old factory workshop converted into a restaurant nu has a good vibe  Food was great  the prawns gamba and the garlic bread were particularly good  
R0062,A touch on the noisy side  but excellent food and wine  Interesting new menu  Cheerful good service
R0062,Absolutely brilliant meal here  Strong menu and top service meant we had a great night
R0062,All of the food was over cooked  The pork belly was one big piece of fat yet at the same time dried  out    Even the roll that came with the lamb stew was dry  To top it off their cooling system was apparently sucking in cigarette smoke from outside so my throat was raw by the end of the meal 
R0062,Beautiful place  Lovely service
R0062,Almost the worst Italian rest  Ive been to  I would think that Italy is not that far away  no excuse  The food was Italian in name only  Much more promising Italian down the street 
R0062,"Amazing and tasty food unlike any other restaurants in Dublin city centre 
A great place for friends to enjoy dinner "
R0062,Amazing food and service  Cant wait to back  We were super impressed  Thank you 
R0062,Amazing food and service  Highly recommended  You should try lamb shank and Croatian wine  Very nice and friendly atmosphere 
R0062,Amazing food  service  location  Highly recommended
R0062,Amazing friendly service  great food  Love the whole package 
R0062,Amazing organic food 
R0062,Amazing people were super nice they even gave us some complementary sides 
R0062,Amazing would love to come back 
R0062,Amazing  The place is very nice and the service is excellent  We ordered a la carte and all the options were very good  Good wine list  Great place 
R0062,Ambience food and service were all top notch   from greeting to leaving we couldnt find fault with anything  Highly recommend
R0062,Appalling service  felt very uncomfortable  will not go back
R0062,As a coeliac i was not pleased to find that this place does not adapt its menu to cater for coeliac dietary restrictions  which in this day and sge is expected  certainly in restaurants with this pedigree  Very disappointing choice as a result 
R0062,As always food and service was 100 percent no matter how busy it is its always top quality  Looking forward to my next visited
R0062,"As weve been here a few times  we got used to really great food  but this time  unfortunately  it was mediocre at best  Menus remain more or less the same although the prices went up by 20 percent   30 percent 

On the other hand  the reason we kept coming back was the fact that service was one of the best weve ever received  and paying extra for that was something we were more than happy to do  This time  it was a service that youd get in some local pub  It was alright but serving food over your head  taking my plate although I wasnt done and general clumsiness is not something youd expect from a place like this one 

In the end  when offered to tip  our waiter rejected with the explanation that the restaurant makes enough and doesnt need a tip 

Overall  it became a mediocre place  not really worth their salt  and I dont think Ill be back here again "
R0062,"Ate there on Friday night   We were squeezed into a table beside a group of people   We could hardly hear ourselves speak they were so loud and so close to us   
We ordered our food and requested a Dexter Steak to be cooked medium to well done   The steak alone cost 82 euro which was a steak to share   
The starter arrived and it was lovely   Then the main course arrived with the veg side order but the steak was no where near cooked enough and we had to send it back  neither of us could have eaten it it was so undercooked  They left the veg to get cold and then when the steak eventually arrived back they had forgotten the chips  In fact we had practically finished the meat by the time they arrived  Very poor service   They did give us the potato sides and one round of drinks free but it was ridiculously expensive for what we got and the service was so poor  Overall a very average to poor experience   We had reserved a table at the bar but cancelled it on our way out and no one even asked us why  Disappointed  My friend had travelled from the uk to see me for the weekend and I had hoped the meal would have lived up to alot more  Wont be going back "
R0062,Attended here with my boyfriend for my birthday last Saturday night  Food was amazing  service was fantastic   Highly recommend
R0062,"Avoid this place  Without doubt the worst buffet I have ever been to Terrible selection of Food  Quite a few selections were Cold  Curry Sauce was stone cold 

As I had my baby daughter with me  I put her into baby chair which turned out to broke and she could have had a serious accident  Staff very unhelpful and rude once I mentioned this to them "
R0062,Awesome food and friendly staffs
R0062,Bad experoence 
R0062,Below average food with poor service
R0062,Best food in town  Amazing service   just over all best restaurants with simple quality products 
R0062,Best Lamb Stew ever   Stylish restaurant with a fresh take on old classics   Truly memorable 
R0062,Best steak and great service
R0062,Bit of harassment to get the food ordered  Didnt appreciate the waitress being so overly attentive and constantly topping the wine up any time we took a sip from the glass  Asked to leaved when we were 5 mins over our allocated time slot and still eating dessert  However the food was lovely and staff our always at hand 
R0062,We had no time as rushed out so quickly  a lot of money for poor service and average food  disappointed doesnt come close
R0062,Booked the restaurnat for 6p m  on a friday  the staff contacted us in advance to confirm the booking  When we arrived we were promptly seated  there is a great energetic atmosphere  Service was friendly and fast  we both ordered from the woodfire and were both extremely happy with what we got  a great alternative base for a pizza   we both had desserts and again very satisifed  mine was the ginger and rubharb  in all the dishes   the flabours were well fused and everything was so tasty  I would highly recommend this restaurant 
R0062,Booked this for a birthday and business meal  we were advised after sitting down that we had to be out by 20 30pm  not the best food  rushed so much that no time for desert  told it was in the ts  and  Cs on website  lol  read the small print  I have just opened a large office in grand canal square for a company called Citadel Investment s  certainly wont be revisiting this restraint  complained about the meal and was told we should have complained earlier   We had no time as rushed out so quickly  a lot of money for poor service and average food  disappointed doesnt come close
R0062,Busy and buzzy  with delicious food and great service
R0062,complicated menu  big but very little choice for non meat eaters  Overpriced for what it is
R0062,Could not fault it  Great night out  Service  Food  Atmosphere all brilliant 
R0062,Delicious food and excellent staff
R0062,Delicious food and very good service  I will recomend it for any ocasiones 
R0062,Delicious lamb  chicken or legumes can be wrapped in flatbread or made as a salad   delicious flavors   Very friendly staff 
R0062,Despite the restaurant not being full  we were placed adjacent to the waiting staff area which was very disruptive for us and extremely noisey   The waitress was very abrupt and almost rude   Food was good 
R0062,Did not appreciate being told the table was needed right at the 2 hour mark even with online apps around us  Good food and service up until that point 
R0062,Didnt live up to expectations   Food very average and service  very  slow given the restaurant was only half full 
R0062,"Dined there with my other half  We were placed in a very tight corner in front of the drinks area  We were practically sitting on the table beside us  The entire time we were there there was a table of 4 empty  Every time the waiting staff were attending the table beside us we had to move stuff on out table  I felt sorry for the staff working in such a tight confined area and they were over apologetic to us regarding our dinner being constantly interrupted 
I dont think this is acceptable as we were well paying guests to be placed in such a bad area "
R0062,Disaapointed with experience in general and shocked at some of the specials board prices      Euro 74 for 500g of Dexter steak    someones having a laugh   Soup was nice but was cold  mushroom ravioli was sparse on the plate  rhubarb dessert not full of flavor   Cocktails nothing special   Wouldnt go back 
R0062,"Disappointed on the night  Quite a lot of items off the menu  Service slow
Overall  felt it was not good value"
R0062,"Disorganized  tills not working and not a clear picture of where to order what  And this is when the queues were pretty short 

To add to the offense cashier gives you your change in a big wad  drops some coins in the process and then when it doesnt match the change youre owed its your fault  of course 

Good thing that there are a lot of better options around "
R0062,Dont order the Irish stew  The 3 finger size pieces of steak may have been braised but not in my lifetime and then covered in a milk sauce to disguise the dried up offering  
R0062,"Dont order the Irish stew  The 3 finger size pieces of steak may have been braised but not in my lifetime and then covered in a milk sauce to disguise the dried up offering  We were compensated but the moment had passed for another main meal replacement  
On the upside the ravioli was good "
R0062,Drinks are amazing  Food is easy to share  Great atmosphere 
R0062,"Ate here before and the food was great  Was a little disappointed this time round  The main issue was that it was freezing  When mentioned to the waitress she said   ""I know its terrible isnt it  it is always like this""  A few heaters and some closed doors would help "
R0062,Everything absolutely delicious  Wonderful service      Can you open one in Los Angeles please 
R0062,"Everything was fine except the toilets  
Having no running water in your toilets is unacceptable "
R0062,Excellent all round  very nice experience from start to finish
R0062,Excellent food  atmosphere  service  Overall  a must when in Dublin  Highly recommended 
R0062,Excellent food  brilliant service  Thanks for a perfect evening out 
R0062,Excellent meal and superb service as always  A true Dublin gem 
R0062,Excellent meal  fabulous service  A truly memorable experience 
R0062,Excellent night  great food and amazing staff my customers loved it 
R0062,Excellent service and atmosphere  Would definitely visit again on our next trip to Dublin 
R0062,Excellent welcome from the front door   love this place for whatever the occasion  
R0062,Excellente experience  Food was incredible  the attention was  great
R0062,Exceptional  have been before and it did not disappoint this time either
R0062,Extremely slow service  Waited 2+ hrs for food  Food good but not amazing   cool decor 
R0062,Fabulous Fofod  and  wine  and  a great atmosphere with super friendly staff  we cant wait to go back 
R0062,Family meal before Christmas  5 adults and one child  Starters were all good  3 ordered fillet steak and all were not served as ordered  One was sent back and returned cooked perfectly  other 2 werent happy but didnt send back  Other 2 meals were fine  Chips with steak were  Euro 5 extra which was steep on top of  Euro 34 for steak  Werent asked about rest of food when one being sent back and  no apology or regret expressed  Wont be back 
R0062,Fantastic food at a very reasonable price  Winning combination
R0062,Fantastic menu  great food 
R0062,Fantastic once again a joy to eat at a very special place
R0062,fantastic service from a really friendly staff   excellent value Early Bird
R0062,Fantastic spot  go visit  Food and service were amazing 
R0062,Fantastic wines at reasonable prices and delicious food  highly recommend the rabbit and smoked trout  Yummi   
R0062,Far too noicy and the filet I had did not meet the standard you should have  I had a better piece of meat in Galway for half the price 
R0062,Felt so rushed  Went with my boyfriend for our anniversary  food came within 10 mins of ordering and was cold and not as we had heard  waiters rushing us  constantly asking if we were finished  bill was brought within minutes of plates being cleared  By the time we ordered  ate and paid the bill we were there 40 minutes  I hadnt even finished the one drink I ordered 
R0062,First class food  great location and excellent service  Highly recommended 
R0062,Food is amazing  Cocktails are the best  Staff are all lovely  Especially Chris in the bar 
R0062,"Food spectacular  sadly  service sporadic with an all or nothing  erring on the side of ""nothing"" too often  We were a party of 2 celebrating a birthday and while the food was divine  the service ruined the overall experience  Firstly  felt not interested in table for 2  We were seated for about 15 minutes when a party of 6 were seated beside us and given water and attention while we continued to wait for anyone to approach us  We would have forgiven this indiscretion only it set the tone for the remainder of the evening  Started to feel grateful when a waiter did approach us     we were given prosecco at the end of the meal as an apology  however  the damage was done  I would be reluctant to return  notwithstanding the food "
R0062,Food was delicious    wine was good as well  Good overall experience  
R0062,"This time a little underwhelming  
No usual specials"
R0062,"I found the value for money poor for the portion size  14 euro for 2 scallops on mash as a starter  
Restaurant was incredibly noisy and servers were over burdened  It was probably the tone of year "
R0062,Food was excellent  Dont skip dessert no matter how stuffed you are 
R0062,Food was good although the restaurant smelled quite greasy  The manager was fairly rude  and  wanted us gone an hour and 40 minutes into a 4 course meal  I wouldnt recommend on this basis  Price point seems high given the overall experience but may have felt better about it had the service been better 
R0062,Food was good but prob expected better for the price 
R0062,Food was good however  we were given a set menu with no option outside of that  I asked two different waiters if it was only the set menu  I was told it was because we were a group booking  this is not outlined during the booking procedure online or on the two follow up phone calls to confirm booking  We were never asked if we were ok for drinks  we ordered a second bottle of wine which never arrived  half an hour later we asked for it as it was ordered a long time ago  the wine was produced with no apology  Staff in General were abrupt/rude and seemed under resourced  As the member of our group who recommended your restaurant  based on previous experience with my husband  I was embarrassed by your lack of attentiveness to our table 
R0062,Food was good  Service was very bad  Think it was the partic waiter we had    As when we asked another waitress service was much quicker and better
R0062,Food was great as usual  Service fantastic 
R0062,Food was incredible  could not fault it  Staff and service fantastic  Totally recommend  
R0062,Food was lovely ridiculously expensive   Wasnt told that the table was only for two hours  For the prices you are charging this is unreasonable and very expensive for the portion size  I had lamb and got 6 small slices of lamb for  Euro 29  Lovely food but wouldnt recommend 
R0062,Food was terrible  Way over priced  
R0062,Food was terrible  Way over priced  Would not recommend at all  AVOID
R0062,Friendly and fun service   Great array of food including a few healthy options  Wonderful experience 
R0062,Friendly staff  good service but horribly let down by the food  The menu is over complicated  over priced and just didnt deliver 
R0062,Friendly  great food  good ambience  Seafood superb  Reasonably priced too  Rustic and out of the way  Cosy and chatty  Recommend the duo beef 
R0062,From the host at the door to the final good bye  the service at was excellent  The food was outstanding and I actually battled to choose from the menu because virtually everything appealed  It was not my first visit  but it was the first for the other 3 in the party who left suitably impressed  Highly recommended is the rabbit dish and Guinness stew  Save space for the sides: the colcannon and blackened cauliflower are to die for  I will be back 
R0062,Good atmosphere  very busy  Staff very friendly  However  flatbreads had to be sent back for reheating  disappointing  And reluctance from waiting staff to allow us order different veg options to suit our requirements  Had to stick to the menu  no altering  hmmm     Expensive but knew that before we went   wouldnt mind the expense if it was worth it  Unfortunately we dont think it was completely worth it 
R0062,"Good food  Very noisy 
The main downside was the brusqueness of enforcing their 2 hour table policy  Another 10 minutes and we were ready to leave  but even though there were empty tables  and others that were there longer than us  we were told it was �time to go�  Unlikely we will return "
R0062,Great atmosphere with amazing food served by the friendliest people
R0062,Great birthday for myself here
R0062,Great evening
R0062,"Great evening after a long journey 
Delicious food and very good service 
I recommend the venison  and the crab "
R0062,Great experience  Duck liver mousse was amazing  Service is extremely professional and easy approachable  Food is great and soooo tasty  I would highly recommend the restaurant to everyone  Next time Im going for tapas  
R0062,Great food and good service  A bit overpriced as in London prices in Dublin 
R0062,Great food but overpriced   Steaks are gorgeous but sauces  sides etc all cost extra 
R0062,Great food  great atmosphere  will look forward to going again 
R0062,Great food  great service   Will definitely be back thank you
R0062,Great food  Normal service  Way too noisy  you cant keep a normal conversation
R0062,Great fun place   superb service and really really good steaks
R0062,Great local Irish food 
R0062,Great location  atmosphere and food  Will definatey make a point of going again
R0062,Great meal  Lovely setting  Friendly and attentive service 
R0062,"Great rooms  decorations  ambience  atmosphere  �Food was pot tired for one stew and not heated through for the fish pie  �
�Frankly  I was disappointed  
"
R0062,Great nights entertainment   Fantastic singer  and  musicians   Friendly staff  and  good food  Would highly recommend
R0062,Great pizza  service  location and prices were fine  It was a nice change and the outside upper deck was lovely 
R0062,Great place for a leisurely lunch
R0062,Great place  Amazing food  great service  Defo worth a trip 
R0062,Great service and fantastic food  the set menu was brilliant
R0062,Great service and good quality food  A good buzzy spot 
R0062,Great service  Contemporary interpretation of classic cuisine  Delicious flavors 
R0062,Great service  Nice venue  Good food
R0062,great spot  great food and brill staff and great atmosphere   the place was really buzzing
R0062,Greeted by a friendly and welcoming lady who took our coats and promptly brought us to our table  As it was Valentines night the restaurant was busy but service was excellent  Our waitress was attentive without being intrusive  Food was amazing  well cooked and excellently presented  Excellent selection of wines and cocktails  After our meal we we moved to the bar upstairs to have some cocktails  This restaurant  bar and tapas bar really is a whole night experience  Couldnt fault it  Highly recommended 
R0062,Had a great meal here  the service was outstanding 
R0062,Had a lovely pre theatre meal here  Great  Euro 25 early menu  3 courses and plenty of options to choose from  Lovely stew and banoffe for dessert  Great value  would highly recommend
R0062,Had business dinner here  Flavour of food was great but all 5 steaks were cooked wrong  Came very rare not medium 
R0062,"Hi 

Im a regular here  I always book through the app 
I booked a table for valentines eve having read that there would be 2 menus available in two different price ranges 
Last night I was offered just one menu 
I am disappointed that you did this and had I known in advance it would have affected my restaurant choice 
Could you please address this  It feels like false advertising "
R0062,"Hi 
 My first visit  I would highly recommend it Food was excellent and our waiter was outstandingly explained the menu very well and was very attentive  

Happy to recommend will definitely be back  

Regards 
Niamh Murray"
R0062,"Hi   ive heard a lot of good things about the place in the past so i said ill call in   very nice looking place etc   but the fillet was over done and slightly tough after i had asked for it to be medium  there was no blood visible whatsoever    i told my friends about this the next day and that the foid in there has not being good for a while   ill be going back to this place    but glad i gave it a go  
I was  asked how was my meal at one point half way though and i replied not great that its a little over done and he said ok very good   i presumed he didnt hear me   i think perhaps he was asking out of politness and didnt really want or expect to hear a complaint   im an easy going guy so i just left it   as over all the gentleman and the girl serbing us were nice
Ps i have never written a complaint/comment before and regret that i didnt take a photo so i could send you on the steak so you could see how over done it was  "
R0062,Highly recommended  Great food  delicious flavour combinations  superb wine
R0062,"I was embarrassed that having spoken so highly of this restaurant to my wife  and others that we had this unfortunate experience 

I left it until today because the ma�tre d indicated that they would be in touch  but obviously they havent "
R0062,"I am so disappointed to be writing this review  I have been here with my company a number of times over the years  but not recently  and was always very impressed with it  

I brought my wife as a treat for a special occasion   We arrived 20 minutes early and as our table was not ready we had a drink upstairs  no issue   

At the booked time we went down to the restaurant again but were left standing  waiting for a good 5/10 minutes before being seated  My wifes starter of scallops was good but my belly of pork was tepid and over cooked  

We both had rib eye steaks which arrived in a pan drowned in a thin/runny jus with no potatoes or vegetables  Unfortunately both of our steaks were very thin and chewy with little flavor or taste 

The waitress  the only positive of the whole night  asked if we enjoyed our meal I explained my disappointment and she notified the ma�tre d  2   one male and one female  who were perfunctory in their inquiry and clearly were just going through the motions  

It was an early sitting and whilst the restaurant didnt appear that busy the front of house gave the impression that they were under severe pressure "
R0062,I am sorry to say this was our most expensive yet least favorite meal while in dublin  We started with the pumpkin flatbread with mushrooms and pork belly which was ok  I had the salmon which in is itself was unseasoned and placed on a bed of lettuce and tomato with a hot  fishy  watery cream sauce that was inedible  My wife ordered the filet of beef in a tarragon sauce that was very salty  The waiter never checked in on is to see if we liked the meals  Would not recommend this place to anyone 
R0062,I ate in the restaurant on a busy Friday night  When our mains came out  mine didnt arrive and when it finally came out  after a very long wait  my partner had finished his meal  so it wasnt really the dining experience we had expected  I was very disappointed by this  However  I must compliment the manager Eoin and waitress who were looking after our table  When the matter was brought to their attention they handled the situation very professionally 
R0062,"I cant fault food but it is expensive for what you get  We paid almost 90 euros for just the chateaubriand for 2  Waitress recommended a weight that was far too big and we both eat big portions   2 seater tables are just so cramped and tiny and menus are enormous stiff leather ones   I could barely read it without knocking everything and sitting back form the table 
No starter  steak with sides and 1 dessert with a nice bottle of red wine was 200 euros without tip    not sure Id be rushing back "
R0062,I chose this restaurant  based on reviews  but hated it  It was so packed and noisy  with tables set out canteen style 
R0062,Food was relatively expensive  with little on the menu of interest to me  and my cauliflower was so over salted that it was almost inedible  I was gulping water throughout the night 
R0062,I felt the food was overly complicated and highly seasoned  Our waiter sat beside us to take our dinner and dessert order which was a bit too casual for me 
R0062,I found the restaurant very nice   but both starter and main courses were not hot      very disappointed   We mentioned it to the waitress who seemed uninterested   
R0062,"I got this deal on Friday afternoon  I rang the restaurant straight  away and there was no problem
with the time slot I wanted for Sunday evening  When we got there we were shown to our table 
straight away staff were very friendly  We more or less knew what we wanted as the deal showed what
was available on the menu  the food was beautiful neither too much nor too little just perfect  

The staff were very attentive   it was my partners first time dining there and he was very impressed  I have been there before with work functions   I would highly recommend this restaurant and I feel 
it was exceptional value for money "
R0062,I HAD BEEN HERE BEFORE  THOUGH IF MEMORY SERVES ME WELL WE WERE ALSO WAITING A LONG TIME FOR OUR MAIN COURSE THEN AND THE WAITRESS FORGOT SOME SIDES AND THE STEAK WAS MEDIUM NOT MEDIUM RARE AS REQUESTED  THIS TIME WE ONLY ORDERED A MAIN   THE WAITER WAS VERY GOOD AND ATTENTIVE BUT THE FOOD TOOK ALMOST 35/40 MINUTES TO ARRIVE  THE FOOD WAS NICE BUT NOT ALL THAT FOR THE PRICE PAID
R0062,I had one major setback as soon as I got there  They dont accept cards so I had to rush out again to find an ATM  Boooh 
R0062,Their menu is actually quite okay but does not have plenty of healthy options 
R0062,I love this place and the steaks they make  They make you feel like family and have great drinks
R0062,I ordered for delivery and had a bad vegan pie here  As someone unfamiliar with chain restaurants on the island  I supposed I expected too much from them  They were basically something you could get at any super market
R0062,I was extremely disappointed was expecting a lot more from this restaurant 
R0062,I really liked the ambiance and decor immediately upon arrival  The waiter was rushing us in ordering having put down menu  wine menu and cocktail menu and only allowing us a few minutes to look at these before asking us what we wanted  Ended up ordering wine per glass instead of bottle  The scallops starter was okay  not huge flavor and a bit of a dull presentation  My main course Halibut served with some kind of fennel and capers jus had no other taste than the salty flavor from the capers  The cauliflower side dish was cold  The new potatoes that my partner had with his salmon were raw and also not warm  his salmon was over cooked  Waiter didnt really pay attention to the fact that we ran out of drinks  I was extremely disappointed was expecting a lot more from this restaurant 
R0062,I see that there are a lot of good reviews and I can totally imagine that  The restaurant looks great and ticks all the boxes on how a modern restaurant should be  The flatbread we had for starters was great  Then the main course  I had a steak medium rare  Well  the steak was more rare then medium rare and the fat wasnt rendered correctly so it was kind of tough  How was this corrected  In a normal restaurant you would get a newly baked steak  because the steak was already cut and you cannot correct a cut steak from rare to medium rare  Well  in this restaurant they just tossed the steak into the oven and waited a few minutes  So the fat still wasnt rendered correctly and the meat was getting a bit dry  I had a steak on a hot stone the next day and that was many times better then this steak  So I think that we just had the wrong steak and this restaurant is a lot better then we received 
R0062,There is way better if you want a burger in town 
R0062,The worst part was that there was water all over the floor  my friend slipped and fell down an entire flight of stairs and really injured her leg  After her fall  four others slipped down the stairs also and there was not one member of staff to help any of them  I will not be returning here again 
R0062,I was expecting more from my visit having been voted best restaurant in Dublin and I heard a lot of positive feedback  but my experience on the night was food was mediocre  the carrot and tarragon salad had no tarragon that I could taste  how you could make that a main meal I dont know a bed of lettuce and some diced carrot for 8 euro  The colcannon wasnt very warm  the chips  tasted more like roast potatoes and the turbot was overcooked and just swimming in a sea of peas  Dont get me wrong overall it tasted okay but I dont think it was worth the money   We went for a special occasion and felt like we may as well have been  sitting with the customers on both tables either side of us 
R0062,Hugely overpriced for what we got   style over substance   we will not be returning 
R0062,I was really looking forward to visiting  this place but was disappointed with our experience  Our server was friendly  and  effecient but the tables were very close together  the restaurant was busy  and  incredibly noisy  the food was average at best
R0062,"I was very disappointed with my visit this time   I had such high expectations as I loved it the last time I was there and raved about it to many people to went along on my recommendation   
This visit we went for my boyfriends birthday   He had never been before   The menu was cut down because it was Christmas but I had not been informed of this when booking  There were certain items on the menu that were my reason for choosing this place for this event   Those items werent on the cut down menu   
We had fillet steak which was fantastic  probably the best steak Ive had all year and it was cooked perfectly "
R0062,I wasnt sure what to expect having been to other restaurants  but this was really  really good  The food was really good  and the service was great  I really liked the venue too with lots of space for the tables  and a very nice flow between the different areas  Highly recommend 
R0062,I wouldnt recommend going on a Saturday night it was so loud we couldnt here the hostess on arrival and we had to lip read the waiter when explaining the menu  The menu was good there was a great variety  we enjoyed our starters and mains consisting of chautaubriand steak and flat bread pizza  The food outwayed the atmosphere but I wont be rushing back unfortunately 
R0062,Ive eaten her a few times and generally the food has been good  However  we had a table booked for 6 30 and you are more than aware of the two hour table turnaround  At 8 22  the waiter asked us to pay our bill  which we did  At 8 32pm we were still sitting at the table and he came over again and started hassling us to leave  We had clearly finished our drinks and our bags were on the table and there were at least half a dozen vacant tables around us set up for new diners  While I dont agree with the practice of table turning  I know the rules but this just left us feeling harassed   Ive waited to be seated on a past occasion for diners to leave so this whole ethos seems inconsistent at best  End result  I wont be returning 
R0062,Ive eaten here a few times and its consistently excellent  It is a little pricey but its definitely worth it  Side dishes are incredible and sauces used are amazing  Ive never tasted anything like it  Im highly recommend this restaurant 
R0062,Incredible original dishes  The service is excellent and the Cocktails were the best    Fantastic buzz x Will definitely be back 
R0062,It had excellent food and truly outstanding service 
R0062,It is a lovely atmosphere and the food is simply amazing  And the cocktails  gorgeous 
R0062,It was very busy so ended up waiting an hour for food  Ordered lamb but was given fillet steak and charged for it also  Heard from a friend it was nice but cant really recommend it myself
R0062,Just stunning food  service and atmosphere  looking forward to next visit 
R0062,Love this place and its staff  Would highly recommend it 
R0062,Love this place  food is fabulous  staff are very nice too  Always go back
R0062,Loved it   We r visiting Dublin from the US  Beautiful cocktails and food 
R0062,Loved the food  lots of good and unusual choices  but big  crowded and very busy atmosphere means its not a relaxing experience  Tables are allocated for 2 hours only so the service is rushed with barely time to read the dessert menu  Glad we tried it but it did feel like they were doing us a favour allowing us to eat there  Prefer a more relaxing dining experience and when paying these prices expect to be out for the evening not just 2 hours 
R0062,Lovely atmosphere  Food was delicious and service spot on 
R0062,Lovely food  awful service  Seated  waited 20 mins for menus  Ordered food  very good  Once plates were cleared were not offered dessert menu or coffee  Waited almost an hour for any contact once dinner plates were taken  at that point we asked for the bill  Thankfully no service charge as I would have refused to pay it  Would not rush back 
R0062,The staff were particularly bad; unknowledgeable  unhelpful and unfriendly  We wont be back 
R0062,I and my comppanion found the room to be too loud  We wont be back 
R0062,"Meat was not cooked as requested  Medium rare was well done and chewy for both me and my friend 
Place was too noisy  it was really difficult to have a conversation 
Service was very good "
R0062,Mediocre food at expensive prices  Pizza was nothing exciting  Steak was fatty and lamb was just okay   Not worth the prices
R0062,"Mixed experience  The Maitre D who we first met was lovely  very charming and welcoming and explained the menu to us as we were first time diners  Our waiter who came to take our order was quite the opposite  One friend is a vegetarian and the menu is to say the least sparse for veggies   The only ""option"" she was given was to pick a couple of items from the sides menu  Fair play to her  she is a seasoned diner and challenged the waiter who was reluctantly forced to ask the chef if there were any other options  He came back with a tapas menu from the other restaurant  He made us feel really uncomfortable  like we were the most difficult customers  I shared a chateaubriand with my other friend  It was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten"
R0062,Monday night  8 15  Restaurant packed  menu really interesting and unusual in a good way  Food excellent and ambience lively and service superb  Highly recommended 
R0062,"Mothers Day meal  no mothers day chocolates or  Euro 10 voucher was given to her  

I would appreciate if someone would follow up on this as this is the only reason I booked  Was to make my mother feel special  but I didnt see anything special whatsoever  except for the glass of bubbly "
R0062,My friends and I had a very enjoyable experiencep  It was one of our favorite restaurants on our trip to Ireland  Some of the best food we had and great service  Highly recommend 
R0062,My husband and I ate dinner here recently  Simply put  the food was fantastic  but the service was horrible  The waiter was dismissive and inattentive  We felt generally ignored  which made an otherwise delicious meal  disappointing 
R0062,My husband and I didnt feel there was much on the menu for our preference   My husband didnt order a starter as there wasnt one he liked   We ordered chunky fries as a side and got bacon fries with truffle oil   but as we hadnt been there before  we just thought thats how they come   It was only when we got the bill  we realised we were given the wrong ones  which we didnt really like  as the truffle oil was overpowering    We found it over priced and unfortunately wont be going back
R0062,"Myself and my partner tried this place after I heard so much hype about it  I was quite disappointed though  Like the other place the food was way too salty  and  the wedges were quite hard to eat 
I found the beef good apart from all the salt 
I would probably not be back unless they lowered the sodium level "
R0062,Myself and my OH went last Wednesday 24th June  I had  made a booking for 6:45 and we arrived at that time and were greeted and shown straight to our table in the restaurant  We were propmtly served water  then wine/beer and then our food order was taken  All perfectly timed  Every memeber of staff from the hostess to waiters to bus boy were all  very friendly and acommodating  The service is extremely professional yet super friendly and relaxed which is a difficult balance to perfect  But this place does  effortlessly  I had scallops to start and himself had smoked salmon  He had a well done steak  for main  perfectly cooked to his liking   and huge chips   I had the trout and cauliflower and we shared a salad  The food was hands down amazing  The best meal Ive had out in a long time  The drinks  wine  beer  cocktails   were al superb too  We went up  to the cocktail bar after dinner and again were really well looked after  We had such a lovely evening  I would highly recommend to everyone and anyone  High quality food  drink and service without any of the pretentiousness  We will definitely be back 
R0062,Never disappoints  Fabulous food and cocktails  friendly and helpful staff 
R0062,"Nice welcome  lovely ambience but a few issues

 1  Our aperitif drinks order never arrived 

 2  we ordered the same meat main course  cooked two different ways   however when they arrived one was undercooked and in a sauce  while the other had a completely different sauce on the side   we just couldnt understand how the same order could be presented completely differently 

 3  we waited 15 mins with the desert menu closed in front of us before having to call a waiter ourselves  at that point we took a rain check on coffee and requested the bill   

Sadly  having to call the waiting staff wasnt uncommon on the night 

We had been for tapas previously  which was excellent  However  the restaurant was poor on a number of levels  much to our disappointment"
R0062,No really very good  nothing wrong but the fries were uninspiring  and the meat was not particularly good either  The place was very noisy  although with a good ambience  more like a party than a private dinner  While the place could be nice at the right occasion  the food we got was really not worth going for   
R0062,Noisy dining room  Starter and Banofee were great but main courses disappointing   guiness stew not great   chewy and undercooked  Fillet steak also served rare when requested medium well
R0062,Probably good if part of a group  but not good as a romantic venue 
R0062,"Noisy  cramped  slow inefficient service  and not a pleasant dining ""experience"" at all  It was so bad that we walked 20 minutes after arriving and before anyone came to take out order  The food looked good  but I expect a more refined environment for the price "
R0062,Not a good dining experience Im afraid   The food was ok   not great but not completely horrible   the wine was good but very expensive if you wanted anything decent   the staff were the only good thing about the restaurant   they were friendly and helpful   It was noisy  uncomfortable and I didnt like the ambience one bit   I felt like I was in a large barn and having dinner with the people beside me 
R0062,Not so good  the meat was obviously bad and the waitress said she was going to ask what she could do  after the third time asking for the bill we left as fast as we could  will not go back unfortunately
R0062,omg totally disaster
R0062,OMG  this place really just impressed us completely  The ambiance is awesome  very trendy/laid back  Being from Chicago   we are sorta culinary snobs  but the food here was really second to none  We each had the stews  and both the beef stew and the lamb stew had such amazing rich flavors  Then for sides  the cauliflower is so flavorful and unique  The staff was very friendly and when things got a bit hectic and our dessert  which was amazing  took a bit longer than expected  they took it off the bill  and  gave us complimentary coffees  Highly highly recommend 
R0062,"On our very last night in Dublin  we dined in the Creative Quarter  on the recommendation of our cab driver and we were not disappointed  The food is excellent  locally sourced and prepared/plated perfectly  The service was very good  and the decor and ambience were exceptional 
After 12 days of great restaurants split between London  Galway and Dublin  this was exactly the high note we wanted to end our trip  From the moment we walked in to the moment we left  we loved every minute and would highly recommend it to anyone "
R0062,"Our starter was great  scallops   But we both didnt enjoy the mains  we just didnt like the taste  My husband received the wrong side and the dessert wasnt how he ordered it either  
The restaurant has a nice ambience but after this occasion  we would not return "
R0062,"Our table was located in a corner under a ledge on which staff sat  It was also under a fire oven  and  sink that was blocked as there was a bad smell  I informed waitress but no other tables free 
Food expensive  too many tables  and  meal rushed "
R0062,Outstanding  We enjoyed every minute of the visit  The food was exceptionally good and we were stunned by the service quality  Relaxed atmosphere  great bar upstairs for those who fancy a drink before the dinner  Highly recommended 
R0062,"Outstanding  it takes your breath away     
Best regards from Finland                    "
R0062,Overall the experience was god but the tables are very close to each other  making access to your chair very difficult and having a conversations with your  guest difficult because of the noise and been overheard
R0062,Pick your own entree from a chalk written availability   A lot of fun and wonderful food
R0062,pizza was superb  staff were really friendly and there was a lovely warm environment  loved it  and its BYO
R0062,Poor excuse for a buffet or Chinese food  Most food was quite dry and bland  Fri eve  at 7:30 pm   Quite disappointed  Hope the soft serve ice cream will at least get the bad taste out of my mouth 
R0062,Poor selection of vegetarian options and very poor selection of vegan options 
R0062,poor value for money for what we got   the food was basic  no vegetables for example 
R0062,"Pretty disappointed with the food in this place  The rib eye was incredibly tough  and definitely not worth the 36 euro I paid for it  Ive frequently had better steak from Tesco  

My vegetarian partner was told the salads ordered as a large version would substitute for a main  What turned up was literally a bag of leaves tipped into a bowl  with 3 slices of carrot in it  Definitely not a main  one of the worst salads Ive ever seen  and not worth the price on the menu 

Chunky Chips and charred cauliflower were delicious   and the waiter was lovely  
Great service  but really sub par food for the menu prices  Wouldnt recommend this place to anyone and wont be going back "
R0062,Probably one of the worst pasta dish I ve ever had  Pasta itself were good but the mushroom y puku sauce on them made me sick just by the look of it 
R0062,Quality of food below par  Not representative of the cost 
R0062,Really expensive  I had the special duck  Euro 35 but it was far too undercooked so I had to send it back  The accompaniments were not nice  Dessert was literally just a bowl of melted Cadburys dairy milk  Very disappointing 
R0062,Really great tasting food  Everything was prepared perfectly and had amazing flavours
R0062,Really loved the waiters being so attentive but not in your face 
R0062,"Really nice place for killing Mexican cravings   

We ordered nachos as a started and it was really good

Then we ordered tacos and I think the price is a bit higher for only 2 tacos  but it was ok since the taste was amazing 

The staff is really nice and the decoration is great  "
R0062,Sadly very poor quality food
R0062,Sadly  I wasnt very impressed with the fish and chips at this restaurant  I found the fish to be somewhat tasteless and greasy 
R0062,Second year going here however this yr was disappointing  Servers very quick to push the more expensive menu and wine  Dessert really poor  Overall the experience wasnt as positive as last yr 
R0062,"Service was appalling  We waited 45 minutes for a table booked 2 weeks previously  Waited ages for drinks  menus and the bill  

My steak was very nice "
R0062,"Service was forced given us the feeling we should leave ASAP 
Given that we spent almost 500 euro this left us with a feeling that it was more important for them to sell the table one more time"
R0062,Service was good in the restaurant  When leaving  the staff member at the cost check refused to retrieve our coats  She insisted we look for them ourselves while she looked on with another team member  Really left a sour taste after  Wont be back 
R0062,"Service was really good  friendly efficient staff  the food though was mediocre  I expected more  I had oysters for starter  they were piled high with ice  there was no flavour as all  no condiments offered  not even lemon  the herb on the oyster tasted like dry grass 

I had fillet beef for main  the sauce was extremely rich with cream  the filet had sinew through the middle and the mushrooms were hard/chewy 

My date had the pork belly  the crackling was like a piece of titanium  impossible to cut  the pork itself was tough 

It wasnt bad  but for the prices and the reputation  I was disappointed "
R0062,Service was superb   best eve Ive had in a long time
R0062,"Service was very professional   We were among the first to be there and first impression was that tables are too close together   We were lucky we had finished before it got too busy  so we did not have someone ""on top of us"" 
The main course of pork chop and Denver steak were flavoursome and very enjoyable 
The starters and dessert were not up to the same standard as the mains 
The pork belly was too fatty   Pork belly is fatty  but with long slow cooking the fat renders down   The cracking was not true crackling   Overall it seems to have been flashed under a grill 
The mashed potatoes were like baby food 
The desserts of banoffi and rhubarb were bland and again  not unlike baby food 
I must emphasise that staff were very friendly and efficient "
R0062,Slowest fast food on the planet  Shown to a table and after 10 minutes hailed a languid waitress who seemed surprised at being asked to take an order  Beer arrived promptly enough but another 15 minutes before burger appeared after accosting yet another disinterested server the excuse being that 15 minutes is normal for food delivery 
R0062,With the prices that are charged we had expected a much higher standard of food  Tables are also placed much too close to each other 
R0062,"So disappointing  Ordered fillet steak medium/well done and it was rare  The desserts were very poor  My friends reactions to their  Euro 11 chocolate sphere dessert was is this all it is  My friends bannoffe dessert was just pure liquid that she said she could just pick up and drink  No texture at all  My pineapple dessert was incredibly basic and lacking any creativity or depth of flavour  
Overall  the experience was very disappointing"
R0062,"Mediocre food which was not cheap 
Would not recommend"
R0062,Sorry to be negative  loved it before not great this time
R0062,Staff so nice a little bit cold food nice      I will try it again
R0062,Staff were lovely   Service good   However our table for 2 was pushed underneath the bar    it rocked and was supported by a lump of paper   Red wine was cold   Husbands food was  overcooked and possibly had been round for a while   My fish was very salty   On complaint staff were great but we will not be rushing back 
R0062,Started our NYE here  Fantastic drinks at the bar  highly recommend the �riot squad� cocktail if you like your rum   This was followed by delicious food in he restaurant  The truffle mushroom ravioli was exceptional and my fillet steak was cooked nicely  Its a little on the expensive side but totally worth it  The tables are close together and the atmosphere is on the loud side but we didnt mind that  Can understand why it might be perceived as too loud for others  Highly recommend 
R0062,Starters and desserts were poor  The expensive sides were slightly cold  The food came out fast and our waiter was very attentive  Ive worked in the industry for 8 years and expected more  It was extremely average and terribly over priced  The meal cost us  Euro 150 and I didnt even have an alcoholic drink 
R0062,Steak was delicious but sides were only lukewarm  Drinks were quite slow in coming to the table  Overall disappointing as it was a 60th birthday and felt we didnt get the food or service youd expect for such a expensive restaurant 
R0062,Such a pleasure wonderful food attentive service great wine and prosecco
R0062,Super Food  Great Staff   nice atmosphere  highly recommend
R0062,"Food was lovely but lukewarm by time it got to us 
Staff were friendly and efficient but there wasnt one designated person looking after us which meant lengthy wait for dessert menu and paying 
We were looking forward to eating here given its profile but we were decidedly underwhelmed  We would not recommend it to others "
R0062,"Tables too close together 
Not enough room for staff to pass by our table with resultant hitting against us "
R0062,Terrible experience  We ate early but got no attention as service team were more concerned about their own things  Food was forgotten  cold  Took 3 hours for starter/main course although we were in at 6 with only a handful of other tables in for dinner  Wine service was non existent 
R0062,Terrible experience  Took the left overs to go which was presented in a lovely dunnes stores bag 
R0062,"Thanks for having us   You guys were outstanding  

Greeting from Belgium"
R0062,The ambience was really noisy  Impossible to talk or even listen to the staff  Even though they were kind  we could not take advantage of their advice or orientation  Good food  however it was difficult to enjoy 
R0062,The attention from the staff when we arrived was great  Our orders were taken and the food delivered in good time  The food was beautiful and I couldnt fault it  However as soon as our desserts had been handed to us it was as if the ground opened up and swallowed us   literally nobody came near us again AT ALL  We were not offered coffee  not asked if we wanted more water   nothing  The place became so unbearably hot that we needed water and then we realised how long we had been sitting there  We decided to leave but we couldnt get staff to bring us our bill so we went over to the till and waited for somebody to come by  It was a very disappointing end to a lovely meal 
R0062,"The Beef and Guinness Stew  is a mislabelled Beef Stroganoff  A stew is something that you eat in a bowl with a spoon  whereas this was a curry which they expected me to eat with knife and fork  Its bowl of beef  beans and white soup  where on earth you get that colour from the Guinness Ill never know   couldnt really eat it 

Sides are not included and definitely needed  Either include it in the price  you know  being expert chefs Id expect you to be able to chose a side that accompanies the dish   or at least advise the customer to order one 

On the flip side  the starter was lovely  the other persons main looked nice  deserts  cocktails and wine were all lovely  just a pity that I had to go home and eat more "
R0062,The cabbage soup is a must try  something extraordinary and so tasty
R0062,The food is absolutely delicious  but the electro music in the restaurant is awful and has completely messed up my diner  I could barely hear and talk to the person I was eating with 
R0062,Regarding this type of restaurant I was expecting a nice and cosy atmosphere and not feel like I am eating in a Pub 
R0062,"The food was delicious and amazing cocktails  The staff were very friendly and helpful 
I definitely would come back there "
R0062,The food was excellent  Never pass the scallops  Just amazing 
R0062,The food was fantastic  but our server was dreadful 
R0062,"The food was nice  maybe a little overpriced for just a cod dish without any sides   The food took quite a while to be served and then when we went to order a dessert and another bottle of wine   we were told we had to vacate the table in ten minutes   which we hadnt been advised when we came in  

The waitress told us to take our bottle of wine upstairs to the bar and advised there would be ample seating  when we arrived up  the whole bar had been reserved and so we had no other choice but to go out onto the roof top in freezing conditions to finish our drinks  

All in all  the food was nice but the service was poor "
R0062,The food was not good and overpriced  Pretentious food  the cauliflower soup had two disks of salmon in it and a piece of brocolli  The flavours didnt work well  The parmesan sauce was overpowering with the cod  the cod was swimming in this sauce  We didnt stay for desert   
R0062,The food wasnt great and it was way overpriced  We will not be back 
R0062,The main course is overpriced  100 g of lamb for over 30 pounds  London is cheaper  The restaurant area is soulless
R0062,The meat was very well cooked but most dishes were ridiculously over complicated   Why do chips need to be in a kind of yellow sauce with bits of bacon and then drowned in parmesan  for example   And the starters each had about 15 ingredients in   Maybe I just prefer simple  good ingredients  well cooked   The biggest disappointment was the noise   Its like eating in a dark football stadium   Shouting and screaming echoing all around 
R0062,The overall experience felt like being part of a very efficient assembly line process  No atmosphere  no value on you as a customer and poor service  We only had a two hour window which was emphasised in email after email and it would have been impossible to have a meal within this window if we hadnt constantly worked hard to get the attention of the waiting staff  The flatbread was a very large cream cracker with a mean skimming of a topping and at a what a price  My salmon was bone dry and when I complained about it I will credit the staff with giving our dessert FOC  Wine was very good  Dessert was good  It was rushed  For  Euro 100+ it was very poor  It spoiled a birthday treat and we will not be back 
R0062,"The place is clearly overrated 
Not coming back "
R0062,"Food was anything but good  service was poor  the French waitress was clearly not enjoying her job that night or  even worse  thought she was superior to us   the wine list is short and badly explains what each bottle is  and the bill was   well  actually it was the only thing that turned out to be as expected  expensive  
We were looking forward to having a nice and special dinner and came out clearly disappointed 
Not coming back "
R0062,"The food is overpriced for what it is and they even charge you for bread  Fine dining it is not  It was my boyfriends birthday and the waitress forgot to bring out the little birthday cake for him 

I will not be back"
R0062,"the place is packed with tables and the waiting staff appear too busy to deal with everyone in the restaurant 

I will not be back"
R0062,The quality of food are not at the minimun level for this place
R0062,"The restaurant is a nice spot in the middle of the city 

We had booked the table for 4 people and they gave us two individual table which they have a difference high between esch table of 3 5 cm  therefore we had some difficulties for sharing some dishes because of that  

We tried to change the table but they did not have another table for us 

We order a woodfure foccacia  which was very good and taste and then a meat for sharing but we had to wait dor between starter and main course more than 40 minutes  one side of cube potatoes and bacon come cold 


The waitress never offer coffee or a liquor after the dessert and gave the bills 

Low experience for the price paid "
R0062,The restaurant itself was really nice and the staff were lovely but the portions were too small  We ordered the t bone lamb to share which cost 60 euro but I only had 3 mouthfuls of lamb    The sides it came with were lovely but we left hungry  Dont go here if you want value for money 
R0062,The restaurant was nice and service was great but I ordered tuna dish and frankly struggled to find actual signs of tuna  The flat bread was dry and heavy  The wine was really good and dessert was tasty and fab  Overall main dishes were disappointing so wouldnt go back 
R0062,The service is exemplary  The staff are wonderfully professional and make sure guests are well cared for   Sadly the food on this visit did not meet this standard   We shared a bone in ribeye for six and a variety of sides   The sides were well prepared and nicely presented and just not that interesting   The ribeye was also beautifully prepared and nicely presented sliced in a copper pan  Unfortunately it was served quite rare when it was supposed to be medium rare  you cant send a plate of meat served for six back at a business dinner  and more unforgivable it simply wasnt a good steak  it was tough and loaded with gristle   Just not a good experience

R0062,"The start of the night was ruined by a rude waitress telling us to hurry up and order
 Experience will depend on who you are served by "
R0062,The worst meal I had in Dublin 
R0062,"Greeted with rude service at the door and unavailability of our table  Eventually seated in a loud yet soulless dining room  Our menu was a confused hodgepodge  ""Flatbread"" ordered as a starter looked and tasted like processed own brand frozen pizza from a budget supermarket  Mains  turbot and lamb  were both overcooked  Everything was horribly over salted "
R0062,This is a perfect location serving a perfect Irish stew 
R0062,This is a well known restaurant  but it does not live up to its hype  The menu is attempting to be gastro chic but falls short  even if the prices dont  Its also one of the nosiest restaurants ive experienced  The brick walls and high ceilings bounce sounds around so much you can barely hear those at your table   I wont go back 
R0062,This place has changed so much for the worse esp the last 5 years there portions of chips are tiny the fish is tiny and there bill is crazy expensive staff are busy but nice  Theyve �really let them selfs down with the portion sizes   so mean  and disrespectful to the loyal customer like me  sad
R0062,This really should NOT have been the first place I ate in Dublin  I had it on a list due to online reviews  but wow  NOT all that  Zero atmosphere  so so pies  and nearly empty  Pro tip: dont bother 
R0062,This restaurant is very expensive for what you get  18 euros for a cracker flat bread with minimal ingredients and 27 euros for a 250 gram piece of salmon with no sides is rediculous  Would not have been the case if the food had knocked our socks off  but was mediocre and lacked flavor 
R0062,We started the evening with a drink which was fine but after that it was down hill  The menu is suppose be for sharing but all they had was a few starters  a couple of salads and flatbread pizzas  The rest was meat selections and off the board meat selections  We ordered two appetizers to start and one was the sea trout  Instead of that they brought duck liver  Neither were very flavorable  I ordered the rib eye for my main dish which was too well done and was dripping in red sauce  Needless to say I left there still hungry  We went back to our hotel for dessert  It was definitely not worth it  There are so many delicious restaurants in Dublin dont be tempted by this one 
R0062,This restaurant was chaotic 
R0062,The service was appalling  our drinks arrived as we were finishing our dinner despite being ordered at the same time the waiter took our initial order  We had to ask for them twice  We also had to order our dessert twice and were still waiting 20 25 minutes for it  The apology we received when we complained was perfunctory and insincere  The portion sizes were very small and very expensive  On the plus side the mashed potatoes were very good 
R0062,This was a truly disappointing dining experience The only recommendation I can give is to avoid  avoid  avoid 
R0062,"This was my first visit to your restaurant  I was accompanied by a work colleague and an external supplier  
The food was absolutely fantastic  I had chosen the salmon in crab and lemongrass sauce and a side of colcannon  The colcannon was beautiful  
The service that we received from the staff was 10/10  The staff were extremely helpful and knowledgeable without being intrusive  
There was a real buzz in the restaurant  The ambiance was perfect  especially for a lovely  sunny evening in Dublin  I would highly recommend for a bite to eat "
R0062,This was my third time to eat at Restaurant  I was very happy with food previously but last Thursday the starter was lovely but the both mains were tiny and alot of fat on the lamb  and  the steak was not good either  We spent 200euro and were asked abruptly to leave the table  I understand the table is needed but no need to ask so abruptly  We spent a lot of money  and  were rushed out of the place 
R0062,"Thought it was expensive for what it was  Got scallop starter and was basically mash with deep fried scollaps and holandaise not much skill required for a  Euro 15 starter 

Steak was nice but overpriced and didnt like to room was very much like a canteen   Wouldnt return"
R0062,To much noise  and the music was to loud  we had to talk very loud to each other   unpleasent  The room was to dark so it was impossible to se the menu or the board  Not a place I will recommend to any adults 
R0062,Too expensive  No value for money   Small portions for paying price  Good taste
R0062,"Unfortunately I did not enjoy my experience   While my meal was adequate my companions meal was barely edible  The couple seated next to us complained about their meal also to two waitresses  The first girl just smiled and walked away  This is an inappropriate way to deal with a customer  The other girl dealt with the complaint in a much better manner  
I felt the service was rushed  while I was aware there is a two hour limit on a table I was disappointed that from the moment I walked in the door to the moment I left was 75 mins    For a three course meal  Overall not great "

R0062,"We ordered the scallops and pork belly for starters and while both were nice  they were only just that  the flavour you would expect pork belly to be bursting with wasnt there 

Our main course was the nail in the coffin though  We both ordered fillet steak  medium  My steak was over cooked and was extremely tough  I sent it back  may I complememt our waiter in his handling of this  However  the replacement was simply just cooked a lot less so as to presumably alleviate some of the toughness but unfortunately  it didnt work  Both steaks were also cold as were the side of croquettes 

While I understand  everyone can have their off nights and I would always give a place the benefit of the doubt  on this occasion  the disappointment was just too much and
I would seriously consider not returning again 

Apologies for the moan but I hope youd rather know my thoughts than say nothing at all "
R0062,"Unfortunately  this wasnt a pleasurable dining experience  Having ate in the tapas bar and in the restaurant on numerous occasions for business lunches  I choose this place for an anniversary with my girlfriend 

On arrival  our table wasnt ready  not a problem as we were in no rush  On being seated  we noticed how cold the restaurant was  with some diners eating dinner while wearing their coats  Luckily for me  I wanted a chilled bottle of beer but the chilled red wine my girlfriend received was less than satisfactory "
R0062,Vacation  Excellent meal  and  service  New take on Irish food  Loved the steaks  and  cauliflower 
R0062,"Very busy and service quite slow and a bit all over the place  

Have eaten here many times and food not as good as it used to be: duck liver starter a real let down with no subtlety of flavor or creativity  Fillet beef was ok but not amazing for  Euro 36   a bit dry overall  

A bit disappointed overall   usually top notch but theyve removed some great stuff from the menu"
R0062,Very disappointed   hadnt been here in over a year  Found the waitress a little too enthusiastic and not really capable of reading the customer  Had Chateaubriand that was chargrilled   something we werent made aware of that it would be cooked that way   ruined the taste  Dropped  Euro 200 here and being left underwhelmed was disappointing 
R0062,Very disappointed  I live abroad and had heard a lot about this restaurant  It didnt live up to expectations at all  over priced for mediocre food 
R0062,"Very disappointing to say the least 
This was a different food experience  we bought the taste voucher  3 course meal with a bottle of wine   The starters were tasty  scallops  however mains and deserts were really average  Portion size was ridiculous and we both left the restaurant hungry and feeling hard done by as we were expecting an experience similar to Dylans other restaurant  One copper pot of mash potato; that was so creamy it fell between the fork is not really acceptable  were a spud gobbler nation

R0062,Very disappointing  The service and food is just not up to the standards of other Dublin restaurants in a similar or less expensive bracket  When we arrived we were left standing holding our coats at the table and the menus were left on another table which I had to stand up and retrieve  Service overall is poor and not very friendly  Food was ok but nothing special and I really object to having to pay for vegetables  Only redeeming feature was that it was busy so a decent buzz in the room  There are far better places to go in Dublin than this Restaurant  Disappointed as I have previously enjoyed this part of the venue 
R0062,Very expensive  Main course came just as we had finished starter  no break
R0062,Very friendly staff  great atmosphere and amazing food  Absolutely loved it 
R0062,Very good as per usual   really good food and atmosphere
R0062,"Very poor service   our wine was left in ice bucket at another table   we spent half our main course with empty glasses before we could get someone to locate our wine 

Waitress never returned with our change

Food was good"
R0062,Very poor value      extremely small portions for side orders   Salmon very plain   could buy same in Dunnes for  Euro 5   way way out at  Euro 24   Disappointed no chicken on menu   Just really expensive for what we got
R0062,Very slow  music far too loud  food mediocre  not value for money 
R0062,Was a little disappointed at the quality of the food  we had pork belly to start and fillet steak for main   lack of small touches such as bread for the table  and the price was very high considering the quality  We very much regret not booking for the Tapas part of the restaurant instead where we have had great experiences 
R0062,Was quite dissappointing based on my last visit   The Bar was very enjoyable and staff there very friendly   When we were brought to our table we ordered 2 glasses of wine which we duly received   By the time our main courses arrived we had finished our wine and ordered 2 more glasses   We were over half way through our dishes and the wine had still not arrived   We called a member of staff who went to check and then told us the order had not being submitted   It was my wifes birthday so was a special night and have to say I was very disappointed with this place as this and the fact that both of us thought that the food was not as good as our previous visit   So all in all not a positive visit for either us 
R0062,Was a dissappointing experience based on my last visit  Service was terrible and slow  Waited on wine for ages
R0062,"Was really looking forward to dining here having read all the hype for abroad  I was visiting home from London for the rugby and booked for 9:30 pm that evening  There were 4 of us   the service was average  not engaging  the tables were cramped and the food a standar gastropub fayre for London 
I would probably not come again  there are other restaurants out there doing a better job at the same pricepoint "
R0062,We  to request early bird menu rather  than it being given to us when we arrived Food was delicious
R0062,NEVER EVER AGAIN We were approached by one of the managers who totally spoke down to use and basically insisted we finish our coffees at the bar 
R0062,We arrived at 7 00pm  sharp  we were shown to our table and then proceeded to order our starter the waiter did not take our main course order which we all thought was very strange  While eating our starter the waiter proceded to ask us for our main course we then were asked to finish our coffee at the bar at 8 50pm as our table was required back for 9 00pm which I do find totally rude and a pure money make fiasco   Then without asking for the bill it arrived  We then left and waited 10 minutes trying to get our coats in the end we actually has to get them ourselves    NEVER EVER AGAIN 
R0062,Not sure if we will go back again with the many dining options in Dublin 
R0062,We decided to eat here based on reviews   My daughter and I ordered the lamb stew for two and it was terrible   Large chunks of lamb that were too tough to cut with a knife  never mind eat   I grew up in an Irish household and have visited Ireland many many times and have never seen lamb stew with large chunks of meat   The meat in any stew  when cooked appropriately  should be tender   Not sure if this was meaningful   when we ordered our meals the waiter asked if we ever had lamb stew before   The waiter did not charge us for the lamb stew as he knew the large chunks were not edible   One good note    my wifes beef stew was very good   
R0062,We had a great evening and food was amazing  we were delighted with our experience  Waiter was so friendly and chef specially cooked portion veg for our baby who is one and half  Honestly nowhere can compare with this place  real food and really tastie  Unforgettable evening  thanks  Highly recommend a visit
R0062,We had a lovely night  no complaints at all on anything  thank you 
R0062,We had a really wonderful dining experience  We were there as a couple and we were able to enjoy each others conversation but also benefit from the atmosphere created by other diners and staff  The food was exceptional with plenty of choice and the staff were more than capable of explaining the menu and making recommendations  After dining we enjoyed the spectacular choice of cocktails in the warm surrounding of the cocktail lounge and ended up staying much longer than we had intended too  Again  the staff in the lounge could not have been more friendly or helpful  We would highly recommend to couples and groups 
R0062,We had an absolutely wonderful time here   The food is wonderful   The service is amazing   And the place had an amazing lively vibe     Highly recommended 
R0062,"We had heard good things about this restaurant and so had it on our to do list while in Dublin 
It absolutely lived up to expectation  Great service  fabulous food  varied wine list and a buzzing atmosphere  Highly recommended "
R0062,We had our 1st wedding anniversary  Unbelievable food  atmosphere and service  Staff were so friendly and were so efficient for the amount of tables they had to serve  The timing between courses was perfect  Would highly recommend to friend and family  It was also a lovely touch the staff bringing out a cake and candle to mark the occasion for us  Went for a few cocktails upstairs with some interesting selections  really good 
R0062,We made a reservation for both the cocktail bar and for the restaurant  When we arrived only the restaurant booking was on the system  They managed to accommodate us for cocktails anyway after a bit of confusion at the front desk   which was great  however when we got to the restaurant we where waiting over an hour for our starter to arrive and another decent wait between courses  The waiter was very nice and the highlight was the wine and trout starter  However  overall an average experience  would not be rushing back 
R0062,"We received a gift voucher and arrived before our booking time but were seated promptly 

We found the food beautiful but were disappointed with the ambience in general  It seemed to us the restaurant was overcrowded in that there were too many tables making the place cluttered  The general mood seemed to be    Get the people in  get them fed and get them out  Because the place was crowded and the tables were so close together  we could hear the conversations around us and there was a general air of loudness in the place 

While the quality of food was excellent  it got lost amidst the above mentioned factors "
R0062,We waited for about 15 minutes after we arrived for service  When it did appear  we were given the wrong menus  We had ordered a Rewarding Times voucher and were disappointed with the food offering for that voucher 
R0062,We were disappointed having had great experiences with the tapas in the past  Service was slow   30 mins before anyone asked if we wanted a drink and 45 mins between starter and main course  My wife had the mushroom ravioli which was 2 slivers pasta and a shovel of mushrooms and my fillet steak was overdone and dry  and expensive   We left without desert or coffee because the whole experience was just a bit flat 
R0062,We were having a lovely evening for my sons birthday until a group of 36 arrived and filled the 2 tables next to us  For the rest of the meal we could hardly hold a conversation because of the noise levels in the restaurant  We ate our meal completely under pressure and were aware that other diners were also upset   We eventually asked to be moved and we were taken upstairs to have our coffee which was nice and quiet  The food was delicious but I thought as a courtesy we may have got a free coffee but no  nothing was done as an acknowledgment that the meal had been ruined  Pity as the food was excellent  
R0062,We were told that they were sold out of an item on the menu  but after waiting for our order  we saw that this was still being served to another customer who was behind us in the queue  When we asked  we were actually told that if we spoke Cantonese  we would have gotten what we wanted 
R0062,We were very disappointed in this restaurant   The food was average at best  and for the price  a very poor value   The flatbreads/pizzas were good  but the main courses were undercooked or overcooked and very bland 
R0062,"Weve been here several times before but this time was a bit disappointing  The food has always been out of this world but on this occasion we both got the pork belly and the denver roll  I got the croquettes and my partner got chips  Everything that came out was tepid/warm instead of hot  The food defiantly wasnt as nice as last time 
Also during our meal one of the chefs starting swearing really loudly at someone else in the kitchen about a backpack  It really ruined the atmosphere and the whole restaurant stopped and stared but he kept going 
All the rest of the staff including our servers were really lovely though 
Overall we spent nearly  Euro 200  including tip  on a meal for two which for what we received was quite a let down  As I said weve been here many times before but we both agreed we would try somewhere else next time were in Dublin"
R0062,Well informed table staff  great food and variety on menu   consistently good 
R0062,Went there because of online reviews and sorely disappointed    Menu is ilegible and food was dreadful   place is also filthy   Avoid avoid avoid  
R0062,What a delicious meal and great atmosphere  Love everything about this place 
R0062,The nightclub is a room with a bar and to charge in is ironic given how bad it is  This place is only surviving due to being part of the centre 
R0062,Wonderful food  will definitely return  
R0063,Beautiful birthday meal  Amazing food  wine and service 
R0063,Beautiful restaurant and fabulous staff  A really nice treat  thank you  
R0063,Excellent as always  Evening well spent
R0063,Excellent food  Must visit
R0063,Excellent food service and ambiance  Would definitely recommend 
R0063,Excellent food  perfectly prepared  Nice ambience and really friendly and professional staff 
R0063,Excellent food  service and great value for money 
R0063,Very good pub food  The fish and chips were cooked to perfection  Not greasy or over coated with batter  Friendly service and fun atmosphere 
R0063,"

The decor of the restaurant is so old  The room feels so empty  including the tiny and sad Christmas decorations they put on couches  The place is so sad I wanted to leave the minute I arrived    

The menu was so basic also   if I go out and eat at a restaurant I do not want to pay  Euro 25 for chicken  

This restaurant needs a major revamp to keep it up with the competition  no wonder it was pretty much empty  

The market at street level is a total different story  they are an institution in Dublin and the only place where you can get decent food "
R0063,A good restaurant  but running out of key featured menu items by 1930hrs on a Saturday night is not acceptable   only one portion of duck left  no lamb T bone  no veal for 2 and reasonable portions of beef all gone   Food we had was good  but fell short of our hopes 
R0063,A lovely  romantic restaurant with delicious food and attentive service   There are food options for every eater 
R0063,Absolutely amazing food   very friendly staff  and  most definitely will be back again soon  
R0063,Always enjoy visiting here  lovely staff  excellent food and service  Food hall downstairs added bonus to pick up treats to take home 
R0063,Amazing food and great service  The vegan menu was one of the best Ive ever seen 
R0063,Amazing seabream main course   crispy skin and perfectly cooked fish  The broccoli soup to start was also delicious 
R0063,amazing  we lived rvery bit of our nye dinner  highly recommended 
R0063,As always this is one of the best restaurants in Dublin 
R0063,Attended this place for a birthday celebration   Was underwhelmed by the decor of the restaurant   Very dated considering its such a well known restaurant  the tables are way too close together and our table itself was unstable and rocking    Its also too dark   I understand they are trying to set an ambience but I couldnt see my food even   the food is nice but not good enough to return for   Our biggest issue was the staff   They were constantly coming over to us    We felt on edge constantly   Too many servers serving the same table   I dont think they realised how many times a server had already been over to us   Experience was a disappointed but the food was ok
R0063,"They also ran out of beef fillet and the proposed ribeye was the smallest  I ever been served  Bearnaise was way too sour 
Stay away it is my advice  "
R0063,"Bad experience  
Stay away it is my advice  "
R0063,"Beautiful evening with attentive and professional staff  

Thanks for the experience"
R0063,Beautiful food  lovely staff and great atmosphere 
R0063,Beautiful setting and great menu  Excellent value pre theatre 
R0063,Been there several times  Food  ambience   friendly staff and value for money   always excellent 
R0063,Birthday food execellent service great
R0063,Very disappointing    Noise level was very high  struggled to hear each other talking  acoustics very poor with tables too close together  None of our group will not be returning and will certainly not recommend it to anyone else 
R0063,Booked for 8pm Saturday; Very disappointing    Noise level was very high  struggled to hear each other talking  acoustics very poor with tables too close together   Waited one hour for meal to be served   Limited menu read as high end cuisine but what was delivered was very ordinary   Only one vegetarian option and the portion size was very small   Price was not matched by quality and was in general way over priced   Quality napkins does not make up for ambience and service  There are many good restaurants in Dublin that can justify these prices    None of our group will not be returning and will certainly not recommend it to anyone else 
R0063,Came here for my Dads 70th  Everything was perfect 
R0063,"Cheapest hse wine  Euro 28 
Our party of 4 had to squish to one half of our round table so that we could hear each other  Acoustics need attention as too many hard surfaces meant chatter made for noisy din "
R0063,Delicious food and drinks  Vegan option really tasty  The service is friendly and efficient  Theres a lovely atmosphere and its spacious and bright 
R0063,"Dined here with my wife recently
Food and choice terrible
Never again"
R0063,Dinner and cocktails were delicious and the staff were very friendly and helpful
R0063,Disappointed on this visit   Poor  disinterested service  Hostess didnt look up for several minutes when we arrived despite being quiet   only 2 others in the restaurant at the time   Wold rate the food as okay this time 
R0063,"Disappointing overall experience  When we walked in there were three tables occupied so we asked for a booth and were told they were for groups of 4  There were a few pairs already seated in the booths so that didnt apply to them  Those booths remained open the entire time we dined 

The chicken salad was tasty and took less than ten minutes  However  the rest of the food took over 30 minutes to come  When the pizza arrived  it was soggy in the middle  No one came to check on us so we flagged them down 10 minutes later for water refill and to ask for assistance with the pizza  My husbsnds carbonara was pretty good  laden with bacon  not much sauce 

 Overall  disappointing and I realize were not in Italy but the service and food was not great for the price and type of dining experience offered "
R0063,Especially impressed with the vegan options  and the delicious kinder bueno dessert 
R0063,Everything was lovely until my girlfriend got violently ill a few hours after the meal  Monkfish is best avoided as a result stick with the steak
R0063,Excellent food  and  service
R0063,Excellent food and service in one of the most beautiful dining rooms in Dublin 
R0063,Excellent food  staff and atmosphere  Was our first but definitely not last time there 
R0063,Excellent location and dining experience  Good wine list  Very good value early bird menu available
R0063,Excellent location  scrumptious food  exceedingly friendly staff and of course excellent value for the early bird menu   We stayed until 11:00 pm  
R0063,Excellent service and amazing food  would highly recommend
R0063,Excellent service and choice of menu  Staff very friendly and helpful  Food presentation excellent 
R0063,Excellent service and great food  would definitely recommend this restaurant
R0063,Excellent staff  catered really well for food allergies  Excellent customer service
R0063,Excellent  We had a large group booking and start to finish we were looked after 
R0063,"The food had nothing exciting and desserts were disappointing  
We had high expectations for a restaurant with such a reputation and good reviews  Unfortunately we had a bad experience and wouldnt recommend it "
R0063,"Extremely disappointing experience  As soon as we sat down  we were asked to choose as quickly as possible  in an extremely rude manner because they needed the table later on that evening  This represented a very bad start to the dinning experience  We didnt feel welcome and wanted to leave 
The service was appalling  drops of wine all over the table and the plates were taken away as soon as we had finished eating which emphasized the fact they were eager for us to leave 
 Unfortunately we had a bad experience and wouldnt recommend it "
R0063,Fab food  friendly staff  buggy friendly and great ambience  Thoroughly enjoyed it 
R0063,Fab meal and service   Kid friendly   Will return again
R0063,Fabulous food and lovely friendly staff we will be back
R0063,It is a restaurant we look forward to dining at when In Dublin  We are uncertain that we shall return  The food was to a good standard  though not as memorable as before  but the wait of 20 minutes between the end of the first course and the main course was wholly unacceptable  Clearly  the kitchen forgot us
R0063,This place phoned me shortly after the reminder email arrived    the staff member didnt seem to know about the remainder email and was quite uppity about it   Early bird menu very limited  hamburger   very high and therefore even more overcooked than necessary  desserts unappealing  Not rushing back 
R0063,Fantastic  experience  from start to finish    Highly recommended 
R0063,Fantastic food   great wine list  Lovely ambience; recommended
R0063,Far  too noisy   Zero ambience  Staff unfriendly  Certainly not value for money   Food not good and certainly not to the standard of the prices being charged  
R0063,Fillet was overcooked and dry  Chips tasted like frozen ones
R0063,First off  let me say that I have only been here for two private parties and can only base my review on that  I have not experienced the normal food or atmosphere  so it could be different than for a private booking  
R0063,Food and service overall was very good but their coffee was awful  
R0063,Food and service was amazing   Sarahs recommendations were spot on   Delicious food in a GREAT environment    One of the best meals ever
R0063,Food excellent  waiter really good  knew his food and wine  and was very patient  Totally recommend this place for its consistency 
R0063,"Food is not that special  The service was good  When we received the check  there was writen with ballpoint; ""12 5 percent service charge""  Maybe this wass done because we come from another country  Amsterdam  The manager came and told us this is their policy      We told them this is illegal action and requested for a new check  We got the check and added a poor tip to the check  This was a RUDE and STUPID action from them  If they didnt do that the tip was higher than the 12 5 percent      "
R0063,Food really good  as always  and  great staff  Always love coming here 
R0063,Food was delicious  the staff extremely polite and we spent a Great night  I Will go back and recommend it to My friends as well   
R0063,Food was delicious  Staff were friendly and helpful  It was very busy 
R0063,Food was fabulous  and  staff very attentive  really enjoyed our lunch and will definitely be returning
R0063,Food was great and reasonably priced staff excellent cocktails great
R0063,Food was just all right and too expensive for what you got  Service was abrupt and rushef
R0063,"Food was lovely  service very slow
The noise level was dreadful could not enjoy chatting with each other"
R0063,"Food was nice  wine over priced  Thought I would have got a chance at trying some nice craft beer but they dont sell any  Strange for that side of town 
Booking was for 3 30pm  come 4 30pm and felt like I was to leave so they could turn the table around for the start of the evening booking "
R0063,Food was nice but for a Sunday lunch it was very expensive
R0063,"For such a lovely food store  the restaurant food was not good in terms of quality 
Most disappointing in that the meals seemed to have come from the freezer  were dry and with little taste  This was a shame as it was a special birthday dinner "
R0063,Good feedback on the food  price and early bird options  Not great feedback on the burgers from a few people so would remove from the menu or improve 
R0063,Good food 
R0063,Good food and nice space     but very noisy and the staff were too keen to keep pouring all the wine
R0063,Good food and service with nice ambiance  would definitely recommend and return
R0063,"Good food  but very slow service  we waited for ages between each course which was frustrating on a sunny day  The waiting staff seemed to have no idea that this is not normal  ""slow food"" or not "
R0063,Nothing special
R0063,Great brasserie experience with buzz  Excellent food and wine servedd very professionally  Enjoyed so much I went two nights in a row 
R0063,Great buzz in the place on a Saturday afternoon  Good menu    lots of choice  Service was friendly  and  efficient  Nice atmosphere with good food  Highly recommend it
R0063,Great food and excellent service  Very relaxed atmosphere and a great place for lunch in town yummy   
R0063,Great food  good variety  vegetarial/vegan options  Good choice of drinks  Staff very welcoming and accommodating  great service  good location   A Hidden Gem  Would highly recommend 
R0063,Great food  wine and service   Very pleasant surroundings 
R0063,Great night  great service and food  
R0063,Great place for Lunch  food and service excellent 
R0063,Great place  excellent food and wine list  Top service too  Highly recommended
R0063,Great restaurant  excellent service and atmosphere 
R0063,Great restaurant  loved the atmosphere  fab food and drinks menu  Excellent service  Id highly recommend this restaurant from any occasion
R0063,Great service and ambience  Plenty of choice for dining drinking and celebrating 
R0063,"Great Service and food  
Vegan menu available"
R0063,Great service and great food never fails  Great atmosphere
R0063,Great service and lovely food  Nice atmosphere  Would recommend a visit
R0063,great service  excellent food  Valentines day with the wife 
R0063,Great tasty food with a number of vegetarian options  Really enjoyed the meal and the great service was a bonus 
R0063,Food was very good but the service was very very  slow after the main course 
R0063,Had a great evening  great service and food  will be back again 
R0063,Had a lovely vegetarian meal here and was taken care of by Stephen and the excellent staff  Would definitely go back 
R0063,"Had friends from Australia   Starters were fine   Two of group had the steak which was decidedly ""chewy""   The noise level was too high   Had been there before for Sunday lunch and would not be racing back   Complained about the steak and got two free coffees   Had to ask a couple of times for our second bottle of sancerre   Disappointed with the experience overall especially with our foreign visitors present and not wishing to make a fuss "
R0063,Had pre theatre dinner excellent service but wine by the glass not marked on menu   is this even legal   almost 8 00    Had vegetarian roast was tasteless reminiscent of 1980s veggie food  Wont be back
R0063,"Hi  I was out with my wife for our anniversary dinner  I had been few weeks ago with America guests at a work event and the food was amazing  My colleague had been there previously and advised us to go and it was excellent  I do not usually complain about food but it wasnt good on Saturday night  I ordered the burger and my wife  the steak  I think both may have been under a lamp or something for a while as it took a while for them to come out and they were very very dry  

We informed the staff and they were very helpful  They gave us two free desserts so it was very well handled  

These things happen  it wasnt the end of the world and it was handled well by the staff  Just FYI   when it is busy it is important that the food isnt sitting whilst others are served  "
R0063,I appreciate it is the Christmas party season but perhaps guests can be pre warned before booking as my rare night out with my wife  without the kids  was pretty much spoiled due to large parties   
R0063,I booked for a group of ten for a Friday night as I had checked and noted there was a group menu available for  Euro 29 95  However when I asked for the group menu the price was  Euro 40 00  So an automatic increase of  Euro 100 for the group  No explanation was provided   The wine list was also overpriced  The waitress could not suggest a house wine and the recommendation was not a quality wine nor was it value at  Euro 32 00 a bottle   Seems to me  that RIP OFF Ireland is back 
R0063,I brought my friend here for her birthday  She and I loved the food and enjoyed a nice glass of wine
R0063,"I did find a small pebble in my fries  I found it when I bit on it  Luckily no damage was done 

But the focus of my review is on the response from the staff 

The waiter first asked for the stone  took it down to the kitchen  Promptly the manager came up to me  asked me if I was ok and I had hurt myself  She apologised and explained how everything is prepared by hand and she had no idea how this could have happened  She immediately cancelled the bill and gave me a voucher 

It is rare that a restaurant takes swift and polite action on what could have been a serious injury  Im glad I didnt injure my teeth but I was really impressed with how the situation was dealt with 

Prep chefs need to keep a closer eye even if it was a freak incident  But Kudos to the manager for her professional handling of the situation"
R0063,I dont know if it was poor because close to Xmas  and  everywhere busy but I wouldnt rush back
R0063,I enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant  however the service did not meet expectations  
R0063,We had two incidents were the waiters dropped things onto us and we barely got an apology  We expected better standard of service as we were paying a higher price for our food than other restaurants  
R0063,I expected it to be good but it was really good  Portions were big  food and drinks price are very reasonable will definitely return 
R0063,I felt the service was efficient but lack interaction with customer  The atmosphere was a bit cold  Food good
R0063,I have been to their restaurant several time and  as always  great food and good value 
R0063,I heard a lot of hype before going to this restaurant  While the restaurant itself has a beautiful market on the main floor and the food is decent  the service takes forever  A 2 5 hour dinner with a toddler and infant  Our waiter went missing several times as well which became frustrating 
R0063,"I love this place and had been looking forward to trying the restaurant for some time  so when my mother was visiting from Australia I thought it would be a treat to book in for lunch 
Unfortunately the restaurant fell well short of my expectations   
We ordered the fish platter to share as a starter  and the waiter was very unobliging when we asked for gluten free bread   After 10 minutes of waiting with the platter in front of us we proceeded without it  and when we were just about finished  the waiter brought out 3 x pieces of very ordinary looking white toast which we didnt eat   The salmon on the platter was very nice  but the prawn cocktail was drowning in a tasteless mayonnaise   For mains   my son ordered a burger which was lovely   My mum had a goats cheese tart which had  nice filling but too much pastry which she left on her plate   I ordered the large melon and squash salad  expecting it to be enough to be eaten as a light meal  but it was no larger than the garnish on my sons burger and while it tasted lovely  it was definitely not worth the 12 95 euro that I paid for it 
All in all it was a terrible experience and I wish wed eaten at the cafe downstairs instead  saved some money  and enjoyed the ambiance "
R0063,"I ordered from here online a couple of times and the food was hit and miss 
Not recommended"
R0063,"I thought I would give this place a try because they seem to be consistently packed at lunch with queues of people out the door; as I have now learned  this is not always a good indicator  Its a cozy space  with a buffet style counter to order at  stools inside and benches out front if you want to get some air 

I ordered the veg massaman curry which  although it packed in a good flavour with essentials like bay leaves and coconut clearly present  was a bit sickening  But what really let it down were the items formerly known as Vegetables  cooked to within an inch of their life  and possibly left on the heat for hours   pieces of cauliflower  onion and broccoli all had the same soft texture  cut though only by the occasional bland peanut and a solitary piece of fried tofu  Sad 

Perhaps I made the wrong menu choice  but I dont think Ill be back to gamble with my  Euro 5 50 again "
R0063,"I want to preface by saying we had a wonderful meal  but that our experience was overshadowed by something that occurred at the end of it 

My husband and had had made reservations in advance for 6pm  When we go there  the restaurant was pretty quiet aside from a few other tables  and only was moderately busy around 7pm when we were finishing up  We were given the check and paid  and were sitting enjoying the last glasses of wine from the bottle we ordered when we were suddenly approached by someone who was not our waitress and were told  ""Im sorry  but we need this table  youre going to have to move  You can sit at the bar if youd like "" 

We looked around in disbelief  as there were many empty tables around us  Not to mention  there were 2 women at a table 2 down from us who were there before we arrived  and were still sitting and chatting with empty wine glasses in front of them  undisturbed 

I kid you not when I say I had a full glass of wine left  My husband and I were so shocked  that we got up and left  I cannot believe a high end restaurant would ever treat a paying guest in that manner  We werent even asked nicely or offered a free drink at the bar for our trouble  Never is it appropriate to kick someone out of their table  especially when they made reservations in advanced  there were other empty tables around them and we had just spent 100 euro at your establishment  My entire glass of wine went to waste 

Needless to say we left with a very sour taste in our mouths  and with no plans of returning or recommending it to anyone  Its a shame  really because had that not occurred  we would have had nothing but positive things to say "
R0063,I was extremely disappointed with the food in here
R0063,The choice of desserts was very poor and those of us who ordered the vegan choc dessert were very disappointed  An over priced and frankly very poor meal  A huge disappointment on my sisters 50th birthday 
R0063,I went to your restaurant for my daughters  graduation about two years ago and was really impressed with the food and the service and promised myself a return visit    I organised to take my aunt and cousin to your restaurant for a meal when they visited Ireland from Australia in September    I was not at all impressed with the quality of the food   My husband was unwell after the meal which was very inconvenient as he was  taking a flight the following day   The standard of the restaurant has slipped since my last visit to my disappointment as I really wanted to impress my visitors   I was pleased with the service  we had a very attentive and well trained waiter   Disappointed and dont think I will be returning 
R0063,"We were a party of three  my husband  aunt and myself   My husband and I were actually horrified by the size of the portions and especially the main course for the vegan main dish and what was served  We did not say anything as our Aunt was  treating us to celebrate our first pregnancy  and we did not want to upset her 

We were also  there in the summer  and although the portions could have been better we decided to go back again and  check out the autumn/winter menu  The Staff were lovely and the ambience good  but unfortunately we were so taken aback by the food that I cant see why I would go back again "
R0063,I wouldnt recommend it at all and have actually being honest when people have asked me about my experience 
R0063,Ive eaten here a number of times  and its always excellent   The restaurant is lovely; the menu is great; the service is superb   I highly recommend it 
R0063,Ive eaten here a few times over the years   outstanding every time  Food and service are both top notch 
R0063,It is always an enjoyable dining experience 
R0063,It was a holiday lunch with my parents  Went great
R0063,It was so dark I couldnt read the menu or see my food  When u couldnt read the bill the waiter used the screen of the card machine for illumination  I wont be back for dinner in wintertime 
R0063,It was the Friday of Valentines weekend and I would say we had finished our food within an hour of ordering  We had literally only ordered and our starters were out  Food tasted good no complaints but felts we were being rushed through our meal even though we had the table until 8 30pm  Understand it was going to be a busy night but a little less haste would have been good
R0063,It was very loud; and I found it overpriced esp  steaks
R0063,Just gorgeous  A real treat  Will be back again  Lovely atmosphere
R0063,Last night in Dublin   Saved the best for last   Loved the food 
R0063,Lovely dining room   round table perfect for a chatty lunch  Food delicious and staff friendly and attentive  Would definitely recommend 
R0063,Lovely evening celebration  Enjoyed
R0063,Lovely experience  Good food and prompt service  Happy to come back 
R0063,Lovely food  Very attentive staff  Perfect for a catch up 
R0063,Lovely meal for 18th birthday  Coeliac and vegan friendly 
R0063,Lovely place  very good atmosphere and friendly staff 
R0063,Lovely restaurant   outstanding food and service  Would recommend
R0063,Lovely staff  wonderful salad  and quiet place to enjoy a beer and food  The lighting is a bit dim  they were out of the two soups Id wanted early in the day  but everything else was tip top 
R0063,Lovely venue   airy and spacious  Great service  Highly recommend
R0063,My husband and i wanted to try somewhere different as we spend a weekend in Dublin every couple of months or so  We both had Ribeye and both requested medium rare  It was medium to well done and not pink in the middle  It had no flavour and seemed to carry a lot of water  not juice  We were asked for our feedback and we were honest  The maitre d didnt charge us which was not expected however appreciated  Very disappointing to get such a poor steak especially in a place that prides itself in food and the sourcing of high quality food  Maybe the steak would have been nicer if it was not overcooked   not sure  It was very watery and the texture dry  The starters were very good  scallops and prosciutto 
R0063,My main course of the hake was very salty  It was difficult to eat 
R0063,My wife and I came to dinner to celebrate my MA graduation  I came away feeling quite let down  My food  tian of marinaded salmon  sea bass  and  panna cotta  was pretty tasteless  One of the accompanying vegetables to the fish was over salted  it left a salty impression on my tongue for minutes after I had finished the food  Our wine was in an ice bucket out of our reach  and was poured too quickly   meaning the bottle had been emptied before our main course arrived  leaving us with only what was in our glasses  Despite a long pause between starter and main we had the impression of being rushed  I felt I could have prepared a better meal myself and was very disappointed   Despite having a pretty light meal I had indigestion through the night  We will not be coming back 
R0063,not good value for the money   Tables were far too close together   not comfortable with how the diners beside me were in my personal space 
R0063,"Organised a dinner for ten people as a get together  We arrived promptly in time for our reservation and placed orders  The food was by and large only mediocre for all  I can understand one or two meals maybe  but not for everyone  Maybe it was the size of the group and trying to get everything ready for ten  but I would expect more of a restaurant such as this  
Im disappointed as Id been there many times before and I always enjoyed it "
R0063,we were served 2 people  one was very friendly while the other was non communicative  it was expensive for what you got  a glass of Chardonnay was  Euro 9 50  we declined  
R0063,Our food was ok  but thats all  nothing spectacular  the service wasnt great theres a big difference between the friendliness of the waiting staff 
R0063,Our group of 11  including two vegans  thoroughly enjoyed our meals  The staff was friendly and the food was excellent 
R0063,Outstanding menu and service  with excellent vegan options for food and wine 
R0063,Overall terrible experience  Never would recommend this place to my worst enemy
R0063,Upon entering  I was ignored  When it was apparent that I was indeed going to order something  the surly lady behind the counter asked what I would like  Eager to try a Shepherds Pie during my time in Ireland  I went with the pie  I am a sucker for wakame and cashew creme  so it sounded great   Euro 15  and comes with two choices of salad  which are displayed in bowls in a glass case  I went with the beetroot  and a colorful zucchini/rice noodle  Both of the salads were edible  but in no way enjoyable  They were cold  slimy  and devoid of flavor of any kind  The Pie was a salty mush of tofu  potato  and salt  No complexity of texture or flavor 
R0063,Quality food and excellent service  Best cocktail Ive had in Dublin 
R0063,Quite expensive for the amount of food on the plate  I was hungry when i left  No a huge amount of options available on the menu 
R0063,Really busy  great atmosphere  gorgeous food and excellent service 
R0063,Really looking forward to dinner as had enjoyed wonderful meal there last year  Such a disappointment  Two of the party ordered lamb and one chicken  Lamb stringy and tasteless and chicken dry and over cooked  All food had been liberally dosed in salt and vegetables and sauce were inedible  No more special occasion meals  or any meals  for me at what had previously been such a great restaurant 
R0063,Requested well done burgers and were advised that all burgers are served well done as standard unless requested otherwise  Burgers were served with pink centers 
R0063,Service was excellent but could not make up for the awful food 
R0063,Service was extremely slow   Food was only lukewarm   Not a good experience at all 
R0063,Service was good  Had some overly charred  garlic on fish otherwise rest of the meal was good 
R0063,Service was mediocre and slow  Food was fine but not worth the money 
R0063,Service was very poor  Our food was forgotten and nobody came to check on us for a very long time  unapologetically  as the servers were too busy chatting amongst themselves  The restaurant was not overly busy for this to reasonably occur 
R0063,Service was very slow despite being the first ones there for lunch service  also the starter of soup was completely tasteless and watery and not to the standard of the other dishes we consumed that day 
R0063,Shitebags  We always order from here honest to god twice a week if not more and the service we recieved tonight was disgusting  Stupid basterds sent the wrong order and when we rang them to tell them your man was a cheeky cunt giving it loads also called me a bitch acting the gangster  A K A / G UNOT instead of admitting he got the order wrong and saying sorry as we are loyal customors the cunt just kept getting lippy  Never again after all me years would i order from this kip  Anyway the delivery girl was lovely and came back up 10 mins later with are money back and they got there food back perfect  as the guy on the phone threathen everything sent back better be in the way it was sent  honest to god you have an awful fizzbag working for ur company and he is lucky the phone call was over the phone or he would of woke up with no teeth in his head   Thank you guys for your service over the last 2 years   All the best
R0063,Some of the best food in Dublin  beautiful ambiance
R0063,Staff very attentive  lovely room and ambiance   Food fair  two of our party had prawns to start which were stone cold   The Cesear Salad was mostly just lettuce  the bread which accompanied it was very tasty though   Steaks were fine but the Lamb lacked flavour and some of it was like braised mutton   Deserts were fine but the cheeseboard lacked flavour and was a little dry/stale   We were a party of ten but dont think we will be returning again soon 
R0063,"Starter and dessert very good The main of beef burger   disappointing Chicken risotto and salmon good 
Service v good but was efficient rather than friendly 
Really liked the setting and ambience 
Would go again    but could not recommend set menu"
R0063,Starter was good if not a little small   Main course took a while to come    The  Lamb Shank was two small pieces of lamb and not a shank on a puree that tasted of nothing      It was four mouthfuls of food    Those that had the lamb were guests and therefore did not complain when asked 5 seconds after the meal was delivered was everything ok   As I suggested the restaurant I asked for a taste to discover it was awful I mentioned it to waiter twice and nothing   We mentioned it again as we were asked did we enjoy our meal before the bill and still no reaction        so wont be going there again in a hurry 
R0063,Still one of the best in Ireland  hands down 
R0063,Such a great restaurant  food is always good and the service us outstanding 
R0063,The beef was bad  It was burnt  3 month before I had a very good experience  but this time I was unfortunately dissatisfied 
R0063,"The dining experience was not very good  When we arrived at 7 15pm we where  left for at least 15 to 20 mins before anyone approach us  At no  stage were we offered a drink or greeted by  our server  When finally approached our server took our order for our drink  starter and main course  by at  least 8 pm we had everything  While I appreciate you allow a 2 hour sitting  as specified on the website the speed at which we received our food was ridiculous  In regards to the food the starters in this case 2 salads  where fine  The main course was very generous but bland at best  On paying the bill I was asked if everything was ok and I did mention that it was too rushed  I was told I should have said something at the time  but in reality what can be done if you feel the food arrives too quickly  Our bill was close to  Euro 90 which for 2 salads  2 mains  rabbit and chicken  a glass of wine and a beer is pretty pricy 
I feel if you want to turn tables over as quickly as you can you must still be able to offer  great service and value  unfortunately in case we received neither "
R0063,"The first time I went there  the server pushed their soft shell crab roll  one of the three specialty rolls available  which is pretty disappointing itself  your choices in the sushi department here are pretty much confined to small basic rolls and chef selection nigiri   It is topped with masago  primarily I suspect to hide the fact that the roll is 75 percent rice  20 percent tempura  and 5 percent anything that might have ever been in a crab  It is a 7 50 / 14 99 plate of rice and tempura batter  Considering this is the only specialty roll they offer outside of ""vegetarian"" and the wonderfully vague ""seafood"" rolls  not to mention how much the waiter was touting this roll is pretty shameful 
"
R0063,The food and service were excellent  We really loved it and will definitely be back 
R0063,"The restaurant is lovely  Good ambiance  We had the pre theatre menu  Very limited
But I understand that  Not cheap as a pre theatre 
I had the burger and it was burned black 
I had  what were supposed to be French Fries 
They were not French Fries  They were over cooked chip sticks  

I am afraid my meal was very disappointing  and it was a pity as I am sure the restaurant could do better 

I would not see any reason for me or anybody I know to visit this establishment again 
Bad deal "
R0063,The restaurant is spacious with beautiful decor  Seating is comfortable  and uncrowded  I ate from the vegan menu  which is a wonderful option to have  The wine and cocktail lists are extensive  Food quality is superb as is presentation  Staff were wonderfully attentive but not obtrusive  Would highly recommend and will more than likely be returning soon 
R0063,The staff were lovely and service was fine  However with the food being so mediocre and overly priced  its not somewhere Id be rushing back to 
R0063,"This establishment has been in decline since it changed hands a year or two ago  

They are understaffed and it makes for a chaotic dining experience  This is in sharp contrast  which ran like clockwork and with the highest standards of service  

We go there frequently because its just down the street from our house and all our friends go there to meet  but if it were even 250m further away  I would not be going back  

Hopefully they will read this and work on fixing the service issues  

The only thing Ive eaten there since it changed hands was the burger  and they are way better at Bunsen "
R0063,This is a restaurant we look forward to dining at when In Dublin  We are uncertain that we shall return  The food was to a good standard  though not as memorable as before  but the wait of 20 minutes between the end of the first course and the main course was wholly unacceptable  Clearly  the kitchen forgot us
R0063,"The decor of the restaurant is so old  The room feels so empty  including the tiny and sad Christmas decorations they put on couches  The place is so sad I wanted to leave the minute I arrived    

The menu was so basic also   if I go out and eat at a restaurant I do not want to pay  Euro 25 for chicken  

This restaurant needs a major revamp to keep it up with the competition  no wonder it was pretty much empty  

The market at street level is a total different story  they are an institution in Dublin and the only place where you can get decent food "
R0063,This is the best restaurant we went to in Dublin   It was recommended by a local   First class in every way 
R0063,"The appetizer citrus fish was delicious   However  the ribeye steaks had no flavor at all   

The waitstaff barely stopped by to check in with us throughout the meal   At the end  one we had already finished dinner  a waitress did ask how everything was and offered to get something else  but that was already 20+ minutes after the food had arrived   Way too late to change 

I would not recommend this restaurant "
R0063,"This restaurant was a big disappointment   It is billed as a place with wonderful food and even a wine cellar downstairs  

The service was weak  even prior to multiple tables each with 15 people at them  

Neither the waiter nor the head of the bar had a reasonable knowledge of the wine  which was quite surprising given the wine cellar downstairs "
R0063,This was a good dining experience  Good food  Wine selected downstairs  We all went away satisfied 
R0063,This was one of the most appalling restaurant experiences I have ever been to  The restaurant was so loud  we couldnt hear each other speak  There were too many people in a room with low ceilings  The food was poor at best  I would never go back here 
R0063,Time and time again  present magnificent food  roll on next trip to Dublin 
R0063,too much noise  we almost had to scream   in a table of just 3 people and the restaurant was not full  cant imagine the noise when full 
R0063,Unfortunately while the staff were lovely  we experienced slow slow service  Also brought a bday cake which we werent allowed consume on the premises  Very disappointing  Im sorry to say we wont be returning 
R0063,Very disappointed with my meal  I was expecting a lot more   but the food was very standard   something I could have made at home  The celeriac soup was completely tasteless  my Caesar salad was just fine  We both had fish for main course  It was tasty but nothing outstanding  White wine was very average and not chilled enough  The seating area is very squashed  it feels like youre on top of the people beside you and the waiters  
R0063,Overall  would not recommend  Too expensive and doesnt deliver on what you would expect 
R0063,Very disappointing experience on Friday evening at the restaurant  My food was served cold and with a sauce I didnt order  Plates of all guests were cold  Wine very expensive  Definitely wont be coming back and could not recommend  Sad to say   
R0063,Very enjoyable meal  food was delicious  service  was great  a nice busy buzzing restaurant 
R0063,Very enjoyable  good food  very attentive staff  good atmosphere
R0063,Very loud and busy  waiter brought wrong order to the table 3 times  which was comical  Service staff very efficient but unfriendly  just going through the motions  Wine bucket kept in middle of the floor miles away to accommodate other surrounding tables    apparently there was a shortage of buckets  Food was lovely  ordered from the set menu  and good value  but wines steep for what they were   I wouldnt be in any hurry to return  But I will say girl at reception desk with blonde hair who showed us to your table  was very nice and accommodating 
R0063,Very loud and busy  Service staff very inefficient and unfriendly  just not what you expect  I wouldnt return  
R0063,Very much a French bistro experience  Kitchen very accommodating for gluten and dairy free dining  Food was farm to table and well prepared and presented  Would highly recommend 
R0063,Overall I felt the restaurant had too much on and everything seemed very stressed  I love the shop but would not go to the restaurant again 
R0063,Very noisy with loud fast beat music   not conducive to relaxing and digesting food  I opted for the vegetarian option because it seemed the most interesting but in fact it was very boring and bland  The waitress overfilled the red wine glasses and kept topping them up even though we had no food as yet 
R0063,Very quick with bringing each course and a mix up on the bill let it down
R0063,Visit to Dublin from Chicago had good food at this place
R0063,"Visited several times and always a great meal  good staff and a great atmosphere 
Highly recommended"
R0063,"Waited a long time to get a drink  then waiting a long time to be served or even have our order taken  Both of us wanted the rabbit but were informed after ordering that it was no longer on the menu  finally settled for steak which was pretty good in fairness 
But the sitting and waiting for so long with no engagement from staff meant I wont be rushing back "
R0063,Warm friendly restaurant  great service  delicious food
R0063,"Was a wonderful treat from my children as a late Mothers Day treat
Loved it"
R0063,"Way too noisy  I could not hear my friend  Very slow service  We waited for an hour
Good food though  
Would go back but for lunch only"
R0063,We appreciated the unobtrusive service and tasty food 
R0063,"We came for a Friday night dinner and had delicious
meal and wonderful  caring service  The food was delicious  creative and well prepared "
R0063,I think the place has potential but for the cost of food  the Service certainly doesnt measure up 
R0063," While the food was good  it was not a step above the rest  On par with what you would expect a place like this to have  

First let me say we are tourists in Dublin   We are pretty mindful of local custom and culture and try to stay out of peoples way  From the moment we walked in it felt like they didnt want us there  Just two of us no big deal  We were hurried throughout the meal the waiter was annoyed we didnt seem to know what we wanted to drink after just sitting down  Also  with the food order  he seemed annoyed that we took a little longer  The final push was when the bill was paid and I was waiting for my husband at the table  He had signed the card and different waiter  female  rushed over to me  while I was still looking at the bill  and said can I have the receipt now  

At first I thought it might be a cultural difference  but no other place we ate treated us this way  We spent about  Euro 150 there  It wasnt cheap and we left with just a disheartening feeling  What made up for it was all the other amazing  locals we met and places we went  I would recommend finding another place "
R0063,We enjoyed the food but the acoustics were    awful  We appreciate that it was a busy Saturday night but we could not hear each other to have a conversation   We did not stay for drinks after dinner as it was just too loud  It is definitely not a venue for a relaxing meal 
R0063,We had a problem with service but to be fair the manager dealt promptly with us
R0063,"We had a very nice evening meal nice wine great service 
Thank you"
R0063,We had a wonderful meal   The service was great   5 Stars
R0063,We had the early bird    desserts were lovely   chicken main course was ok    Caesar salad was ok surrounding were really lovely 
R0063,We had to order 3 bottles of wine before we managed to pick one that they actually had in stock   Considering it was a small ish wine menu and the restaurant boasts a wine cellar this was a bit surprising   More frustrating though was the wait to order the wine in the first place then even though they returned to say they didnt have it and we needed to pick another one it was impossible to get someones attention to order the 2nd one and then again on the 3rd   The place wasnt full so there should have been a better level of service   Staff were relatively unfriendly as well as being difficult to get their attention if we needed something   Steak was overcooked and nothing special 
R0063,We had to order 3 bottles of wine before we managed to pick one that they actually had in stock   Considering it was a small ish wine menu and the restaurant boasts a wine cellar this was a bit surprising   More frustrating though was the wait to order the wine in the first place then even though they returned to say they didnt have it and we needed to pick another one it was impossible to get someones attention to order the 2nd one and then again on the 3rd   The place wasnt full so there should have been a better level of service   Staff were relatively unfriendly as well as being difficult to get their attention if we needed something   Steak was overcooked and nothing special 
R0063,We just did not like the food   Go to a pub and you will get better food at way better price 
R0063,We ordered off the set menu which i felt was fantastic value and the food was top class   Will definitely be back
R0063,We went for a Sunday Lunch last Sunday and were reallly looking forward to it  as we had been there before and thoroughly enjoyed it Sadly on this occasion it was not so enjoyable  The waiter who served us  while nice wasnt great We both had starters pulled pork bruschetta for me and Caesar salad for my husband The pork was nice but the Caesar salad had almost no dressing on it so was very dry We both ordered burgers and both of us asked for very well done but both burgers were very pink and neither of us could eat all of it In fact I had ordered mine to be very well done and to have no cheese or bacon Even while the waiter was taking the order it was fairly obvious that his mind was not on the task as we had to repeat ourselves a couple of times My burger arrived with no bun and a side plate of tomatoes   Another waiter delivered the food to the table and i asked him could i have a burger bun he was very pleasant and came back with my plate very quickly As i said before  both burgers were VERY undercooked  I then had a Kinder Bueno dessert  which was ok  but had a strong taste of butterscotch which i wasnt expecting  My husband had lost interest in ordering dessert because of the undercooked burger and the tasteless Caesar salad  and said he would make something at home Overall a very disappointing lunch So probably wouldnt reccomended 
R0063,We went last week with high hopes after recommendation  We were let down by the food and below average service 
R0063,We were celebrating my parents 50th wedding anniversay and chose because it is a great place to eat to mark an occasion but still casual enough to relax and enjoy  The food was excellent  particularly the seafood and the steak  The service was great  our waiter was fantastic  I would highly recommend
R0063,We were excited to have a reservation for our first evening in Dublin  It was Mothers Day and very busy  Server was clearly rushing us   we had to request predinner drinks and felt pushed to order quickly  The order was not correct when served although that was fixed quickly  The food was okay   nothing special  They got us in and out in an hour   not our goal 
R0063,We were shown to our table promptly however our orders were not taken for 59 min  One of our party had Prime Rib which was very � chewy � Most disappointing   as a visitor from Australia I had expected the quality of Irish Beef to be far better 
R0063,We were very disappointed having read such good reviews   The noise was truly deafening  and while our starters were very good  the entrees not so much   Roast chicken was very dry   Service was very slow  was 45 minutes or so between courses  
R0063,We didnt stay for dessert  just had to get out of there because of the noise
R0063,We werent told that the restaurant needed the table back until we ordered dessert  And the waiter was quite rude about it 
R0063,Overall value for money was bad and I would not recommend the tasting menu in this restaurant  I can t comment on any other menus as I have not returned to eat there  The quality of food supplied in the shop is very good; how this did not transfer to the tasting menu is baffling  
R0063,"When booking for New Year s eve   we were not informed that it was a set tasting menu The menu itself was poor  the first two courses were ""write offs"" while the other three courses improved slightly  The waiter service was exceptional  and the waiters apologized to us when we raised our concerns and   disappointment with the menu  and offered additional glasses of prosecco ""to ease the pain""  "
R0063,Wonderful food  excellent service and beautiful setting  A lovely experience Id highly recommend 
R0063,"Worth the return visit 
Highlight of the day 
Food and service always v good "
R0063,Yeah     dont go  told me I had to go back into the rain just because I brought some other food and wanted to sit with my family  Made up some bullcrap  really in the rain  What asses
R0064, The food is good Overall experience is good and will visit again
R0064,Bar review  Bartender was extremely rude and unhelpful  All I did was ask for a beer and was given a huge dose of crap  �Paid 60 percent more for a pint  Oh and this was early in the evening before it was crowded  Skip  Plenty of good pubs in other neighborhoods 
R0064,Disaster of a mothers day meal  2 hour wait undercooked food felt sorry for the staff
R0064,"Drinks were wrong  food was cold  table was cleared when we were away from table  Waiter cleared 3 full plates and never asked what was wrong  

Wont be back"
R0064,Favourite place for lunch  Great sandwiches and salad  premium ingredients and inventive weekly specials  Yummy
R0064,Food is not to the standard of other restaurants Ive visited many times  Chips tasted like they were reheated  Wings were overdone and dry  I had to ask twice at the bar for our table to be cleared and if we could order drinks 
R0064,"Great food  I wanted to love it    Let down by poor service  20 minute wait for a coke   

Disappointing that smoking is allowed in the main terrace dining area 

Chicken wings were great but drowning in a bath of hot sauce "
R0064,I returned back the whole box and he just said other people not complaining  well  not all bothered to complaint and now I am reading the reviews on other websites  no wonder most reviews are very negative  
R0064,Id rather not say 
R0064,It took ages to call over the waiter for something  and a while to order 
R0064,Lovely lovely food  Best steak and Guinness pie Ive ever had and the poached peach salad with black pudding was out of this world 
R0064,The menu wasnt what was advertised on the app so both of our options were limited  The waitress was friendly and nice but the place was clearly understaffed  Also i ordered a burger and asked for parmesan fries  I was charged for my burger and fries and another 6 euro for parmesan fries   I left feeling a bit ripped off 
R0064,we had a lovely meal with my friends  Very friendly staff and great atmosphere  We tried a Lamb a d it was really nice  Id like go back there 
R0065,Brilliant food  great experience  will be back for sure
R0065,Excellent standard of food and the service from the staff was exceptional 
R0065,Great service  friendly staff  will go again
R0065,Lovely food  friendly staff  good value for money  Food well presented  Staff polite and efficient
R0065,Nice ambiance  attentive service  polite staff  excellent food  good beverage/wine list  My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it   Highly recommend 
R0065,Overall it was beautifull experience and lovely dinner    food was delicious and staff was amazing  especially your Croatian part of the team    
R0065,Service and food were all excellent  
R0065,"Staff are always very helpful 
Food is always amazing "
R0065,2 diners and both amazing with mains  Chicken supreme dish particularly yum    Service great
R0065,55 euro per head and each main course basically a meat/fish and two veg  Didnt want desert but as it was a set menu no choice but to pay 55 each for a starter and main  Staff disappeared around 11:30  Going there a long time on occasion  Very poor this time round
R0065,A beautiful restaurant; but  the building and decor were the highlights of what was otherwise an experience best described as �mediocre�   One entree overcooked  one entree undercooked  Food brought to table at different times for each of us  Waitress was overwhelmed with her workload   We would not return and can only hope we visited on an �off� night for the kitchen and waitress 
R0065,Perfect place for date night
R0065,If you like themed pubs/restaurants youll probably love this place

R0065,A great meal 
R0065,A great night  We would recommend this venue for a great meal 
R0065,A Lovely evening  Nice place and good food  We would love to go back 
R0065,"A real disappointment   I had read several review that this place is one of the ""best"" restaurants in Dublin   We were first lead to a loud  busy table by the bussing station and kitchen door   Gratefully  the hostess found a significantly better table where we could have a conversation   And there we sat    waiting to give our drink order  eventually trying to describe the drinks we wanted to our polite  but not quite English speaking server   The Rose Sangria was beautiful to look at and nasty to drink  Bitter and poor quality wine   The house red wine was a decent table wine   We ordered the Mozzarella and tomato appetizer   Sparse and tasteless   My husband said his steak was good   not great   My salmon was greasy and tasteless   We liked the ambiance and were looking forward to a special meal  but it was not worth the hype or the price "
R0065,A really fab restaurant  food was divine and the service was brilliant   Will most certainly return
R0065,"A very enjoyable dining experience in a very nice building 
Great menu
Food and service was exceptional 
We will definitely be returning"
R0065,"We visited for one day from London  We needed a receipt for our food in order to claim expenses  They refused to give us a receipt  we were very rudely ordered to leave when we requested one  We were then shouted at repeatedly  Eventually  the chef was called to issue us with refund 

The manager  is one of the rudest people I have ever met  Please avoid this place  "
R0065,A wonderful occasion served by lovely people and the food was top class  It was a lovely experience Thank you 
R0065,A wonderful restaurant with excellent food  service and atmosphere  Will definitely go back there if I go back to Dublin 
R0065,Absolutely amazing place to eat  Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Dublin
R0065,Absolutely fantastic restaurant for special occasions 
R0065,Absolutely loved it 
R0065,Absolutely loved this place  The food  service was amazing  Beautiful building inside and out 5star 10 out of 10
R0065,"Absolutely superb from start to finish    cannot wait to return 
Thank you"
R0065,"Absolutely the worst pizza place I have ever had the misfortune of stepping into  I entered the restaurant 10 minutes before closing and placed an order with two of my friends  The cashier proceeded to mock the way I ordered my pizza and my friend said ""no thank you  we will take our money back "" At which point he insulted my friend and began to shove us out the door  He began yelling at all of us and got physical with his customers  He shoved my female friend out the door and pushed her face  I left this facility insulted  hungry and disappointed in humanity  DO NOT GO HERE EVER "
R0065,Always delivers 
R0065,Amazing food and friendly staff made it a wonderful day for myself and my 2 friends   Well definitely be back
R0065,Amazing food and service loved the atmosphere and the cocktails steak was the nicest steak i have ever had
R0065,Amazing food and staff  we felt so taken care of from start to finish and they made our anniversary one to remember  I will be back as often as I can 
R0065,Amazing food in a great venue with a great atmosphere  well done folks 
R0065,Amazing food  well trained staff and good value for money 
R0065,Amazing for special occasions  outstanding service  Worth the higher price range and food was delicious 
R0065,Amazing friendly natural service from the bar area right through to dining  Michael in particular was an excellent waiter who made us feel so welcome 
R0065,amazing place  excellent environment  exquisite food
R0065,Amazing place  food is great  staff very friendly and helpful

R0065,"Ambiance  service as well as the menu was specially amazing 

A great moment to spend for great occasions"
R0065,An absolutely incredible experience for anyone who comes to Dublin 
R0065,Anniversary Dinner Date Night good experience
R0065,Another good meal had in this gem of a restaurant  Lovely relaxing environment  No fault with anything
R0065,Appalling  completely disorganized service  Expected so much more
R0065,Completely amazing service  
R0065,Arrived to a lovely door host  Bar completely empty when we arrived  had to wait quite a while to order drinks  Cocktail was horrible and very syrupy  Barman flat and ignored us  Upstairs we waited ages to place our order  The girl who was serving us was clearly new and very under trained  She was very sweet and did her best  Waited over 45mins for our food  we only had mains  Vegetables came out and then we had to wait again for the steak to arrive  Food was good  but certainly not worth the wait  When bill arrived it was incorrect and we had been overcharged  For what was a romantic birthday dinner we left very disappointed 
R0065,As always a great experience in this place they cannot do enough for you
R0065,As always this place provided a wonderful experience of atmosphere  fine food  friendly efficient service and good value
R0065,As good as it gets really  like a good meal with enough food to satisfy my appetite 
R0065,As usual we had an excellent meal with superb service
R0065,As you read this  keep in mind that I am not one to complain and especially in a European City as great as Dublin  pretty easy to please   However  despite an incredible �Room� that is this place  and food that was just  �OK�  but pretty good   the rest was underwhelming   This is a large room with many working people in it  none of whom looked happy and all of whom looked really stressed   The place was packed on the Saturday night we were there and staff seemed determined to get us in and out as quickly as possible   The waiter that took our order �insisted� that we order dessert when we ordered apps and entrees after which we NEVER spoke with him again   No �how is your meal� or �can I get you another glass of wine� here  unless you stick your leg out to trip someone   Others around us were similarly ignored   Dublin has some incredible restaurants with both incredible food and service so this is one that you should just drop by during the day; take a picture of the room  and eat in one of the other incredible places in Dublin �cause this isnt one of them   As I told the manager  Im prepared to accept the fact that our experience was the exception and not the Rule but the faces of the employees tells me otherwise 
R0065,"Awful service 
No ambience 
Food cold
So disappointing
Would never go back or recommend 
Ridiculous for the price of food and wine"

R0065,Bad service and very rude pleople attend these place
R0065,Very rude pleople attend these place Stay away
R0065,Bang Average food and service  Unseasoned Steak and poor service  bar staff downstairs were nice and cocktails where good only reason I gave a 2 star  Wont be back heavily overpiced for what we got  Much better value and quality else where in the city centre 
R0065,"Based on our experience I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone for any occasion  I have already submitted a detailed review on web and to the management of this place 
We had mediocre food   steak that was tasteless and all hot dishes were served on cold plates and were tepid 
My recommendation is that if you wish to spend that kind of money there is plenty of choice in this area "
R0065,"Basic overpriced food and menu  
"
R0065,"Basic overpriced food and menu  
Will not be going back "
R0065,Basically I thought it was a complete rip off     they either need to look at their prices or increase their portions

R0065,"Beautiful place  Staff very helpful and excellent service  Favourite restuarant in dublin  Food was fantastic and reasonably priced

R0065,Beautiful venue with lovely staff and great food  prices but perfect for something special
R0065,Been 5 times or more but sunday night it just wasnt up to scratch the food and service wasnt great like it has been other times sorry
R0065,Been a few times now and it never disappoints even if I do have to fly from Manchester to eat there
R0065,Been here before and was great  Came back last week  with my parents for thier anniversary and it took over an hour for the food to come out  Waitress blamed in on a steak which was the worse excuse ever  She was quite rude about it  Lots of other people also complained  50mins for a salad   Would not go back after this experience 
R0065,Been here for first time yesterday but seriously the food did not wow us much  It was alright but not really special  We had a sushi platter  beef bibimbap and steam seafood noodle  The amount of food was huge to be fair but the it was not tasty at all  Sorry but cant really see myself come back soon 
R0065,Been there before and it was fine This time meat overcooked  Vegetables tired  2finger  indentations in my wifes dessert  Not good  Monkfish was undercooked 
R0065,"Best summed up with ""All sizzle no steak ""  Great ambience and thats about all  Not enough staff  average food quality  weak wine list "
R0065,"Best place for a date 
Our waitress was amazing to us and overall was a perfect restaurant 
Amazing food  "
R0065,Birthday dinner with friends
R0065,Booked for 9pm  didnt get seated till 9:45 and didnt get served until 10  We had arranged to meet friends at 11 but this messed up our plans completely  Service and food were grand 
R0065,Booked for landmark birthday occasion   Manager was quite dismissive and offered to have a table in the restaurant in 35 min  which wasnt acceptable  Finally   seated in 15 min with persistent effort  by which time the evening was sploit 
R0065,Booked for landmark birthday occasion    rang in advance and was told we would get extra special treatment and best table  However  was shown to a table in the bar beside large first communion celebrations  Manager was quite dismissive and offered to have a table in the restaurant in 35 min  which wasnt acceptable  Finally   seated in 15 min with persistent effort  by which time the evening was sploit 
R0065,Booked table for 6pm to avail of early bird  available 5   6pm  arrived at 5 45 as suggested but not seated til 6 10 and told we were too late for early bird  It has the ambiance of a cruise ship dining room  in need of an aesthetic update and even the soundtrack was a bit naff  Had high hopes that unfortunately werent met 
R0065,Brilliant service and excellent food perfect for our special occasion  Lounge area downstairs was lovely also for cocktails after the amazing meal 
R0065,"Brilliant service  Food was delicious and the staff are very friendly   Id highly recommend to my friends 
Thanks "
R0065,Brought my wife for the Sunday brunch on mothers day  it was excellent  Ive already decided Im going back for my birthday later in the year 
R0065,Celebrating a friends birthday and the staff made us all feel very welcome and made our meal and evening into a special occasion 
R0065,Client entertainment
R0065,Client entertainment good service
R0065,Considering the prime location and reputation this was very poor experience and value for money  Poor starters  average mains   Cleanliness in the bathrooms was terrible 
R0065,Could not say enough on how well we enjoyed our visit from the moment we arrived till we left    staff are so lovely and food was amazing
R0065,"Couldnt fault this place if I tried 
Food was amazing  cocktails amazing 
Staff were very professional  helpful and so happy 
Ill definitely be returning"
R0065,Couldnt have made my girlfriends birthday meal more memorable  Every aspect was perfect
R0065,"Dear Restaurant Manager 

I was looking forward to dining at your restaurant since before Christmas and last night was a special occasion  This place  was chosen for the steak particularly  We had not been here before  

Starters were good  but the brown bread side was dry  Steak had to be sent back as was overdone  not what I would expect paying 45 euro for a steak  Skinny chips were under cooked  we had asked that they come out crispy  this was not achieved  We were unable to eat them  both portions  Disappointed by this  While my steak was sent back  I was left eating only the half portion of cauliflower  which was delicious  and the other half was removed when the plate was returned  Disappointed this was not recognized by your kitchen  I was given extra chunky chips when the new steak was provided  This was wrong  I had to wait a further 5 minutes for the correct fries to be served  on top of the 12 minutes I already had to wait for the new steak  Again  they were not crispy  Soggy and limp  Unable to be eaten  I couldnt bear to be there one minute longer  Desserts were skipped and we left  What began as a very exciting and pleasant evening ended is utter disappointment  The Malbec was nice 

Sincerely"
R0065,"May I please share my experience with you  This had become quite a special place for my family  When myself and my husband moved back to Ireland  we celebrated our first anniversary  and when we had visitors  we always fit in a visit to this place  So when we learned of the date for my husbands graduation  it was always going to be this place for lunch  However  yesterday when we had lunch it was anything but special  We had a 12 30 reservation  The experience began as it should with a glass of champagne each  which was lovely  We then got seated  and it went downhill from there  Our first course was carried and rapidly placed along with the table beside us  Despite only having 3 4 tables we were all pushed on top of each other  The wait staff whipped our plates away before hurrying back to the pass to get our next course  which was sat waiting  Frankly  we should have gone for carvery given our experience  It would have been a more honest experience and significantly cheaper than the  Euro 220 bill  a cost I would not have begrudged had it been the special lunch I had planned  Alas  I will no longer view as the special place it once was  
A disheartened customer"
R0065,"Definitely not worth the money  Doesnt at all meet our expectations  Food with little or no taste  Many people working in the restaurant  but with little coordination  Highly profiled  but to quote Shakespeare ""Much ado about nothing"" "
R0065,Delicious food  Unreal service  Good value  Great atmosphere  What more needs to be said
R0065,Delightful room with no music  hurrah   albeit noisy  Attentive competent service 
R0065,Dinner was absolutely lovely and I love this restaurant 
R0065,"Disappointed as was highly recommended to us   For the first time ever in any restaurant of any standard we were never offered the option of an A La Carte menu or a drinks menu   Expensive set menu handed to person who escorted us to our table  which was was  Euro 50 per person  I chose sea bass as mains  which were little medallions of fish  My husband had steak  which he said was average   Starters were fine  Desserts were very good  We were asked if we wanted "" a glass of wine"" to which my husband responded a bottle of house white  The waiter said house was Pino Grigio which was fine but  we did not know the price  We had members card which we were not aware should have been presented at reception   There was a bottle of wine on  offer for January with your meal for free as new member  We were charged full price of  Euro 31 50 for Pino Grigio  My husband queried same and the response he got was that they did not know we were members  which is fair enough   However  my husband produced the card and asked them to deduct the price of the wine  The person responded saying the offer was for a cheaper wine  In the end we only paid the difference in the price of the two wines   Staff were polite but  not attentive  Manager came over and asked if all ok after we had finished  Should that not have happened earlier  Place is very big and impersonal  expensive and we walked away feeling ripped off "
R0065,Disappointed they got out bill wrong  occasion was a belated mothers day treat and having to dispute the bill  another tables drinks were on our tab  waso awful in front of mum  And her dinner portion was tiny after asking did the duck starter come as a main  Food is great  Bar downstairs is fab but tainted the night when I had to dispute the bill without so much as an apology 
R0065,Disappointing service on this occasion   We waited over 25 minutes to get served desserts with empty glasses   
R0065,Disappointing  Did not live up to my expectations  The food was average and the service poor
R0065,Disappointing 
R0065,"Disgusted with their customer service  emailed to confirm our booking due to Ophelia storm and was reassured our reservation would still go ahead  We turned up to dinner to find the restaurant was closed with no form of contact  It was booked for our wedding anniversary  
I understand it was for safety reasons but to not contact us I thought was out of order  Our night was ruined "
R0065,Even with a reservation we had to wait for an hour before the table was ready  The Manager was apologetic and we got a complimentary glass of bubbly and a starter but the reservation was late as it was and with the delay it also meant an extra babysitting expense  Also there was no toilet paper in one of the cubicles in the ladies and one was out of order  There didnt seem to be any Gents on the restaurant floor  The food was OK 
R0065,Everything from start to finish was amazing  The food was excellent  great presentation and the staff were excellent also 
R0065,Everything went well until the entrees took a very long time    were delivered by someone other than our waitress  which was okay  but we never saw our waitress again   I finally went to the desk to ask if someone could bring our check    wed finished eating and drinking our wine for at least 15 minutes 
R0065,Excellent all round
R0065,Excellent and vibrant Irish atmosphere  live music  Sunday evening  and tasty food  I returned on the next day for a lunch 
R0065,Excellent as  always  Great Service and Great Food 
R0065,Excellent experience from beginning to end I would highly recommended   thank you
R0065,Excellent food and service to match  Steaks were cooked to perfection 
R0065,Excellent food and service  Waitress noticed I had a parchment with me for graduation and not only commented  for dessert a scoop of ice cream with congratulations written on the plate  Fabulous touch  would highly recommend
R0065,Excellent food and service  Good range of choice on the menu 
R0065,Excellent food surrounding and service very good   really nice place for a special occasion
R0065,Excellent food  staff were so friendly  first time been there  We definitely will be back at Christmas time 
R0065,Excellent food  wine  and  atmosphere  highly recommended

100 percent will return "
R0065,Fantastic all round
R0065,Fantastic food and service  had friends visiting from Amsterdam who were super impressed  Had a table with a view upstairs to the front  Quieter and fab atmosphere  Highly recommended 
R0065,Fantastic food  will definitely go again  everything was perfect no faults
R0065,Fantastic meal  service  ambience for a gathering of friends celebrating the end of a European trip  Highly recommend for a special occasion 
R0065,Fantastic place with superb food and a great atmosphere  We had a great time there and would highly recommend it 
R0065,Fantastix place with amazing food and staff  Would highly recommend 
R0065,"It is a cool place to have drink  especially when you are outside on the balcony  but I wouldt recommend going for dinner there  

The food was very good but the everything else was very poor  You would expect something better from a place like this  

The waiters were nice but really slow  For example: We waited more than 20 minutes to be able to ask for the bill  it took them another 10 to get it and another 10 to get the card machine  

I very much disliked the enterior as it looked cheap  I know thats personal taste  but its a personal review so there you go  and its just not something special  

If you are looking for a place to celebrate a special occasion  skip this restaurant because you are not getting what you are paying for "

If you are looking for a place to celebrate a special occasion  skip this restaurant because you are not getting what you are paying for "
R0065,"Food and Ambience are REALLY good  yes  But there are many options with much better cost/benefit ratio in the city  
The service  though  really need some improvements: They took my order wrong twice and the waitresses lack some sympathy  

Practical personal example: not long ago I ate on a hotel restaurant  I was not a guest  Just went there for a date dinner   The food was as good as  seriously   but they charged me twice less  The ambience was a lot poorer than yours  sure  but the quality of service was exceedingly higher  Overall  I got a much better cost/benefit ratio on that hotel  I would go there for my next date without hesitation  but would have to think about going back "
R0065,"First of all  the sausage rolls are not as good as everyone makes them out to be  Im somewhat of a sausage roll aficionado and these were the worst ones I have ever had  and the most expensive too   The sausage to pastry ratio was all wrong  It was like a gigantic meatball with a ultra paper thin pasty crust  The pasty crust was also one of the worst I have ever had  

Moving on to the lunch  the focaccio chicken sandwiches were quite disappointing  The chicken was gray colored  the roasted vegetables tasted funky  the sauce was bad  and the filling to sandwich ratio was off as well  1"" filling to 5"" bread   Even the side salad tasted bad 

The only redeeming grace of this place was that a woman working there kindly offered up her seat to myself and my girlfriend  But hey  this is a food review site and the high rating that this place currently has is undeserved "
R0065,First time   and  I loved it  The atmosphere was amazing  and  the staff were so friendly  and  helpful
R0065,Five of us had an excellent dinner here   not a mediocre course among us 
R0065,Flew in from Sydney      for the weekend  This was definitely the culinary highlight  We just absolutely loved the place  Highly recommended
R0065,Food and ambiance were very disappointing  it was like we were at a table in the middle of a company christmas party  The  whole place was all huge tables of work parties shouting their heads off  I think we really should have been given a heads up that it may be quite rowdy  as we were a couple  As we would have mad an alternative booking  Service was quite bad too  like we were an afterthought and food was just mediocre 
R0065,"Food and atmosphere was excellent  Tables
Were of excellent width "
R0065,Food and service was great but they need to do something with floors  There so slippy 
R0065,Food nothing special   for price tag 
R0065,Food slow  service terrible and overall not nice food for the price
R0065,Food very disappointing  Salads and bread were not fresh  Pasta over cooked and very dry  Steak was good  Mousse was too heavy and not enjoyable  We left dissatisfied and felt it was very poor value for money  Overall impression of restaurant was style over substance 
R0065,Food was absolutely lovely but service was very slow and when asked for water took 45 minutes before we received it also was very dark
R0065,Food was a little pricey  but was excellent  as was the service we received 
R0065,Food was amazing spit on with the cookjng of the steak   good healthy hearty sharing dishes     Demi the watieress  was lovely
R0065,Food was average  service was poor and rushed   ordered a round of drinks for the table and they never arrived but we were still charged for them  Had a booking for 21 00    at 21 05 we were told the kitchen closes at 21 00  Will not be returning 
R0065,Food was excellent and the staff could not have been more accommodating  i cannot wait to come back in the year year 
R0065,Food was freezing and over priced they even managed to serve me a cold espresso 
R0065,Food was gorgeous  staff were extremely warm and helpful   ambience great  
R0065,Food was great however it took us 20 minutes to get a drink in the lounge before dinner  They were not finished making the last drink when we were brought up to our table  They told us they would bring the drink to us upstairs but forget to bring up the drink and when we reminded them it still took 10 more minutes  Our waiter was horrible  we ended up having to switch servers to a brand new waitress who was much nicer and attentive than our previous veteran waiter 
R0065,Food was like a typical Sunday carvery    beef was tough and chewy  10 percent service charge unnecessary  Roast potatoes were not as described    they were in fact dried up bland and tasteless as was the veg  Not worth the money  However it was a beautiful place and the staff were superb 
R0065,Food was not great  would of expected it to be better for the money that was spent  Only part I would have to say was great was the service  
R0065,"Food was ok  overpriced  
Thanks
Sangria cost too much 30 euros for a very small pitcher of sangria "
R0065,Food  service and decor were all amazing  Really nice place we will be back
R0065,"For a  Euro 30 steak I would expect delicious meal since I ordered a premium  medium cooked fillet steak  Unfortunately it was dry  even a sauce wouldnt improve the taste  The presentation was very poor also  tiny salad in a small ball    I didnt like it  
Service was ok  lovely girl serving but forgot steak knife which I needed to ask for and need to remind the staff about the wine I ordered with dinner  
Overall I would expect more and I wont be coming back "
R0065,"For a restaurant that prides itself for their chargrilled prawns  one would expect them to not be overcooked or swimming in a not very appetising not very garlicky butter  The steak was perfectly well cooked but the bearnaise sause was solid and melted into a greasy puddle when spread  not possible to poor  onto the steak  Nice bread and the staff were excellent  coped very well with the rather large group who were being difficult when paying for their meals  Also a bit odd that you had to go hunting for your own coat  all of which are rather randomly put on the same coat rack with no indication of what belongs to which table  
They will have to pull up their socks if they want to maintain their reputation in the very bustling and increasingly excellent Dublin restaurant market "
R0065,Four of us were very disappointed with wilted salad  over cooked prawns and pork dishes 
R0065,Expensive and not worth the money 
R0065,Friday evening dinner  lively bar for pre drink  restaurant has great atmosphere and character  Service excellent  food fantastic  must have chefs specials  varied wine list  Highly recommended and one of my top five 
R0065,From the girls working at the front desk when we arrived to the bar staff and waiters  each individual working here could not have been nicer or more helpful  The service through out the evening was top class and the standard of food was exquisite  I  have visited with my family and also for work on numerous occasions and I have no doubt I will be back again  I would highly recommend to all my friends and anyone looking for good food  good atmosphere and great service  Cant wait until Im back again and thank you 
R0065,"From we stepped in the door everything was just  s o perfect  
Servers  Food everything tip top  loved it will be back"
R0065,Good food   amazing cocktails and great atmosphere 
R0065,Good night  food was good and  tasty  we were given the wrong menus  only 1 of us out of 5 got the correct menu  staff didnt apologize  We got the pre theatre menu  and  portion size was very small  5 chips with the steak  vegetables with my salmon dish was non existent  Flat white coffee was barely warm  Staff are friendly  and  wine was nice  Overall potion size is very small  Only 2 hour slots given to tables so felt rushed towards the end  When we finished the wine staff didnt offer to get a second bottle or offer top up of other drinks  Staff attentive when you arrive taking your coats and  drinks offered by bar staff is nice Wont be rushing back anytime soon
R0065,Gorgeous food excellent service made for a good evening
R0065,Gorgeous restaurant staff all very friendly and attentive

R0065,Great place for dinner  the service was really good and the food excel   Perhaps a bit noisy because it is an open space  but great overall 
R0065,Great restaurant  We were seated very quickly  the food and service was great  The price was also very affordable for such a nice restaurant 
R0065,Great service as always    Lovely atmosphere   Attention is second to none

R0065,Great venue  great service  a bit overpriced though for the Valentines menu  and it wasnt great   stick with a la carte menu in future 
R0065,Great venue and setup for a large dinner during a busy conference week   Staff was helpful and accommodating 
R0065,Had a fab meal here and will definitely be back again
R0065,Had a fantastic birthday meal on Saturday    All the staff were excellent and attentive
R0065,Had a nice meal but unfortunately we were kept waiting until 9 45 when we were booked for 9pm  Also in my booking I specified it was a birthday dinner for my wife and that I would appreciate a small desert and acknowledgement after dinner which never came  We were also charged for someone elses drinks on our bill which I just checked by chance  Food was pretty good  Will probably be back again sometime 
R0065,Had an excellent dining experience here  It has the perfect combination of fine dining without being too pretentious  The menu offered plenty of choice at reasonable prices  I highly recommend the steak  probably the best Ive had in Dublin  Service was extremely quick with friendly staff  Ill definitely be coming back 
R0065,"Had lovely meal  Staff very attentive  Wine choices great  Good value for money  
Nice to see gluten free options "
R0065,Had my family visiting from the US and Ive been here many times before and always found it great  however it all turned sour on this occasion after my brother ordered a dish and was presented with a totally different dish that he didnt ask for and the waiter kicked up a fuss as if my brother was lying  The manager then came over and appeared to be quite annoyed too judging by his tone after asking what the problem was  The correct dish finally came out but everyone elses food was cold waiting for the final dish to arrive  This really spoilt the evening and created a sour and toxic atmosphere after this  Couldnt believe how bad the waiter was  attitude was appalling and this has definitely put us off going again 
R0065,Had pasta for main course   was tasteless and cold  Husbands steak was cold but didnt say anything as we were in a hurry to go to concert  Desert was not fresh   not made that day
R0065,"Had such a fabulous time here on Monday evening  Conducive to relaxing in a beautiful environment attentive service and scrumptious food 
Thank you"
R0065,"Had the pre theater menu  while I understand that this is a cheaper option  both myself and my husband ordered the 8oz steaks  cooked medium   When they came out they were extremely thin  I understand that its a small set menu steak  and very overcooked  which left it v tough  We had been really looking forward to our visit  as family had visited the week before and were raving about the quality of the meal  however that wasnt our experience 
Everything else about the visit was very good   ambiance  staff  surroundings   but overall we were left very disappointed with our experience"
R0065,Having looked forward to this dining experience  I was so disappointed in the quality of the food  I had the duck salad as a starter and it lacked any flavour  It was almost like it was too cold and too old to taste and as if the chef hadnt quite decided on the flavours so as a result it was bland and only tasted good with the addition of the pesto which was served with the bread  My dining partner had the fish cakes which again lacked flavour  They were mainly mashed potato with a little fish  needing the chilli sauce to make them tasty   We both decided to have the fillet steak which were cooked as ordered   medium  and  medium rare   The Gubeen sauce was a dish of melted butter with oil and parsley   The only taste was of melted butter with garlic  If there was any cheese in it   it was probably waved over the sauce  Being a fan of Gubeen cheese  it was a huge disappointment   The pepper sauce was definitely a lot better  The seasonal vegetables were lovely but the chunky chips left a lot to be desired   They tasted of refried left over potatoes with the main flavour being of soap  All in all we left disappointed   feeling overcharged for poor quality food  This place is over priced and poor quality 
R0065,We had a loyalty card which the server came back for after we paid and never brought back to us  My partner decided not to look for it even though there was a promise of free wine next time we come  The feeling was were not coming back  the food is not worth it  I wont recommend this restaurant to anyone   feeling there are so many more nearby which give better quality and definitely better value
R0065,"Having visited the restaurant for several family and work occasions previously with no complaints we were very disappointed at our experience on Wednesday 19th  Our issues are primarily around the quality of the food served and the associated price  For starters the fish cakes were ""tepid"" with very little fish and while the prawns were advertised with Chorizo this was non existent   My wife had the Pork for main course and this was as tough as boots   I had the Prawns as the main course and was equally disappointed as my wife was with her starter for the same reasons   One does not mind paying a price when the quality of the food supports same but unfortunately the food on this occasion left a lot to be desired especially when one is paying above average prices "
R0065,Highly dissapointed with food  Small portions  We made reservation for table and we were asked to leave after 2 hours  For the prices  not cheap  in restaurant its not nice to being asked to leave a table because other people reservations    restaurant should made enough time for each reservation  Long waiting for food 
R0065,Highly recommend  Food delicious  Service fantastic  Setting really nice 
R0065,I am writing to complain about a recent dinner I had in your restaurant on Saturday night May 12th  I have never been so disrespected in a restaurant in my entire life   The entire meal was a mess  It was a very special occasion  and  the entire evening was ruined due to the service my friends  and  I received  The waiter made several inappropriate comments towards me  one of which was in regard to a request I had for a cocktail due to allergy issues  When I asked for a cocktail without an ingredient she laughed and made a joke out of me in front of my friends  My friends steak had to be sent back 3 times due to the waiter getting the order wrong  3 times   When the waiter brought desserts over we were under the impression they were free of charge but this was also not the case 
R0065,Very poor service overall  Avoid this place 
R0065,I arrived with my boyfriend for our reservation for 9:15pm we had arrive at 8:50pm the lady as the reception said we were early so to have a drink at the bar   I had my drink and it was now 9:30pm and nobody had came to use and let us know the table was ready so I asked one of the bar staff and she said she will go and check for me  then after another 10 mins a lady came over and said sorry for the delay and brought us to the table      a lot of people around us came in after us and were not waiting as long as 30 mins  I personally think they forgot about us which was disappointing  
R0065,"I arranged a Table for 2 for myself and my wifes anniversary and I was not expecting what we received  We were seated beside the Window in a very nice quite private room and it was fantastic as both myself and my wife do not like too much noise and people  The staff were brilliant and the food was gorgeous no complaints 5 star all the way highly recommend and we will be going back 

Thanking You
PaulS"
R0065,I attended for a romantic meal with my husband  The food was delish  I will return 
R0065,I booked on Wednesday 07th Nov for my boyfriends birthday and I called the main phone number on Wednesday afternoon to ask if when ordering desert the chef could write Happy Biryhday on the plate  I was disappointed when this did not happen  This was my first time to the restaurant  The lady who took my phone call asked for my name and the time I had booked and informed me that this would be done  It is an expensive restaurant so what makes the difference is the little things that make our visit personal 
R0065,The food was good and the service was good but due to my small request that did not happen I was disappointed in my overall visit
R0065,I booked this restaurant for my wifes birthday before we went to a show  it was fantastic in every way  as the restaurant filled up it came alive  the staff were super friendly and very alert  I would highly recommend this restaurant  we will be returning soon 
R0065,I could not tick even one of the recommendations listed above  I will not be back  The dining room was freezing cold   no heating on one of the coldest days of the year  People wearing coats to keep warm  Food was also cold  at best  Luke warm  Had to ask for desert twice  Not an overall good experience  I filled out the customer review form which came with my bill 
R0065,"I do not normally leave reviews but I must say I was quite disappointed with the service we recieved on Sunday  I had heard great things but unfortunately our experience did not match up   The bar staff were nice and I liked the popcorn on arrival  a qwirky touch  

Once we went upstairs  the staff came across as flustered and uninterested despite there being a number of empty tables  Plates were slammed onto the table and there was an overall sense that our table was less important then others  

Upon requesting the bill  we then waited 15 minuted to pay  before leaving our table and asking a member of staff where we can pay which was met with a disgruntled �oh  your paying by card �   the gentle man  a manager I believe based on his attire  who brought us the bill did busy laps of the room an seemed to ignore the fact that we were ready to pay  

All in all I am not Sure that we will be back "
R0065,I dont know what the fuss is about this place  Did not like it 
R0065,"I dont know what the fuss is about this place  It was very busy on a Saturday morning and we were happy to get a table  
I ordered a latte and a salmon  cream cheese bagel and it came with a small side salad  To be honest  there was nothing special and I was a bit disappointed as my friend had raved about it "
R0065,I found a piece of red string in my salad and was told it would be taken off the bill only to find out my bill was somehow more expensive than 2 three course menus should be 
R0065,"I found the overall experience quite unpleasant due to many reasons: 

  first of all  the guy at reception was quite pushy as he was trying to sell us drinks before dinner  when we clearly stated we didnt want to drink anything;
  the place was quite noisy when we entered the dining room and stayed that way for the whole evening;
  food quality was not what I expected from ""the best restaurant in Dublin City Centre"": the goat cheese starter was a joke  pork meat was hard as a rock  ""truffle"" fries were regular frozen fries with a white truffle flavoured cream on top  the ""chocolate and orange delice"" I ordered for dessert was a quite poor chocolate cake with no ""delice"" factor in it "
R0065,I found the overall experience quite unpleasant
R0065,"I had really liked this place the last time I visited but this time it was a bit ""Meh ""  We were brought bottled water we didnt ask for  The food was good but our table was a bit far away and they had no tartare sauce "
R0065,I have been here many times  Service and food are exceptional from the time you step foot in the door you are well looked after 
R0065,I have previously eaten at this Restaurant and all had been very positive experiences  However this time the service and quality of the food was not up to the usual standard  Monkfish was bland  one not even cooked thoroughly  Fillet steak was very fatty  Medium Rare steaks came out Medium well  The parfait was frozen  During the meal the waiter did not come to ask how the meal was  Upon telling both the waiter when finalising the bill  and the Maitre D upon leaving the restaurant we were responded to with nonchalance  I am disapointed     
R0065,Unfortunately  we waited a long time for our courses  we arrived at 2045 and did not receive our 2230  We were also not seated in the featured on the website  There was a table of middle aged men next to us swearing regularly which was uncomfortable  the food was moderately good 
R0065,The food was really bad  Undercooked
R0065,Food was horrendous  My friend had the cannelloni and to be honest the presentation was awful and she said it was tasteless  
R0065,The bill was very high considering the poor quality food  3/4 of us didnt finish our food 
R0065,"I surprised my boyfriend for dinner date here and it was brilliant  Reception staff  bar staff   and  Michael the waiter who looked after us were all just fantastic  smiles  and  little chats was really lovely   We had steak  and  it was the best of all weve tried in Dublin  They served our dessert with ""Happy Birthday""  Will highly recommend "
R0065,I think this restaurant may be good however we were seated in a �Dead Zone with no service   we received our bread and wine and ordered our food   then never saw another waiter for 1 hr  at which point we walked out   they saw this and were apologetic   however damage was done and we will never return there    
R0065,I think this restaurant is really not worth
R0065,I treated my mam at the weekend for her 60th birthday  I have been here with my husband and we loved it that was why i chose it  The food and wine was fab however we were seated beside a table in a small room off the main restaurant and they were beyond loud and their use of language was disgraceful  We could not hold a conversation  Members of staff apologised to us a few times but not once was the other table asked to keep it down or were we offered a new table  despite requesting one  We asked to sit at the bar in order to finish our drinks in peace and we were told that was not possible  We certainly dont mind anyone enjoying themelves but this was beyond  It really tainted our night and unfortunately  I wouldnt be in a hurry back   Although the meal was nice  we were unable to enjoy it  What was meant to be a relaxing meal turned out to be a massive headache  literally 
R0065,"I was booked a little party for 10 people  but have to wait at least 30mins and we arrived there 15mins before time we made reservation  
Food was ok and nice  come out to main course took forever  starter very good  deserts not so good at all  One of my friend ordered mid rare steak but come out well done "
R0065,I was highly disappointed with the venue overall 
R0065,I felt I was let down by the resturant as the weekend was a surprise for my partners 30th  I was informed by many that this was a mess 
R0065,I was meeting an old college friend I havent seen in a year  It was the first time I went to this place and I wouldnt go back  The food was lovely a little overpriced but the service was annoying  We sat outside on the balcony at 6pm on a sunny evening and it was quiet only two other tables  The waiters I think there was 4 kept coming over and asking us to order  I nicely told the waiter Id call him when we were ready but that just meant the other ones came over instead  It was very annoying and we felt so rushed we ordered  ate and left   My friend said she wouldnt go back either  There are plenty of restaurants in Dublin with similar menu so I will just go there instead 
R0065,I was really looking forward to dining in here and was impressed with initial greeting all was quite promising  Then we are brought to our table which initially was fine as the two large tables either side of us were empty     well that all changed by the time we had finished our starter  Two rather loud groups were how either side of us and conversation was even a challenge over the noise never mind the space for waiters waiting those tables who tripped at least twice on my chair while doing so  We were now also left waiting to order dessert a ridiculous amount of time while these large groups were seen to and in fairness I had now pretty much decided I wouldnt be back  My steak was quite tiny and quite average and my husbands monkfish the same not good value at all   disappointed with the meal  service and ruined ambience but did like the interior and general look of the place and front of house receptionists were very welcoming 
R0065,I was so disappointed in the whole night here it was my dads 80th birthday party we had the private dining room and they set up 3 separate tables which ment we had our backs to each of the tables the food wasnt great for the price we paid they put bottles of water on the tables and kept filling our glasses but didnt or wouldnt think to mention to us that it would cost  Euro 100 for the water alone  Euro 4:50 a bottle of water by the way i could go on about this place but i havent to time to get annoyed i just wont be going there again neither will the 20 people that was with me 
R0065,I was so impressed with the place in every way thanks so much will be back again very soon
R0065,"I went for dinner on a Sunday evening  Even if on their website they had a pre theatre offer for Sunday  3 courses for 25 euro  when I got there  they gave us the menu with 3 courses for 30  I was fine with this  even if its not fair play  Other thing upset me more   the waitress was cleaning the tables beside us  and she was always there  taking our privacy  I felt embarrassed to stay longer  even if we were there only for an hour  I understand that staff wants to go home early  but its not my fault that it was a quiet evening and they didnt have too many bookings 
The food was great  like always "
R0065,I will be writing to management separately  But as spectacular as the setting is I think �chaos� is the one word that sums up our experience on Friday night 
R0065,I will be writing to management separately such bad experience
R0065,I have heard so much about this place and was really excited about going  While its a beautiful venue  the service was incredibly slow   It looked like they didnt have enough staff on the ground and it took ages to get served  My husband ordered after dinner drink and they never delivered it  when I asked the waitress   she said the bar was too busy so perhaps a wine would be quicker   We couldnt find anyone at end of night to pay our bill  so we walked up to a counter and waited to pay  Of course  my husband left a  generous tip as its part of his culture and DNA  but I am not sure I would have
R0065,I would recommend but I wouldnt be running back to be honest
R0065,"I would recommend it as Ive been there loads and never had a bad experience until now so putting it down as a ""once off"""
R0065,Ive been coming back here every year for the past 4 years  Every time they have exceeded my expectations with the food  the service  and atmosphere  A great experience overall  I highly recommend this restaurant 
R0065,"Ive  been on numerous occasions and different times 
The ambiance staff food are consistently very good 
The pre theatre menu excellent value for money and a great choice 
I would highly recommend this place for all and any age group and function "
R0065,If you want overpriced  over cooked and under seasoned food  this is your place  Shrimp app was rubber  Sauce on the steak had virtually no seasoning  Fish cakes were the texture of mash with little flavor and seasoning  Service was poor  We had to ask three times for wine  The server told me the salmon couldnt be cooked medium rare  and that salmon was only cooked the way the chef wanted it  The a gentleman stopped by the table to ask if I wanted the salmon pink  I said yes  and he said no problem  Hence  poorly trained servers  All in all  not well done  Too bad we went to Etto a few weeks earlier and had superb food with excellent service at a better price  Same street  different price but no where near the same league 
R0065,"Immediately shown to our table and service was exceptional  Server was so nice and helpful 
Definitely go again for dinner "
R0065,Incredible food and wine  Always disappoints  Highly recommend
R0065,It is most definitely my number choice for both business and private dining  Superb customer service  quality of food and fantastic ambience  Highly recommended 
R0065,"It is our second time here  We come to Dublin on business  The problem were the main courses  I had the chicken   which was less than ordinary  Actually  the chicken was better on the plane the next day 
My partners steak had no flavor  "
R0065,It was good meal  not sure I would  call this Fine dining  Would I eat there again maybe
R0065,It was good  We were on holiday and dressed a bit too casually but the staff made us feel perfectly comfortable and the 2 teens we had with us loved it  They were challenging each other to try new items off the menu  Nettle Soup   Who would have thought    Very nice and highly recommend 
R0065,It was our first time and we both loved it  The food and service was fantastic 
R0065,It was s large table and we waited up to 20 minutes for drinks to be served  The food was cold when it came  Very unhappy overall as I booked it as a special event for my wifes 30th
R0065,"It was Valentines Day  which to my husband and me is a very special occasion  I booked our table a week in advance  the only available time was 5 30  although until 6 30 it the place was fairly empty of patrons  but the number of staff on the floor constantly running around was beyond me  Unfortunately  we were seated on the corner exactly along 2 of their ""paths""  so during our dinner waiters and hostesses and various gentlemen in suits with hands free wires were passing by at my left and husbands back  touching us on occasion  and that constant commotion was both distracting and source of constant noise  Otherwise the place was fairly quite   although noise on V day would be very understandable  which was ridiculous in an fairly empty restaurant  I must say we finished out meal quicker than planned and left in 1 hour  wanting this experience to end   I doubt I will go back  which is sad "
R0065,Its expensive but worth every penny  Had a lovely time  and the waiters were so good  Service was phenomenal  Cant fault it 
R0065,Jayde  as usual  was an exceptional hostess again and as it was a lovely sunny evening  arranged a table on the terrace which was lovely 
R0065,Just a very disappointing experience from the outset  Tasteless food which was not worth the high price 
R0065,Just lovely  bit on the pricey side  but excellent service  atmosphere and thoroughly enjoyed the food 
R0065,"Lamb chop was grilled too  Pink is the best  
I requested wine list but waitperson haz no koelrdge of wine  No sommelier sefved "
R0065,Last sat   my colleague went to dinner for our Christmas party and food was terrible  Starter and main was to long between  Place is too busy and noisy  My food coming cold   My friends food coming test less  
R0065,Last sat   my colleague went to dinner for our Christmas party and food was terrible  Starter and main was to long between  Place is too busy and noisy  My food coming cold   My friends food coming test less  Very bad experience for expensive place 
R0065,Left after one hour of waiting for table  Completely unacceptable 
R0065,"Let me start by saying i love this place and am a regular customer the other branches in town  �I was working in Ballbridge for the last few week so came in here for lunch and received the absolute worst customer service ever  �
The guy who served me who I think is the manager was rude to a point that was nearly abusive  �I had a bit of change in my pocket so paid with this rather then breaking a note   he was absolutely disgusted that I would pay with change and said ""Do I look like a beggar  ""  �He then went as far as to tell me not to bother coming back if I was going to come in with small change  �As I have worked in restaurants and bars most of my adult life I know it can be a little annoying when someone hands you a bunch of change but money is money and you should be glad of their custom   I would understand If I went to buy something for a  Euro 100 and was paying in 1c coins but obviously this wasnt the case  

Goes without saying I will not be back to this Subway again"
R0065,Little bit expensive but worth it  Made my dinner date perfect  Would love to go there again  Food was amazing as well as drinks
R0065,Love the food here  Yet our waitress was very unfrendly and seating was not great despite booking in advance  This put me off returning 
R0065,"Loved this place when we came two years ago and didnt disappoint again this time  
Fabulous food  Brilliant cocktails  Great staff "
R0065,Loved it from begining till the end  Excellent food and service  Will certainly be back 
R0065,Loved it  brilliant night  Very friendly and welcoming staff  Great music at the cocktail bar and exceptional cocktails   
R0065,Loved it  wonderful place to eat and staff were excellent
R0065,Loved the bar area  service excellent  craft beer lovely
R0065,Lovely area for pre dinner drinks  Not busy as it was a Tuesday evening and the service was excellent  Good choice on the menu and the restaurant itself is a lovely setting  Would highly recommend
R0065,Lovely food lovely place but terrible service could do with more staff we waited an hour for drinks to arrive at table also had table booked for 9 15 and were just eating dessert at midnight 
R0065,Lovely place   45 minute delay between starters and main course   I had to ask what was happening   Two of the party had steaks   dont know how the chef made such a bad job of them   tough   The mash was stuck to the plate like gloop and my skinny chips were white and soggy    We did complain on the night but were still charged for one completely untouched meal   Would never go back
R0065,Lovely food  friendly and attentive staff  Love the extra touches that come with being a gold card member  Will definitely be back
R0065,Lovely food  great service  our waiter jan was attentive and helpful  good atmosphere
R0065,Lovely food  surroundings and staff  catered for our childs allergies very well  Overall great dining experience
R0065,Lovely lovely evening for my friends 40th  thank you x
R0065,Lovely meal and great service  Nice bar waiting area before you are seated at your table  Reasonable price 
R0065,Lovely meal  Great service  Earns its name as one of the best in they city 
R0065,Lovely spot  Food and service is a cut above the rest 
R0065,Lovely Sunday lunch 
R0065,Many thanks to the staff for a super night; Food and service was excellent as always 
R0065,Meal was good  service was unusually poor this visit 
R0065,Meal was outstanding  Our table for 2 was flanked by large groups with kids under 5  The manager kindly moved us to a quieter table  Would love to go back 
R0065,Messed up two dry aged filets  Came out super rare then both came back well done after being sent back  Very dissatisfied 
R0065,My mom and I went there on the recommendation of our airport transfer driver and it was an excellent choice  We arrived early so that we could enjoy the lounge  Our dinner was delicious   the lamb skewers were amazing   The staff was attentive and courteous  We were there for 3 hours and enjoyed every minute  Highly recommended 
R0065,My parents were made to feel very special on their 50th Wedding anniversary
R0065,My partner fell on a incredibly slippery surface on a wooden floor injuring her upper thigh and sustaining serious bruising and trouble walking A out dated drinks menu is presented listing wines staff say are no longer available
R0065,"My wife had the Monkfish and I had the Steak  Both our mains were overcooked  I requested mine to be cooked Medium well  following the menu guide and it came out Well done  For a  Euro 40 steak I would have expected better  Perhaps this is why they had availability on short notice on a bank holiday weekend  Starters were excellent 
Nice bar  friendly staff but we wont be back "
R0065,"Newyears dinner  Just amazing like always  
Will certainly be back "
R0065,Nice food but nothing special  The vegetarian pasta was bland and tasteless   Found prices very expensive too 
R0065,Nice meal  Good venue 
R0065,Nice place food wasnt great steak was cold  service wasnt great either took along time before someone offerd to take our order ect   wouldnt be rushing bck again
R0065,Nice place  good service  Terrible value for money 
R0065,Nice restaurant but drop in standard from my last visit  steak was paper thin which was particularly disappointing
R0065,No bang for your buck  Food was overpriced  underseasoned and took around 50 minutes to arrive  Sorely disappointed  Food looked promising but was bland 
R0065,Not at all suitable for people with allergies  especially if you have a few of them    The solution they had was basically to just remove a bunch of stuff and not replace by anything  
R0065,The salmon we received looked good but tasted incredibly booring
R0065,Not faults at all   amazing food amazing staff will definitely be coming back
R0065,not the best  had possibly set my expectations too high as it did not live up to them  The venue was like a cattle mart   so loud could barely hear my partner across the table certainly not a romantic venue  Good for big crowds/work lunch/dinner   Food was also mediocre   fillet steak hard to chew but perhaps because it was very raw despite requesting medium rare  I also asked could I have vegetables rather that the salad the steak was accompanied with the reply was no   Desserts however were fab   Dont think id returning anytime soon 
R0065,"oLovely meal 
Food very nice 
Service exceptional 
A little pricey 
But worth it"
R0065,On arrival service was good  As the night progressed food was bland and service was non existent tip was left service disappeared  Not even a thank you  Then had to look for my wifes coat myself which for me looked and felt tacky searching through a rack of coats  for my wifes coat in the middle of the restaurant  Judging by the reviews and location I had great expectations for this restaurant but realistically it was well below par and clearly not up to its known professional high standards 
R0065,For the money you pay in this restaurant I would advise to avoid it  and  go somewhere with a better aimbience  less chaos  and  where they dont drag the rubbish bags through the dining room 
R0065,On first appearances the restaurant gives the impression of being a nice  well to do restaurant  The building and decor is lovely  the greeting staff are excellent but then you enter the dining room  It presents itself with an air of chaos  no one seems to know what theyre doing  service was unbelievably slow  the plates from our bread were never cleared away and not once were we asked if we were enjoying our meal  
R0065,"On the night of my dinner with my family that came to visit me as this was a special occasion  There were 3 separate servers that took care of my table and It seemed that they were all just ""Filling in"" as the waiter seemed very new and did not know his way around  He brought me the specials menu  Sunday Brunch  and had I not know we would have had a limited choice of meals  I asked the waiter for the regular menu and he did not know about the regular menu so he had to go away and find out which took quite some time  When he came back it seemed to have all gone down hill from there as the service was poor  No one checked in our table  No one came by to take our drinks order or to go over some of the dietary requirements for the kids  I had to call over the Maitre D about 4 times to get service and to ask for water for the table as all the waiters just simply passed by without even glancing at the table  Needless to say we did not get the food that we wanted as the tomahawk steak was already gone and it was only 7:30 PM so that was a letdown We also had issues with the kids menu  I also requested a desert with a message to be brought to the table  I again had to ask for the desert menu and even after ordering some items the desert with the message was not brought to the table   This I confirmed when the young lady called me to confirm our reservations for the night   I am very cautious about going back as I had such a great experience on the 2 times before so I hope that this was just an off night for the restaurant "
R0065,On the night our server continuously avoided one member of the group  Blatantly refilled everyone else wine and water glasses and continuously left this one member to themselves  Food and value for money was great but the service was a serious negative 
R0065,ONE OF THE BEST MEALS IVE EVER EATEN  WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE TRAVELLING TO DUBLIN  THE FILLET STEAK WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY
R0065,Only one small issue  the dessert wine I ordered was brought a long time after the dessert but overall a lovely experience
R0065,Ordered steak  That was done to perfection but everything else was poor  The chips were not hot  the onion rings were tiny and stringy  the salad was over dressed and the sauce was cold  Disappointing for the price  On the plus side  I couldnt fault the service 
R0065,Our family always seem to end up here for celebrations and birthdays  Another lovely visit  had last week  Will always come back
R0065,"Our party of five  very poor table received  which meant 3 of us were looking at a rack of coats    
We were on the Christmas Lunch menu  starters were good  main course of Turkey and ham was very salty to taste  Salmon was good  deserts were good 
Teas and coffee were cold  had to send back 
Staff not very attentative to our table over all "
R0065,Our table was forgotten about  It was s large table and we waited up to 20 minutes for drinks to be served  The food was cold when it came  Very unhappy overall as I booked it as a special event for my wifes 30th
R0065,Our table wasnt ready at the time of our reservation  The staff wasnt friendly  The steak was well done when we ordered a medium   Never going back and do not recommend it 
R0065,The staff wasnt friendly  The steak was well done when we ordered a medium 
R0065,Our valentines dinner was lovely  the food was really good  one of the best steak Ive  ever eaten  I would recommend it and I would be back   
R0065,Outstanding food  service and atmosphere  When in Dublin  we always go to this restaurant 
R0065,Outstanding from start to finish   great atmosphere  we love going received a gift of a gold card card cant wait to use it again   
R0065,Outstanding  Good price  amazing food and extremely friendly and welcoming staff  Beautiful place 
R0065,Overall a poor experience that would not make me return   After waiting over 30mins for our pre booked table we were shown to a table in the bar area which had been converted into a temporary dining area and not in the main room in order to cram in more covers for the festive season  When we tried to change it was difficult and were made to feel as if we were being a nuisance  Eventually we were moved and were able to start the ordering process  Service was slow and sporadic with items having to be requested multiple times and different serving staff in attendance each time which lacked consistency  Eventually the food arrived and was good but by this time we had been waiting for over an hour to eat I believe we ate around 2230 from our 2100hr reservation  To finish the evening off we were overcharged by around  Euro 70 for items we did not order  To finish off the evening we were then spotted an additional service charge for the appalling service we had received that evening which we asked to be removed for obvious reasons  An apology was given and accepted for the overcharging but too little too late in my opinion  
R0065,Overall disappointing   food was bland  service was barely adequate and lacking personal touch  Fell well short of expectations 
R0065,Overall I have to say I was  disappointed  Our starters were lovely we both had the prawns but our mains sadly were not very good  I ordered the pork which was extremely overcooked and lacked any flavor  My partner had the lamb which was cold when it was served to him   We both instantly regretted not ordering steak which seemed to be the specialty  We both ordered from the A la Carte menu starter and main when we got the bill we were very surprised to see we had been charged for the 3 course special menu which was more expensive even though neither of our dishes we had ordered for our main were on this menu and we were charged an extra supplement for our starters the wood fire prawns  The overall difference in the Bill was 24 Euro   I would have passed this off as an honest mistake had I not earlier seen a post on trip advisor about a similar problem and was very much saddened to see that this must be a common occurrence  We were celebrating our anniversary and even though we didnt order a dessert we had a lovely plate and scoop of ice cream brought to us with happy anniversary written on it which was a lovely touch  I dont think I would be put off going back in the future but I wouldnt be in a rush when there are so many great restaurants in the vicinity 
R0065,Overrated place with meat inflated with water  The place is crammed with tables and it looks like youre in a wedding 
R0065,Perfect food  venue  drinks and ambience   Cannot rate highly enough    
R0065,Perfect venue  Energetic  Lively great atmosphere  Super service and super staff  It ticks all the boxes for a enjoyable evening 
R0065,"Plan the night out with my boyfriend for a date 
As expected  the food was fab along with fantastic cocktails  which I highly recommend for someone whos looking for good food / drink with good vibe"
R0065,"Problem 1   For my husband to avail of the roast beef  I had to order the same as him 
Problem 2  It was not cooked medium well 
Problem 3  The waiter topped up our glasses with water without us knowing we were charged  Euro 7 a bottle
Problem 4  For what we got  2 roast beefs  2 chicken goujons  1 glass of wine and bottles of water  and what we paid   Euro 122   we genuinely could get nicer elsewhere 

Very disappointing"
R0065,Quality and Flavour of food didnt match pricing  Expected great things when it came to the steak as a main course but this certainly did not occur 
R0065,Quite possibly the worst service Ive ever received at a restaurant in my life   I had to at multiple times ask the manager to get service at our table  After numerous complaints still got charged full pop  Was shocked that even dessert and/or coffee was comped even after multiple apologies from different managers 
R0065,A truly disappointing experience all around 
R0065,Raging at our meal on Saturday evening myself and my husband had rib eye steak and it was disgusting  totally full of fat told the waiter he said it could be replaced our family had already had there mains so we said no thanks and continued with desert  we asked for the bill and the two steaks were still on it  my husband complained and they said they usually would not take it off but will this time disappointed in the service  have ate there on numerous occasions and would not go back 
R0065,"Really average food for the price paid was really dissapointed with the lemon ""tart"" as what I had expected was a little lemon tart with pastry what were we presented was not that  I thought the waiter were very inattentive we asked one of them for drink he was a food waiter so said he would get someone which took over 20 minutes and we were all sitting there with no drinks we avtually had to ask again to get someone to come over  It was a Sunday night so was not overly busy to have to wait that long  I have been to this restaurant previously and had a much better experience hence why I came for the third time but now I am not sure if I would go again "
R0065,Really enjoyed dinner   Great food and great service
R0065,Really enjoyed my dining experience  The atmosphere was great and the food superb  Overall a fantastic evening 
R0065,Really enjoyed the food and hospitality of the restaurant
R0065,REALLY EXCELLENT   VERY CONSISTANT  SUPER STAFF  WOULDNT GO ANYWHERE ELSE
R0065,Really nice food  All the staff appeared to love what they were doing  Will definitely be back 
R0065,Reasonable food from a very standard fare menu   All food was good but menu could do with a little more flair
R0065,Restaurant is amazing and all the staff are attentive  thank you for your service  will be back in near future 
R0065,Retirement for my dad clebration went well 
R0065,Reviews from our Staff dinner on Tuesday evening were all very good  Thank you 
R0065,Sadly disappointed with our Christmas dinner here  The table was not ready when we arrived and then we were rushed to finish 
R0065,Seated at 8   Food served at 9:20   No communication on the delay  Order drinks and they forgot   Manager walked by and asked about our meal   I explained we loved the food but the delay in being served was disappointing   He offered no apology or explanation which was surprising 
R0065,Service extremely quick  Nearly too quick but food was excellent 
R0065,"Service was excellent  Food amazing 
Cant wait to come back"
R0065,Service was extremely slow  One waiter kept coming back to see if we had gotten our drinks which we hadnt  Food wa s tasty when it arrived  However  I had literally put my cutlery down  and  was still chewing my last mouthful when my plate was taken from me  It was a disappointing experience as had dined there previously  and  enjoyed it 
R0065,Service was incredibly slow and unacceptable   Our waitress was rude and dismissive   It was a hot day  the restaurant was sweltering  and we had to ask for our water to be refilled repeatedly   We waited an eternity for our food to finally get served but it was underwhelming and poor quality   this restaurant used to be nice but its reputation is not great anymore   and now we know why 
R0065,"Service was just too fast  No pause between courses  Starter was on the table before we took first sip of the aperitif  

Very loud due to high ceilings reverberating sounds  food was ok but not a reflection of the cost "
R0065,Service was poor just lack of attentiveness from the waitress and lack of knowledge too despite being quite when we got there so before it got busy  The atmosphere felt like as if we were in a food market mainly due to the high volume of people in at the same time  It also felt like waiters just dropped the food and left 
R0065,"Service was really slow  long waiting time between courses  staff not overly attentive or present  incorrect drinks  
Steak was cooked rare when asked for medium  
Wouldnt go back and wouldnt recommend to others "
R0065,Service was the worst I have ever experienced at a restaurant  Despite speaking to staff on numerous occasions we waited 55 mins for a drink order to arrive   
R0065,Simply too noisy and not worth it  Waitress made a huge mistake in our bill that I caught before paying 
R0065,So expensive for what we got    Beautiful room  Breads were good  No need for the pestos  Prawns were ok   not v flavoursome and swimming in oil  Salad was lacklustre  Staff were ok  Didnt seem to be v organised/experienced  For example: someone cane with the card machine to take payment after we had paid 
R0065,Spent New Years Eve   simply outstanding  Amazing food  venue  staff  Keep up the great work 
R0065,Staff and decor outstanding  Great place to go as a treat 
R0065,Staff are disappointing   they ignored us and were rude  Food was just ok and its incredibly over priced  Its quite dark also  it was just ok
R0065,"Staff are some of the best weve ever encountered  especially Jack  he was excellent  and good fun too   
Will definitely return"
R0065,Staff excellent   Starters great   Tortelloni main was dry and bland  Sirloin steak gritty 
R0065,Staff were not efficient and food was rather disappointing 
R0065,Star service from start to finish   great location and ambiance and food was second to none
R0065,"Steak wasnt warm 
Ordered mash and didnt get served     "
R0065,Such a great ambiance was a lovely way to spend Christmas Eve the food was amazing as always
R0065,Superb food   Sweet potato soup was delicious 
R0065,Superb on every level    food  drink  ambiance all top notch 
R0065,Surf and turf is a must  Lovely old building  very busy restaurant but waiting staff very attentive
R0065,Table booked for 7pm starters mains and dessert finished by 7 45pm  wasnt given a chance to digest one course and the next was out on  Felt rushed into finishing to probably accommodate and next sitting  Waiters were nice and dont think this was there fault but the food was out too fast and felt like a fast food restaurant rather than a nice restaurant  Food was lovely but no time to appreciate it  Spent  Euro 150 for dinner for two and would of gone back had the experience been more enjoyable 
R0065,Terrible service  Poor value  Rude employees  Would never return or recommend
R0065,The architecture is beautiful  The gardens beautiful and well maintened  Interiir decour very tasteful  Menu wonderful as was the food and service   cocktails delicious  I would highly recommend
R0065,The dinner was not bad  although the waiter got the salads wrong and my husbands steak was rare  definitely not medium rare  The waiter was not attentive  The ambiance was nice  good location and the deck looked inviting  All told it was a meh experience 
R0065,The food here ranges from lousy to very bad  One plate had to be returned  The stake was poorly seasoned and was a thin  sad piece of meat itself  There are many other places in the area with far better food without such a high price tag  For the discerning diner  take a pass 
R0065,The food the service and the place all get an A1   
R0065,The food was bland and overpriced  The pre  theatre menu however was good value 
R0065,The food was divine from start to finish  We had such a fabulous night and the venue itself is beautiful 
R0065,The food was great and the ambiance was terrific  Service was a slow and it took an unimaginable amount of time to receive our bill 
R0065,The food was gorgeous and the staff very friendly 
R0065,The food was more like pub food  not a high end Resturant it was just average 
R0065,The food was sensational the ambience is great loved everything 
R0065,The food was very good  Everything was very professional  The service was very professional  the friendliness was very professional  but the absolut most important thing was not there        doing with heart  We felt like in a factory and felt not warmly welcome 
R0065,The food was very nice  although the service was a bit slow  we had drinks while we were waiting to be seated a Chardonnay and a Heineken  we ordered the same drinks when seated at our table   these were much more expensive   The only other problem was the Roof Terrace was closed due to a private function being held there it would have been nice to know this before booking  but Wed definitely go back as we really like it there 
R0065,The food  service and ambiance was fantastic  The drinks and wine list had plenty of options  Great venue with great food and staff
R0065,The front of house downstairs  were so pleasant and friendly  But in the restaurant  was a completely different experience  which is a shame 
R0065,The girl who served us was bordering on rude  Never smiled during the entire interaction and constantly looking away while we were giving her our order  When asking if everything was okay it was so obvious that she was only going through the motions  On this visit we will not be going back  Furthermore for what we got it was extremely pricey 
R0065,The noise level from uncontrolled children was overpowering and ruined what should have been a very special occasion with visitors from New Jersey  We could not enjoy the get together or the meal 
R0065,The noise level way very high  There were loads of servig staff but impossible to get their attention  Table service was poor enough  intrusive leaning and not removing glasses etc that would not be used  Had to ask for glasses for beer bottles and to get rid of wine glasses from table   took forever to get someone to even look at us for that  They stopped their pre theatre menu an hour earlier than  other days  5:30 booking and no pre theatre  we were literally going to the theatre  I get Saturdays are prime days but just ask for table back by 7 and allow pre theatre  A bit pretentious without the quality to even justify it  Food was ok very edible but not fantastic or memorable 
R0065,"We ditched the place half way through mains and went to other  place for dessert 
 
Avoid unless you can find nowhere else "
R0065,"The restaurant was freezing at 1330 on a Sunday  Its a very big hall and with no heating turned on  guess what  It gets cold  
Starters had the air of being 99 percent prepared the night before and just touched up before serving  
The mains arrived and the mashed potatoes were cold  the table beside us were also heard complaining about the same issue   The shared rib of roast was also not on the right side of hot  and was a average piece of meat at best   
Staff were average   interested but hardly enthusiastic  The place caters for large groups akin to bus tours and hen groups "
R0065,"The service is very slow at the bar when we ordered a pre dinner drink   The bar staff preferred to talk to the cocktail waitress   it took over 15 mins to order one bottle of wine and 2 beers    Dinner   lamb and salmon was order cooked tp the point of being dry  White wine was warm  the red wine was hot and the port wine was cooking   The manager who ""comped"" half the food did not really care that much    This could be a great restaurant but it seems that they have settled for that typical corporate mediocre style place   Dublin has so many great restaurants   just do not go here "
R0065,The service was disappointing  Of 4 steaks ordered  2 were not cooked as instructed  No one topped up our wine glasses throughout the evening  Service felt rushed and as a result mistakes were made  Expensive for what it turned out to be 
R0065,The service was terrible  Its unlikely that we would return  given the cost for the service 
R0065,The service was terrible  We looked up a lot of reviews and decided to go there for the steak and ambience and were severely disappointed by the poor service  The manager was kind and tried to accommodate us by removing items from the bill 
R0065,The service was very good  Staff were friendly and efficlient   The food was disappointing  The fish cakes for starters were fine but a little bland  I had the rib eye steak for my main  It was really really fatty  My friend had the salmon and pasta  She thought it was flavourless  The ice cream for desert was really nice 
R0065,The services is 5 star everybody is so friendly The food is soooo good and great value Really surprise us the perfect quality restaurant with good price Highly recommend for all friends will definitely go back soon 
R0065,The set menu was extremely poor value for money in my opinion and my friends felt the same 
R0065,"The staff and the food were outstanding  and delicious   and my couple of friends who got married recently  They really enjoyed the overall experience  especially the dessert plate with the bride and groom touch on as it was my present gift to dine with them  
Thank you very much the whole   Restaurant staff for delivering  "" a  top high quality service"" from the moment we stepped in until the end  Thanks a million   not only one single staff but the ""whole team"" indeed    I highly recommend anyone wants to make an unforgettable evening celebration for friends  family and beloved ones    A truly Five Star  unforgettable Monday evening   Well done guys   "
R0065,The staff were extremely pleasant and welcoming  The building itself is very impressive  Really great atmosphere    I highly recommend it for a special occasion or just a treat    super service and attentive without being intrusive  All round excellent  
R0065,"The staffs default mode appears to be ""the extra mile"": first class food  and first class service  "
R0065,"The starters and dessert were really lovely  The main was average  Mash potatoes were dry  The service once we got upstairs was appalling  The first time I can remember when o left a restaurant without leaving a tip  Despite being seated right next to the servers station  where various servers and floor managers gathered throughout the evening  we were pretty much ignored for most of the meal  Our plates were left at our table so long after our starters and mains that I cleared and stacked them myself and left them at the side of the table  It was still another five minutes or more before they were removed  Not once did someone come to top up our wine or water glasses  and eventually I had to call someone over to ask for more water 

Very disappointing service  we had gone to check it out before booking for our sons graduation party   well be booking somewhere else for that "
R0065,There is not atmosphere in the restaurant  It felt like sitting in a canteen  The echo of cutlery and talking  No music to soften the sound
R0065,This had to be one of the worst restaurants I have ever visited  It seemed to be a place full of wannabes  The service was absolutely appalling and somebody needs to teach the waiting staff manners and how to correctly pour wine  This place has huge potential but did not live up to any expectation  This place is more about quantity over quality 
R0065,"This is a beautiful renovated house  but with tacky touches like neon lights and printed leaflets that resemble a take away menu 
Staff is friendly  but the food is really not very good  Pork was dry  chips a bit soggy and everything too bland 
Our bread plates were dirty and had to be sent back 
Quite a disappointment"
R0065,This is about the third time that I have left this restaurant disappointed  We had a reservation for 7pm after a hectic day of Christmas shopping  We werent seated until nearly 7 40  While the service was top class and the starters arrived promptly  it was nearly 9pm before we got our mains   2 hours after our booking time  We were starving  Luckily  the waiting staff noticed the delay before we pointed it out to them and kept assuring us that we werent being forgotten and that they were checking in with the chef regularly  A guy in a suit  manager   came over to apologise and offer us a complimentary glass of prosecco  which was a nice touch and downgraded our blind fury to moderate frustration  When the food did arrive  mine was delicious  however my partners steak had a sinew through it which was disappointing  We were too hungry by that point to complain or request a replacement  The desserts again were delicious and were served promptly  I realise that places like this are busy around Christmas  however I previously had a situation like this in October so that cant be the only issue  It strikes me that if this is occurring regularly  or maybe Im just super unlucky   that they should consider decreasing the capacity of the gigantic dining room to allow the kitchen cope better  On a positive note  the service from each staff member we dealt with was exceptional  Unfortunately not enough to compensate for the long delays  average food and missing the start of the toy show 
R0065,"This is an okay option for late nights out but other than that I dont think Id choose it  the crowd just isnt quite as decent as some of the other ones  The food is alright  consistent like you would expect in a chain  There are plenty of servers to keep everything moving quickly and security to keep the drunk er  people under control   or at least I thought thats what they were for 

This was before I had a guy continually disturbing my friends and I  Yelling insulting things at us while we were trying to eat  The security guard was just a few feet away and the group he was with was clearly finished eating so I couldnt figure out why he wasnt being told to leave us alone as we clearly didnt want to be bothered; and they still didnt after he came closer to us and yelled even more insulting accusations at me personally  Anyway  it wasnt the greatest experience when you cant get some hangover killer with some friends without being bothered continually by other obnoxious people  If you have several guys there  they should try to keep the peace I would think but Im glad it didnt come to any more than that before his friend pulled him away "
R0065,This place never misses the mark on service or quality of food   One of my favorite places in Dublin
R0065,This restaurant really is special  beautiful menu and amazing building  Service second to none and wonderful cocktails too 
R0065,This restaurant was extremely cold  when we saught a seat in a warmer area of the restaurant we were advised that the heating is only turned on in the evening so there would be no warmer area to sit  Given the extreme cold weather Ireland was experiencing I would have thought that the geatingbwould have been turned on earlier   Food was only average 
R0065,This restaurant was highly disappointing  We originally walked by this and expected to get a modern dinner but ended up with bartenders and wait staff that didnt know the menu or cared to serve us  We definitely dont recommend this restaurant 
R0065,This Resturant has dropped it standard big time the quality of the food was poor the service was awful we had to wait 90 minutes to be served out main course very annoying had to ask for drinks we ordered a few times we spent over  Euro 500 between us
R0065,This Resturant has dropped it standard big time the quality of the food was poor the service was awful
R0065,This was a beautiful meal  The steaks ordered were cooked to absolute perfection 
R0065,This was a fantastic experience from the moment we entered the restaurant to the moment we finished  The food was superb  friendly staff and prompt service  highly recommended 
R0065,This was a nice elegant place that you feel posh in it 
R0065,This was my second dinner within a week   The service and food were much better the first time  Maybe it was just an off night
R0065,This was our fourth visit and the best  Excellent did and service  Great Dublin venue with excellent atmosphere
R0065,This was our third time to visit this restaturant  Every time has been as good as the last 
R0065,"To whom it may concern 

My partner and I dined in  this restaurant on Sunday  It was our first time here and I was so disappointed  We had heard so much good things about it but sadly it didnt live up to ones expectations when we first entered the ladies that greeted us were fantastic very friendly and welcoming as were the two gentlemen downstairs behind the bar  

We were seated and the lady that took our order wasnt very friendly jug of water was firmly placed  on the table  steak knife again flung down and fork was a good distance away from where it was supposed to be  I have worked in this industry for over 10 years so I was expecting a friendly prompt service and for her to at least check on us throughout our meal  Upstairs was very cold and lacked ambience and coziness  It was our first night out in months with no child so we wanted to really enjoy it  

But sadly this wasnt the case here  The meal came to 178 euro which wasnt worth it at all for lack of service  As it was a Sunday it wasnt too busy so there was absolutely no excuse for it There was three people  on the table beside us and we overheard them talking to and they were not happy  They left very quickly after their main course 

I never ever leave a bad review but unfortunately this one time I had to  Usually when we go for dinner it would be to marco Pierre whites   Which I will look forward to going back to  

Look forward to your response

Kindest regards"
R0065,"Too loud 
Poor service
Dry dry lamb"
R0065,Total tourist trap   Food was bland  over priced and less than memorable   Pass and keep looking 
R0065,Ugh  Trying to be an upscale restaurant but cramming too many people in at once  Noise level was deafening  and I am one who appreciates the chatter versus the quiet  Table was so close to our neighbor we might as well have been eating with them  At least four different servers for our table  including one manager I think Felt rushed  Food was absolutely awful  however  we did not select the steaks which was namesake so grain of salt 
R0065,Unfortunately I was disappointed with the food  It was overpriced for the standard  In particular three of us had the sirloin steak which was very fatty and just ok  The staff were friendly and the atmosphere was nice except for a smell of cooking popcorn which permeates the dining hall   they serve it with the drinks in the bar       I think for the price tag they need to lift their game substantially 
R0065,Unfortunately our trip was very disappointing  I had anticipated a wonderful evening of excellent food and top class service but found both lacking  There were many large groups also dining and focus was definitely aimed at these leaving my party of 2 unattended and seemingly unimportant  The food got off to a good start with the signature prawns but then failed to impress  Also the desert menu was very limited  when I eventually received the correct menu    Overall we were very disillusioned and disappointed 
R0065,Unfortunately this restaurant has no atmosphere with overpriced and poorly cooked food  The staff however are very nice an service was good  Would not recommend
R0065,Unfortunately we were really unhappy with the service on Sunday 1st of April 2018   We waited ages to give our order  The starter plates hadnt been cleared when our mains arrived  We asked for water and tooth picks three times before they arrived  It took ages for anyone to come clear the table after the main course  then when we eventually got to order dessert the wrong thing was brought out 
R0065,Unfortunately  the service was very very subpar   The general manger was great and very attentive and our initial impressions were very positive   However the GM could only do so much  Our dinner took 45 minutes and it was only after we inquired that we were told the reason   The food turned out to be good   The manger was apologetic and the excuse for the lateness was reasonable   Unfortunately  we were completely ignored by the rest of the staff at the end and it took us about twenty minutes after finishing our meal to finally flag down a waiter   This was about 10:30 and if we didnt know better I would have said the staff was intentionally avoiding us   The restaurant was essentially empty at this point  It left such a bad taste after what had happened earlier that we just cant recommend them 
R0065,Very average meal with pretty average service  No plans on returning as I doubt it gets any better  Disappointed as I had expected much better based on how busy it was and is 
R0065,Very bad quality of fillet steak  this put a big disappointment on the overall experince
R0065,Very cosy and quiet atmosphere  good service and amazing food 
R0065,Very disappointed with the food it had obviously been left waiting under heated lamps prior to serving skin on sauce etc
R0065,Very disappointed with the quality of food and service we got when celebrating a birthday there  The steak was pretty grisly and the attention to detail from the staff was also poor  forgetting wine order  dessert special request   I complained to the manager and in fairness to him he remedied the situation as best he could but overall not the dining experience I expected at that price  Many other restaurants in Dublin offering better food  service and value 
R0065,Very disappointed  I had booked a table for myself and my sister for Saturday night at 8pm  On arriving the table we were given was in the conservatory section  The table was dirty and they moved us to a new table  The new table was also dirty and the lady proceeded to spray the table whilst we were sitting there   Our waiter was dreadful  I have dined at many top restaurants and never have I received such a bad service  He took our order and served our food and poured 2 glasses of water and 2 glasses of prosecco  After that he never came near our table   We poured our own presecco after that   My sister had to lift a dripping bottle of presecco and poured our own drinks  He never once came to our table to see if we were ok   We told the gentleman who was over the section and he offered a free drink  Just to also say the food was tasty but was lukewarm  I didnt want to say anything about the food as I was so stressed over the experience and I didnt want to cause any more upset to my sister as I had brought her out for her birthday   On leaving we spoke with the Manager and he gave my sister his card   We spoke of our disappointment  He again offered us a drink downstairs but we declined and at this stage we just wanted to leave   It was a very disappointing experience and I just couldnt believe the service we received   It was very upsetting as I had brought my sister out for her birthday and to be honest our experience in your restaurant ruined the evening   I look forward to hearing from you 
R0065,Very disappointing  Nice venue / room but crowded  Food bland and dry and lacking in flavour  Crowded room  Gave feedback to manager re food and we didnt see him again  Wont be returning or recommending 
R0065,Very enjoyable for a Sunday lunch  Quiet enough to have a conversation but not so quiet that you feel you have to whisper 
R0065,Very happy and enjoyable experience offering excellent food service and ambience and is good value 
R0065,very long waiting times  really too noisy for a restaurant with medium high prices  average food even though the quality of the meat seemed good to me 
R0065,Very nice atmosphere and food was excellent  lovely added touch when they all came round the table to sing happy birthday 
R0065,"VERY NICE PLACE  EXCELENT FOOD 
OUTSTANDING SERVICE"
R0065,Very noisy   Service not great  Food ok coffee cold  Felt rushed from table
R0065,Very overrated and over priced  Fillet steak med rare was dry and was not tender  My wife had pork which came topped with smoked bacon which see cannot eat but was not stated on the menu  My friend had a sirloin which was overdone and chewy  Staff were made aware of our issues and gave us a glass of prosecco but did not compensate the dissatisfaction of our meal 
R0065,"Very unsatisfied with our experience on Sat last 
  Service was poor   
Our starters arrived pretty much as soon as we ordered and without our bottle of wine being served
  Food was ok but not to the standards it use to be 
Dessert couldnt be eaten   had ordered a cheesecake and it was obvious it had been out of the fridge for a number of hours   was warm and not edible  the manager did apologize for this and brought a fresh slice"
R0065,Very very impressed from meet and greet at the door to food  serving  staff  location and interior Will return with pleasure and would highly recommend it to anyone who has a fine taste for restaurants  This is not a pub for those looking to grab a Guinness  It is fine high class dinning 
R0065,Very welcoming  polite  great service and we felt like we got a service that was tailored to our needs   it was my Boyfriends birthday
R0065,"very well managed staff   i had a very poor seat next to there plates and cutlery were housed and delivered  
it was the worst seat in the house i would guess  lots of free seats so why put us there       "
R0065,Visited on a Tuesday evening  Undercooked food and overly sweet cocktails  Though the service was good  overall experience was bad 
R0065,Waited 30 mins for our table that had been booked in advance   Had to remind waiter we were waiting   Very poor service in that regard  
R0065,"Waited 30 mins with nobody approaching our table before we had to approach a manager to make a drinks order 

Food took 1 hour to arrive and was below average 

You would receive better service in McDonalds   "
R0065,Waiter was appallingly rude throughout the meal and we were charged for another tables bill on top of ours  When we pointed it out the waiter was condescending and did not apologise 
R0065,Waiter was very rude  Girlfriend ordered from the 3 course set menu  I ordered two courses that were not on that menu  no dessert  Got charged for 2 set menus  When I pointed this out to him  he told me that he asked if I wanted dessert and that I said no  That doesnt mean I should be charged for it  Especially since I didnt order off the set menu  He became rude at that stage  telling me that its only a couple of euro difference  and did I want a new bill  When I said yes  he snatched the bill out of my hand 
R0065,Waiting staff were inexperienced  didnt pay attention to my allergies  They didnt tell us what anything was when serving or what was removed for my benefit  The server had no idea what was gluten free and didnt offer to ask  My main course steak was burnt to a crisp and was fatty and inedible  I asked for a replacement which came 15 mins later and well done  I asked for medium to rare   They didnt charge me which was one good thing about the meal  Overall not impressed and wouldnt return 
R0065,Waitress never came to table to greet us or tell her name  Showed up 20 minutes later and asked for our order  Then we never saw her again  Busy waiting on another big table 
R0065,was a bit late but they fitted us in  first class place and service
R0065,Was there on 3rd Sept  Had a burger  and  chips  The burger was cold  the chips tasted like reheats and the service was mediocre at best  There are too many good burger places in Dublin to be putting up with this shite 
R0065,Was theres for my sons graduation  Drink ordered at bar arrived after starters  Coffee arrived before dessert  Overall sense that staff were not prepared for volume  Disappointing experience 
R0065,Was very pleasantly surprised    great quality food and pleasant service 
R0065,way overpriced  bad quality  MUCH better dining options basically anywhere else in the city 
R0065,We  have beautiful food staff were very welcoming and helpful Will definately be returning
R0065,We a great night out at  this restaurant with friends  The food was delicious and good value  The staff were very attentive but not intrusive  Very enjoyable
R0065,We absolutely loved this place  the staff are so friendly and welcoming  delicious cocktails pre dinner kick started a great evening  food was delicious as always  One of my favourite spots to dine in Dublin  I highly recommend it 
R0065,We always use this place for business but on this occasion we were a bit disappointed   the table we were seated at was on top of another table with a larger group and it crowded our table for 3 out   there was very little room for staff to get past and it made it uncomfortable   we should have asked to move when we were seated but didnt   There was no salt and pepper when meal arrived and we had to ask waiter for this   I forgot to order extra sides but the waiter didnt remind us when taking the order   
R0065,We are good customers of this restaurant over the years   Our meal on Wednesday was very disappointing and bad value for money
R0065,We arrived early and had a drink at the Bar and then moved to our Table with friends Everything was great 
R0065,We arrived early and whilst they welcomed this  they kept us waiting 20 minutes past our original booking time  Then they tried to cram us into a tiny corner where waiters would have to stretch over our heads to get to the table beside us  Food is just ok  very noisy setting and staff are friendly but its all too Celtic Tiger rush an nothing special sour it
R0065,We ate here a few nights earlier when visiting Dublin   This place was extraordinarily good in every respect  so had high hopes Everything was fine at first  but the server  who seemed relatively inexperienced  disappeared after taking our order  For the rest of our meal we never knew who was supposed to be taking care of our table  Different people dropped off food  brought water  refilled drinks  took dessert order  delivered dessert  brought coffee  Very disappointing 
R0065,"We booked a table for 5 for my brothers birthday and all got the set menu for  Euro 54 50  While we couldnt complain about the food  the service could have been much better  

The fire alarm  no pun intended  went on for a significant period of time and none of the staff seemed to know what to do or direct anyone whether to leave the restaurant or stay  

Also we had asked in advance for a candle in my brothers dessert and the waiter brought down the dessert with a candle that had not been lit and had to run off to find a lighter which defeated the purpose  

There should have been  tea/coffee included in the set menu  but we were never offered this either  For the prices we would have expected much better service and attention to detail "
R0065,We booked in as a large group and when I phoned to confirm the booking  specified that we needed to be on one table as we were there to celebrate a special occasion for a friend  When we arrived we were led to two separate tables which was less than ideal and that was the start of it all  The service was incredibly slow and when the food started coming out it came out in drips and drabs with people receiving meals as others were finishing  We had the set menu which was a conglomerate of random selections  Almost all of the party were disappointed with the mains  For example there is no excuse for small  dried out chicken or cold steak in this day and age  the room itself had no atmosphere but again maybe thats because our party was split up  I usually dont write reviews on these pages but we were so disappointed and relayed this to the team who did offer a glass of Prosecco in the bar downstairs to make up for it  I did have an element of sympathy for the staff as some were only trying to do their best with what they had  This has got to be one of the best locations in Dublin and  I assumed would be a lovely treat for a special day  I am just perplexed as to how they have it so wrong  I wish I did more research beforehand as we spent an awful lot of money on a less than average experience which is what we were hoping to avoid 
R0065,We found the steaks tender but quite salty  The accompanying salad was just leaves 
R0065,We got 3 different dishes  The prawns were tasty if small  but the pasta and hake were disappointing 
R0065,"We got a voucher and went  it was as our first time going  By far one of the tastiest meals I have ever had  Fantastic and ideal 

Would highly recommend for any occasion  worth the money 

Service is amazing 

Thanks to you all "
R0065,We got served pre made pestos  tasted chemical and we actually know the product  and a huge amount of frozen   lack of tasting   fries  Left the fries and ate the steak    Did a complaint with the Manager    food did not look good at all and over priced for what it is  This is a disappointment considering I visited here few times few years ago and first time back    really wont recommend this to anyone  Great steak but thats common in Ireland  If the experience is not the value we paid    then not worth it  HUGE problem in the Kitchen  the chef and kitchen should be ashamed to send these poor items to the table 
R0065,We had a brilliant night  It was expensive but worth every penny  The food was amazing staff were friendly  I couldnt ask for more 
R0065,"We had a lovely meal to celebrate  our daughters birthday at  this restaurant  
Food was excellent  Really lovely  restaurant   well worth a visit "
R0065,"We had a lovely meal to celebrate �our daughters birthday at this restaurant  
Food was excellent  Really lovely �restaurant   well worth a visit "
R0065,We had a very disappointing family birthday event  The table was booked for 9 p m   at the request of the restaurant  for seven people on Saturday  8 April 2017  After meeting for a drink in a local pub we went at 9 p m  where our name was taken and we were asked to wait  Over the next 50 minutes we inquired five times as to whether our table  booked for 9 p m   was ready yet  Five times we were told that this would be checked but no one ever returned to tell us the result of those checks  Eventually  we insisted on being brought to our table but it was well after 10 p m  before we could put in our order  at that stage we were all so hungry and upset at our treatment that it was impossible to retrieve the evening  and it was well after midnight that we paid  dearly  for our birthday meal  Because it was so late  we then had the added expense of three taxi fares rather than taking public transport home as planned 
R0065,We had a wonderful experience here and the food and service was exceptional
R0065,We had an amazing evening  Our waiter was excellent  Food fabulous  Never disappoints
R0065,We had an amazing time at the restaurant  couldnt fault anything 
R0065,We had food that was not cooked to the appropriate temperature  orders were incorrectly taken and the quality of the steaks were not good  We would not return 
R0065,"We had reserved a table for 9pm  We were left waiting in the launch bar for long time  around 30minutes  without anybody bothering telling us of bringing excuses for the delay 
Appalling service 

The least we would have deserved would have been someone to come apologize in the first instance  We had to ask the lady at reception twice  after 15 minutes and after half an hr  
This is unacceptable 

I would have expected a higher degree of professionalism in a place like this "
R0065,We had to wait for 20 minutes   which was probably done to get us to order drinks from the bar before dinner  food was average  undercooked   service was delayed  wrong bill was given to us and jacket misplaced  horrendous experience 
R0065,We have visited here a number of times over the past couple of years and found the experience and atmosphere very good  however  was very disappointed last Sunday  The restaurant was cold  the service was patchy and food although ok was not brilliant  Overall not a great experience and something they should do something about as there a lot of very good equally high end alternatives available when dining in Dublin now 
R0065,We loved the ambience it was a special occasion and a trip to Dublin from Scotland  Truly memorable  a restaurant we will never forget 
R0065,We ordered the filet and the prawns  Excellent  And the raspberry and honey smash cocktail was perfection 
R0065,We visited for Sunday lunch  Lovely meal in a lovely setting  Highly recommend 
R0065,We waited so long for waiter to ask us for dessert that we ended up skipping and leaving   Very disappointing as dessert was part of the 39 95 EUR 3 course meal we each bought 
R0065,We went for my mothers birthday on aug 4th  our table was booked through online app  on arrival we were left �waiting for a host� for about 5 mins  although we probably wouldnt have noticed bar the fact that we were told this about 10 times  took the apology and moved on  Our food and drinks order were taken at the same time  although the appetizer arrived before the drinks  about 20 mins after being ordered and the drinks were another 10 mins when we brought it to their attention  I slipped down to front desk and handed them my card  telling them that I wanted to pay for the meal when we were done  and the same manager we were greeted with called the servers and asked them to place a �no bill to the table� note on their system  After we finished dinner and drinks  I ran downstairs before anyone at the table had a chance to ask for the bill  and paid  By the time I got back to the table the cheque was on the table and the waitress was about to take my dads card for payment  For the time we got there we felt like the service was all over the place  Food was good but the mess ups and the service would make me not want to make another visit
R0065,"We were a bit disapointed with our night    Firstly my husbands meal was wrong  and then one of out guests had to give back his steak he found it very chewy  
It was a family get together   and some of the guests 1st time there   But would not go back"
R0065,"We were booked at 9:15 and didnt get table till 9:45  when were asked about water which never came and still get charged for it  service is shocking slow 
Food still very nice have to say  just not in weekend go near it maybe "
R0065,"We were craving burgers and decided to give this place a try  It was pretty busy for a Tuesday evening so we had to wait 10 15mins  Once we got to our table we waited almost another 10mins by the time our server came by so by that point we had our food orders ready at the same time as the initial drink order  

We ordered 4 meals; the mushroom burger  the cheeseburger  the big smoke and the kids penne bolognese with salads  cheesy garlic bread and baked potatoes for the sides  The burgers are huge and tasty however there were pieces of small bones found in the mushroom burger  not just one but a few small pieces   As soon as we told our server she got the manager and they took it away and apologized profusely  We ordered the ribs in place of the mushroom burger just to be safe and it came out quickly and was tasty  

They didnt charge for the mushroom burger but did charge full price for the ribs and the rest of the meals  no discount   We arent originally from Ireland so not sure how restaurants normally work but usually in Canada they give you some sort of a discount or else give the replacement meal for free because of the inconvenience  

Overall this place is just ok  They dealt with the situation well but the rest of experience and food wasnt enough to wow us to return "
R0065,We were here for the Christmas dinner menu  2 vegetarians enjoyed starters but the option  a very weak cannelloni swimming in sauce was not up to the standard the the meat dishes were  Service was extremely slow  About 4 hours spent in the restaurant which is just too long  even with the busy period  Had to ask for change about 30 mins after paying  Would still try again if it was a normal menu 
R0065,We were really looking forward to dining  location is perfect  Got seated at a table on the main floor  ordered starters  came and were enjoyed  ordered a  Euro 56 bottle of Reserve Rioja which after the first pour I had to pour for both of us  same as waters  ordered a Sirloin for mains  was without a fork for over 3 mins before my partner alerted a server  my main course plate was not served on a hot plate and nobody checked at anytime through our dining experience were we ok or did we need anything  Finally we finished with coffees and a dessert and presented with our bill of  Euro 150  On leaving we were walked to the door and I had to retrieve my coat  I asked a server and his reply was � help yourself�  so it was my job to search through 200 coats to find ours  Having spent over 20 years and continue to do so  this experience was not expected from such a fine venue  This was a talking point for the rest of what was supposed to be a special occasion  All of the above should be standard for anyone working in hospitality in my eyes 
R0065,We were requested to gulp our dinner in two hours  The service was crap  The food was delicious  This is my fourth time in here but the worst experience given that I had very special guests this time  I would not recommend this venue for the weekend  Regrettably  nothing will be done with this review anyway 
R0065,We were sat in the small front room upstairs with three other tables    noise levels were almost unbearable from the other tables   Server accidentally rang our whole bill through twice
R0065,We were very surprised when the bill arrived Very expensive and not worth it The service was bad We had to ask to order wine and constantly asking for more water We will not be returning 
R0065,"We were visiting Dublin on a Christmas shopping trip and were really disappointed by the food  service  price and noise level in this restaurant 
The music was so loud we could not hear each other  The serving staff did not understand the menu 
The prawn starter was like rubber  The main course was late and was cold when we received it 
As well as being cold the food was bland and tasteless 

A really poor experience all around"
R0065,"Weve been waiting during almost 1 hour and an half for our table 
The waiting area was nice but it was way too late to sit nearly at 11PM 
The beef was great but bearnaise and skinny fries really not good 
A bit expensive so"
R0065,Weve been here a few times now  and usually really like it  But our main course wasnt great unfortunately this time round  We both ordered fillet steaks medium  They were over cooked and dry  And the mash was really stodgy  For the money you pay  it has really put us off going back  Shame  as we really enjoyed it before 
R0065,Weve visited before on trips to Ireland  Service was terrible  3 hrs 30min for a dinner   Service was really bad   wont be back
R0065,"Well received upon arrival and waited to be seated at our table  When table was ready we were asked to follow member of staff to our table  We had to carry our drinks from the bar and as we had some young children this was a little more difficult than normal  Staff member looked on as we struggled somewhat without offering any assistance  
I remember thinking a little help would have been appreciated 
We ordered starter and main course and both dishes arrived very promptly  However as we were eating the restaurant started to fill up as it was 23rd December  When we finished our main course it soon begin apparent we were invisible  We waited well over half an hour to have our plates removed  At that stage our children were fed up and we decided to skip dessert  The bill arrived and as was Christmas menu a premium was charged on the menu due to time of year  I dont mind paying such premium at Christmas but only when service is at a high level and in this case it fell well short  I would be an occasional customer and think it is fine venue for occasions but I will think twice in future after this experience "
R0065,"Went for Christmas dinner with my girlfriend  I try to pick somewhere special every year and was hoping this would be the perfect spot  Had heard good things from friends  Would very disappointed 

They were 45minutes delayed bringing us to our table  Christmas is busy yes  but that is unacceptable  They said we were �next� when I asked after 10minute delay but took more than another half hour 

Waitress once we sat at our table was pleasant and prompt: 3 courses in an hour  However took another half hour after our table was cleared before they eventually brought the bill  

Extremely noisy throughout dinner and drinks before  Difficult to have a conversation  Multiple large group parties  

 Euro 55 set menu per person + wine + service = not worth it "
R0065,Went for my birthday  Food  wine and service were all excellent  I had a wonderful evening 
R0065,Went for Sunday lunch with the family  Staff could not have been nicer and the food was great  Definitely recommend
R0065,Went for the first time on Wednesday with a date The food was amazing the staff were very attentive and the decor inside was really nice We had a three course meal each and a couple of drinks the price was reasonable Overall I am very happy to have tried this restaurant and I would highly recommend it to anyone 
R0065,Went for the tomahalk steak  loved it
R0065,Went to this place for my graduation dinner  The staff were amazing and the food was divine  I highly reccomend 
R0065,What stood out for my in my experience was the staff  soo well trained  very professional and friendly  i thoroughly enjoyed my dinner
R0065,Where to start the waiters were all over the place bringing wrong food to tables and having to wait approx 30 mins to give our order  Me and my girlfriend both ordered steaks which both off us had said there was absolutely no taste at all the peppercorn sauce was the same no flavour at all from it  The chips were not cooked and were still hard  We were also waiting a long time to be served our drinks  I would say this is the most overrated restaurant in dublin for what you pay for a meal its not worth at all specially with marco pierre whites restaurant across the road i would certainly not recommend this restaurant and will be telling my company that they should stop bringing customers here for a meal 
R0065,"While I cant fault the service as our waitress was lovely the overall experience was very disappointing 

The set menu at 54 euro per person had a number of supplement charges  one being a fiver supplement for a cheeseboard  as well as 2 euro supplements for tea/coffee  We were brought out water which we found out at the end was a 4 euro a bottle   its very frustrating when customers are offered water but its not specified that theyll be charged for it  Unless its specified they shouldnt be charged 

We ordered the steak which was mediocre at best  Considering the price we were paying we expected a lot more  It was also cold when it was brought out  The sides at 6 euro extra were disappointing  

We were seated next to the host stand so found it awkward to have a proper conversation as we could see and hear everything the staff were doing as they were congregated there  

Overall its not value for money  Id go as far as to say its actually a bit of a rip off  While the service was nice it doesnt make up for the fact that its a mediocre food  an ok experience and very overpriced  Would not recommend or return "
R0065,While the food was good  the menu was quite restrictive  The ambiance was noisy  and  the restaurant was too big  very disappointing 
R0065,Without doubt some of the best food and service ever received 10/10
R0065,Wonderful cocktails  lovely staff  and the food did not disappoint 
R0065,Wonderful evening on the balcony in beautiful weather
R0065,Wonderful evening with great staff and hospitality  Provided my girlfriend with a great birthday experience 
R0065,Wonderful food and drink  Great atmosphere  Staff were very pleasent and helpful
R0065,Wonderful night   treated like royalty beautiful food and ambience  cant wait to go again 
R0065,Wonderful place for a special occasion meal  The service was impeccable and our group had a wonderful meal 
R0065,Wonderful venue  complete surprise  Food was excellent  Service was very good  10 people dining  Not rushed  Brilliant atmosphere 
R0065,Wonderful visit  on a friends recommendation  Food  service and atmosphere were outstanding 
R0065,Worst dining experience in a long time  From the rude welcome on entering the place  to the poor service  Overall not satisfied
R0065,The food was mediocre and bland  For the price paid it was insulting to be served those meals  My advice  avoid this place unless you want to throw away money and leave dissatisfied 
R0065,Would definitely return  had a great meal and the cocktails in he bar afterwards were amazing
R0065,Yes I would recommend it   I would only comment that we had to wait 30 minutes for our table  I appreciate it was Mothers day  so it meant we didnt get our table until 17 30 which meant we werent sure if we could order the roast   We asked a waiter when we sat down however they never came back so we ordered of the normal menu
R0065,"You get a v strong on reception when you arrive  I think it smells like someone has been sick  I spotted the meat fridge      
Lovely welcome  fab starter  menu is great but main course  turkey roulade was dry and the cabbage/sprouts  were over cooked 
Service was slow  our lunch took two hours and then my guests jacket was misplaced 
 
Not the usual standard I know you were busy with large groups but sometimes the small tables are your regulars  "
R0066, tasty food   great service but the main course consisted of 3 scallops and chips was  Euro 20
R0066,"A bit disappointed 
Starter over cooked 
Not as good as Sandycove 
Staff very nice but food only average"
R0066,Amazing food I would recommend the platter for two for one   
R0066,"Avoid like the plague  Waited over an hour for food to be delivered  We live about 5 mins away by car  Food arrived cold and also missing a childs meal which was paid for  Rang to complain  told it would be another half hour to wait for the rest of it  We cancelled the order asked them to pick up the food and refund the money  2 hours later and three phone calls later still no sign of the refund 
Im sure the food is nice  When not cold and missing 
Customer service is the worst for a franchise "
R0066,Could use some work  I got the falafel burger but it was really just 3 falafel patties stuffed into a bun  I wish it would have been one large burger sized patty so they didnt all fall out as I was eating them  The burger didnt come with fries  which I thought would be a staple   I also got a small simple green salad  I was impressed by the flavor of the dressing and roasted cumin on it however the avocado was so hard that it was inedible  I couldnt cut it with a fork or knife so I just had to leave it on the plate  Why would you even serve avocado that wasnt ripe  I also got the greek honey and yogurt dessert which was the best thing about the meal   but unfortunately it was packaged and was not actually made by the restaurant  The service was excellent  menu was great  but unfortunately the food was lacking 
R0066,Everything was good
R0066,Great fresh fish and seafood reasonably priced   Really good fish and chips 
R0066,Great restaurant and great food  Staff are always very nice and helpful  Great food for good prices  I will defenitely come back 
R0066,It was a really nice dinning experience  Already recommended to our friends  Everything was so nice 
R0066,Modest but varied menu  reasonable prices in a pleasant environment and as mentioned above delicious food  A real treat 
R0066,Poor customer service  Asked for another table and was given a poor response  Waited 40 minutes for another table  When we ordered our food  we waited almost an hour for our wings and the table of 6 who came in 30 minutes after us received theirs before ours  Ordered a portion of chicken wings for takeaway and when I asked for a carrier bag  conveniently they ran out of them just as I asked for one  Overall poor customer service and I do not recommend this place as they did not make us feel welcomed and made us feel awkward being in their restaurant 
R0066,Superb   Food was the nicest I have ever had  Staff were very pleasant  We will definitely be back
R0066,The cheesecake wasnt as creamy as Im used to and the brownie was much over done 
R0066,top class all round  very enjoyable    really good food  setting  and  service   off the beaten track  Nice area for a pre drink  lovely atmosphere
R0066,Very central great food friendly staff and good value
R0066,Very disappointing meal  We had shrimp nachos which were covered in a weird cold white sauce  No shrimps to be seen  Black sole on the special board was like rubber and appeared to have been cooked earlier that day 
R0066,Very friendly staff   Good was trying hard but didnt quite make it    Grilled sole was very good 
R0066,We were in the same restaurant last month and the food was amazing  Very fresh  Because of the good experience we decided to try out the  restaurant again but it was awful  pre cooked food arrived in less than 3 minutes after we ordered and it tasted bad  Would not recommend  to anyone
R0066,What a fantastic find  This place is quite small  so I would recommend booking a table  I came here for lunch with a friend  We had the sharing platter for 2 for just  Euro 19 50  What fantastic value for money  The best calamari I have ever tasted  along with small crab sandwiches  prawns and brilliant mussels  I would highly recommend this place  And brilliant location in Temple Bar
R0067, Hubby had pancakes with bacon  Pancakes were awesome and bacon was good 
R0067," I went there with friends a couple of months ago and spent a good time 
We ordered so many meals and I remember them to be good  I ordered a steak as a main dish and it was delicious  my friends had the tuna  2 of them got sick on the same night  not sure if its from the Tuna though or something else   
I had a good time nd would recommend it  The waiters were super friendly "
R0067,A great place to get pizza out of town  Really delicious and authentic wood stove pizza  Its been newly renovated
R0067,A really enjoyable meal   a varied and enticing menu  beautiful grilled fish  mussels etc and very tasty desserts 
R0067,Absolutely fabulous meal  Staff were extremely helpful and kind  and ambiance was perfect

R0067,Great location  food and staff  Very child friendly
R0067,I had one of the most fabulous vegetarian breakfast here ever   what a wonderful place  � �If only I lived nearby I would be there all the time
R0067,I regularly come here and have been a regular now for years but the service really ruined our night out  One main course was completely forgotten we asked for it 3 times and it still didnt arrive  We eventually cancelled it as it took over and hour and we shared our food with the person left without a main  A round of drinks was also forgotten about  Again we asked for it 3 times  With such poor service I would hesitate on going again  This is now the second time this has happened  I went Thurs morning for breakfast which was beautiful as always and great service  Its a pity service  so bad  Im a chef and can honestly say they cook the fish to perfection but poor service is so frustrating  Its a pity 
R0067,I wouldnt rush back and I do hope our visitors enjoy better  more varied fare  elsewhere in our fair city 
R0067,Lovely food and lovely night out  Food was great and so was the service  Would highly recommend 
R0067,Lovely food with very attentive staff and cosy atmosphere 
R0067,"My food arrived  and the ""roast vegetable wrap"" had raw spinach  shredded carrots and green bell peppers  Not a roasted veg in sight "
R0067,Nice cozy restaurant with lovely staff  although I have to say slightly overpriced for what you get in my opinion 
R0067,Nice staff and great food  Fair prices  Will come again  Pizza was very thin and crispy 
R0067,Not an enjoyable experience  Very disappointed and wont be back 
R0067,Pizza was delish  thin crispy base and hit the spot  Margherita with olives artichokes and pepperoni Generous portions  friendly staff 
R0067,Really tasty food and great service  with a sea view 
R0067,"Simply World class seafood 
Best in Dublin"
R0067,Stew and stuffed chicken were very tasty   The high ratings is was steered us to this pub   Was not disappointed 
R0067,This was our last dinner in Dublin and Im very disappointed 
R0067,Very busy upstairs and too few waiting staff   Was waiting for food  some sides never arrived and had to order some drinks 3 times before they arrived   Very noisy and hard to hear description of dishes by waiting staff  Tables and seating very tight  Food was delicious but service very poor 
R0067,"We had dinner there on the last night of a two week vacation in Ireland   It was a great way to end the trip with some awesome seafood and quality drinks   We also shared a dessert and an after dinner drink and both were excellent 

We would highly recommend for an enjoyable dinner "
R0067,Went here a while back but had an amazing night  great food  great service and even got serenaded  Would highly recommend 
R0067,Best pizza my wife and son have ever had 
R0068,A family 3 day break in Dublin  The reviews were quite good so I decided to book a table for the four of us  We were very disappointed by the food  It was tasteless and pricey  If I come back to Dublin  I will chhose another restaurant 
R0068,Always a good place to eat with very well made food and a nice atmosphere and lovely servers 
R0068,Amazing Restaurant  Great food and drink would recommend to anyone visiting Dublin  Left truly satisfied after finding this amazing restaurant 
R0068,Awful  half the items on the menu missing at 7pm on a Saturday evening  Steak was cheap cut and grizzle  Chips had a funny after taste like the fat needed changing  chips mushrooms and onions all tasted the same  Bright beaming lights so no ambience or atmosphere like displayed in the images  more of an over rated American diner design more on par with the fast food chain next door then nice Irish family restaurant  Terrible rude service  Far better places to spend your money in the local area  shame we wasted ours 
R0068,Fab atmosphere and fab food loved the comfy sofas to sit on and service was very good  A good choice if you want a typical Irish meal 
R0068,Food was good but presentation could be better to much food on plate need service vegetables separate
R0068,Good location  good portions  good geeeting  good service  good value 
R0068,Great food  arrived promptly  Brilliant service 
R0068,I booked this reservation for my birthday and the service was terrible   It took 20mins to get a glass of water    we had to ask for things like ketchup an average of three times before the finally bring it to us   Then the waiters gave us dirty looks because we had the audacity to ask   I ate here three years ago and loved it so much that I wanted to have a special dinner there   What can I say     mistakes were made  Never again
R0068,I had seen really good reviews about this place and was really disappointed by the poor quality of the food  Tasted like salt really  The staff are pretty friendly though  Could only return for a quiet coffee or craft beer 
R0068,if youre hungry you should try the mixed grill  Great restaurant
R0068,"It was a most enjoyable meal 
We were looked after well
Very good value 
Will return"
R0068,It was excellent as usual  It offers a wide variety of options for coeliacs  and other allergens are also well indicated in the menu 
R0068,Its a nice big pub  Serves good food  reasonably priced with good service  Its right beside Dart station  Youll have no trouble getting a seat as its usually very quiet 
R0068,Its a nice place in the city centre to have a delicious brunch  Avocado eggs and Mushrooms toast are excelent 
R0068,Lovely food  quick service and good atmosphere  Really enjoyed it
R0068,Lovely restaurant with good choice of menu   Staff were excellent and very accommodating 
R0068,Not according to the expectations from other reviews 
R0068,Not somewhere Ill be back to  Pub grub not a restraunt 
R0068,"Ordered the pesto chicken pasta which was bland and tasteless and chicken was dry  Very disappointing 
Partner had goats cheese burger and chips which he was not impressed with 
We visited on new years eve which was very busy you could see the restaurant had took too many bookings and staff werent organised for it at all  Partners food order was taken incorrectly  Poor service and rushed  Would not recommend or be visiting again  Waste of money  Would prefer going to McDonalds than going here "
R0068,The food was a very mixed bag   The Irish stew was watery and the meat in it was tough   The seafood chowder was decent as were the chicken wings   The mushroom appetizer was very tasty    Prices were too high for the quality of food   Our server was inattentive in more ways than one   After taking our order his job was complete; others brought our food to us  which is fine except that he didnt check back to see if we needed more drinks or anything   I rarely write negative reviews   normally I make good choices regarding restaurants   This time I made a mistake 
R0068,"The food was not outstanding but average 
It was very crowded en there were people waiting for a place to be seated  This is where the manager did not know how to guide his personell  None if the waiters knew exactly what their job was    pitty"
R0068,Their early bird is until 7 30 which is great  I loved every minute and bites I had there  really good food and friendly and approable staff 
R0068,They get one star back for the way they handled the incident  comping the appetizers  offering a free round of drinks and profusely apologizing  not our waitress  other servers   which is the best they could do given the circumstance 
R0068,"Waitresses try their best  they are attentive and smiley  unfortunately food disappointed us very much  
I really expect to have Irish stew in Irish restaurant look and taste like a stew and not like a watery broth with carrots "
R0068,Warming and comfy setting with attentive service and excellent food  �I had the short rib and it was great  �And a very nice Amarone  amongst other nice wines  by the glass  �Definitely recommend this location 
R0068,Wasnt happy with the food the worse part they didnt have what I wanted
R0068,We were a party of 8  Wasnt happy to find service charge of 15 percent automatically added to the bill if you were party of 8 or more  We always tip but feel annoyed when an automatic service charge is added rather than at our discretion  To make things worse 2 of our meals were very poor  The Irish stew had awful fatty lamb and another meal was dry salmon and cold potatoes and veg which must have been microwaved  Our other dishes were ok and they did deduct one meal value but wasnt the best dining experience
R0068,Went in the evening to grab a coffee I got a rum and coke instead  You can get two of those for 10 euro or one for 7 euro  Was well made and strong on the run  just the way I like it  My friend ordered some food  and she said it was quite good as well  I would go back again for another drink   
R0068,While I cant fault the food or friendliness of the staff  the service myself and my partner experienced on a hectic occasion such as Valentines Day was not up to scratch  We waited almost 30 minutes for our meal to be served and were overcharged with the wrong bill  twice  Dont get me wrong  its still a good restaurant but can be frustrating when going at a busy period 
R0068,Worst experience in a restaurant ever  We went to the restaurant last year and had a wonderful time  We look forward to it every year  This year it was horrendous  We booked a table for 6 people and were given a table for 5  One of guests was twelve and asked for a childs menu  This was greeted with multiple questions from the waiter about her age and then reciprocated by the manager  We all then ordered and waited 40 minutes for our meals  Every single one was extremely below standard  The roast chicken was boiled and full of oil  The pizza was completely covered in oregano and the turkey and ham was below standard  We were not asked which additional options to these meals we would like and instead all given chips  All these meals were extremely disappointing and not worth the money we spent  The choice was limited to the christmas menu or al carte  which is so unusual for a restaurant  Staff also so rude and made all of us feel unwanted  uncomfortable and just there for income  Definitely will not be returning 
R0069,I had booked the early bird sitting but the menu was a special pre concert menu   The bruchetta was very expensive and a bit bland   The minestrone soup was also quite bland   Overall average 
R0069,I had made an reservation for new years eve then was left waiting for nearly half hour standing outside the restaurant  host was rude with terrible customer service  Drinking water was dirty  When my meal had arrived  my potatoes were cold   I mentioned this to the waitress  it was just reheated making my chicken dry  My sisters salmon was overcooked    Overall expensive for reheated food   A home cooked meal wouldve suffice 
R0070,Brought a Chicago based friend and his significant Chicago other here for brunch and they were utterly blown away   oh how Dublin has changed one quipped  Not least because of the vegan options but also the dog friendliness  Had an amazing lunch of beans cooked in a rich tomato sauce with Pulled pork and fried egg  So delicious  Cant wait to return and bring Himself
R0070,Have been going here for well over 10 years now and never disappointed  Love everything about this place 
R0070,I dont normally leave reviews but I felt this place deserved the effort Great staff  and  tasty fresh seasonal food  Its rater small restaurant and filled up quickly so book a table to avoid disappointment 
R0070,I LOVE this place  The coffee is fantastic and the food is fresh and delicious  It was so good that I ate here every day of my vacation 
R0070,Loved this place  Fantastic food  Great service  Value for money  This place serves authentic food and has great service
R0070,The food was hot and delicious  The servers were fabulous 
R0070,The very friendly waitress reassured us that though the menu seems complex first time round  after youve done it once  its a breeze   Thats how I cottoned on to the fact that the wait staff here have post docs in maths  
R0071,Beautiful place to have a Meal great service Hostesses were very very  polite and respectful  
R0071,Food was excellent as usual and the staff are so friendly and helpful 
R0071,Great and tasty food lovely decor attentive staff 
R0071,Lovely food and service enjoyable evening 
R0071,"My starter of chicken wings were massively encrusted with a bland substance  The wing sauce was sickly sweet with no real flavor 
My main seemed exoctic on the menu but was bland for a finish 
My partners starter was 3 thin strips of chicken with minimal garnish  She described her main as �ok� with the sauce being the savings of the dish 
In all  the food was more associated with a poor takeaway with  Euro 7 dishs than a place to impress a date 
There was no value in the evening and I would not go there again 
The staff and the facility/service were excellent 
The rule for property is �location  location  location  It seems this establishment is surviving based on the same logic 
I wish them well  "
R0072, Euro 9 90 lunch deal for two courses        love it    its simple and cute    very basic enough food   pizzas  pastas      service isnt the quickest though  if your in a rush           
R0072,As a health conscious fitness professional   this funky middle eastern restaurant ticks all the right boxes for me   its terrific 
R0072,As for now   the best pizza in the area  Delicious 3 Fridays in a row  Highly recommend this place 
R0072,"Ate here on a Sunday morning so was eating from the brunch menu  Based on reviews I was looking forward to it  I had only heard people talk about one item from the brunch menu; the chicken pancakes  The experience was tainted from the start with one of the most obnoxious waiters Ive encountered   When asked if they had orange juice  a request I would deem reasonable in somewhere claiming to serve brunch  I was met with a snarky no  When asked whether it was possible to have poached eggs rather than fried eggs  an even snarkier no and some kind of comment a school teacher would give regarding the improper use of the word ""can""  He also forgot our coffee orders not once but twice  leaving us to abandon the second coffee and attempt to pay the bill  When he realised we hadnt left a tip  the service spoke for itself as to why there was no tip  he all but through the receipt at me  Apart from the woeful service  the food was itself bog standard  Nothing to write home about and certainly hyped by the boom "
R0072,Beautiful food  good atmosphere will definitely visit again  Hummus was so good and grilled chicken was beautiful   would really recommend this place
R0072,Came here for lunch one time and didnt forget it  Brilliant little place  Very busy because its simply delicious  Had a soup and sandwich and wasnt disappointed   Great choice for vegetarians and not the same old same old on the menu  
R0072,Excellent food and service  Wanted everything on the menu so looking forward to a return visit 
R0072,Excellent food  friendly staff    Recommended
R0072,Excellent fresh food   friendly service and I would definitely come back
R0072,"Firstly the service was appalling   Hard to get served   Huge wait   No politeness   

My pancake ""stack"" was two pancakes with a pat of butter   Miserable   

Place is nice   A bit loud due to hard surfaces   

Must  Try  Harder     Wont  Be   Back "
R0072,For the most part   decidedly below average  To be honest I was not looking for fine dining  but the coleslaw was essentially just a lump of mayonnaise with cabbage and carrot bits 
R0072,"Great burger and fries is amazing  Friendly staff  
Perhaps do better in cleaning the restrooms 
Price is a little bit too much"
R0072,Had high hopes considering the reviews and the amazing looking menu  and not that low of prices   My husband got the meat tasting menu and I got the seafood one  Honestly  the best parts were the sides  fried noodles  salad  steamed veggies   The shrimp was so mushy and overcooked that it took me a moment to figure out that it was even shrimp  The fish had absolutely zero flavor    Im not even sure how its possible to suck 100 percent of the flavor out  
R0072,I had been really looking forward to trying this place but found the food disappointing overall  My pork tonkatsu was very fatty  It is served in 3 finger sandwiches  one of which was almost entirely breaded fat  My friend also tasted it and didnt like it  Her duck buns however seemed to be a winner  I wished I had ordered them  We also shared but didnt finish a portion of the dumplings which were bland and not enjoyable at all  Though very nice  our server forgot a coffee on the order and didnt check in to see how the food was or ask why we didnt finish the dumplings  Sadly it was underwhelming overall 
R0072,I had the vegan pizza Was surprised to see on the menu that the superfood salad wasnt vegan  Also disappointed to hear that they didnt have non dairy milk for coffee 
R0072,I walked in with my groupon voucher and the waitress wasnt particularly friendly  Thats the least a customer expect 
R0072,"I was so excited to try the new pizza place in our neighbourhood and was so disappointed when I didnt enjoy it  

I just dont think the emmenthal is anywhere near as delicious as mozzarella  Its really chewy and goes hard really quickly as the pizza cools  Waaaaah  �I really wanted to love this place but unfortunately the pizza just aint for me "
R0072,"Ive been here on 3 occasions: a birthday party  lunch  and mid week dinner  By far my favourite was the lunch  It gets very busy here at night  almost too busy  and the tapas offering in the evening was perfectly tasty but I wasnt feeling it was particularly great value 

Its a great building  especially the green house in the back  Ive been to a few events there and its a brilliant venue 
Lunch was my favourite of the times I was here  The different rooms make for very comfortable surroundings and the salads and sandwiches on the menu were so tasty and great sized portions for the price  Which is why the evening tapas fell down in comparison in my opinion 
I can see myself returning on occasion  as theres so much to discover  Its designed and finished really well  but I feel like its a venue still finding its feet "
R0072,"Toasted and hard tortilla  disgusting meat  old lettuce etc and their hottest sauce was about as hot as ketchup  I couldnt finish it and might as well have got a burrito from centra or somewhere 

Avoid "
R0072,Incredible value for money for a tasty steak and very modern gastro side dishes  Oddly enough they do not have WiFi for guests  just a heads up 
R0072,It is a classy  sassy place  Its everything that a city restaurant should be: great ingredients  delicious food  nice ambiance at affordable prices  Highly recommended 
R0072,"Just great 
Very nice Service with perfect recomendings for food  Unexpected menue written  with appitising look on the plate  All the best for you and your Team "
R0072,Left a little disappointed as I expected more  Brought the family along and found the food was tasteless and uninspired  The biggest let down was the portion sizes  very miniscule  especially considering its only the first week of business 
R0072,Lovely food  nicely presented  Coffee was 3fe and lovely  Nice  interesting selection of dishes 
R0072,Lovely service and excellent food  Will happily return 
R0072,My advice to anyone going  expect to pay ridiculous prices for very basic and boring food  
R0072,"Nice set up and design of the cafe  

The staff seemed under pressure with the lunch crowd  running around the place trying to show people to there table  take orders and manage the till at the front door   I would guess that there was a team member or general host missing  

Food was nice  pork sandwich was very fatty so we had to trim the fat off   Others found Duck a bit bland and pancakes with chicken was lovely 

Would be good if they told you had to pay at the till rather than waiting at our table trying to catch someones eye to ask for the bill "
R0072,Poor offering from new restaurant  Service was slow and at times  rude  Food was disappointing  I had the soft scramble  It was only half warm and the proportions of the food were unbalanced  Twelve euro for eggs on toast is extortionate 
R0072,Portions of mussels served for the price was very bad value  Lamb burger very small portion and dry 
R0072,Really interesting and tasty food  Lovely staff and atmosphere  Will definitely be back 
R0072,Really Lovely Variety  Tonkatsu Sandwich was a winner 
R0072,Stopped here for lunch  �Had the three dish lunch got 10 euros  �Was great  �Service quick  tasty food  salad  liver pate and Mexican nachos  �Would recommend 
R0072,The Carrot and Tofu dish is an excellent starter and the gnocchi is beautifully cooked
R0072,"The spot has great coffee and a nice aesthetic  The staff are friendly but distant  so you will need to pipe up when you want a menu or a top up  

There is a good mix of options on the menu  but it will not cater to those who want the standard ketchup  they serve their own creation  which is not similar  or maple syrup  they serve orchard/apple syrup exclusively   

The service was quite slow  coffee orders were consistently wrong and some orders just didnt show  Staff were nice and apologised  but it did taint the overall experience  

I would definitely go back for a coffee/croissant in the morning  But I wouldnt recommend it as a brunch spot for the gang to get together as yet  It may be just some teething problems "
R0072,The tonkatsu sandwich was tough  chewy  lacking in texture  low on kewpie and most disappointing  lesson learned: very few places can get that right   but I am told their barley bowl is great so I will go back and give it another shot 
R0072,They do a Thai green curry   Welcome too a real Thai curry my little bit of paradise in the heart of Ireland
R0072,Thoroughly enjoyable night in a great space  serving pretty delicious food 
R0072,Unfortunately our server was repeatedly rude to our table  and we also waited an hour for our coffees  Not acceptable  Big let down 
R0072,Was in Dublin for business  starving for a good Pasta e Pizza  stop for a quick lunch at this restaurant        � Decor with out any character  simple but gentle service  Pasta and Pizza horrible  the pasta was overcooked and with out any flavor  �Pizza was the worst i had on my life 
R0072,We had the chicken wings  that was good and came in a big portion; and I had a chicken fillet with lots of salad  It was alright  Drinks: expensive  Only a few beer options and plenty of cocktails  The service was Ok but yeah  I had go with this place I wasnt impressed at all 
R0072,"We had the three small plates to share and chicken with pancakes and duck bao bun for main  
None of the small plates were good  The cheese ball was cold in the centre  the salmon was over cured  over salted  cut way too thick and flavourless  the dumpling tasted of artificial smoke and was way too salty  
The waitress asked if we enjoyed the starter  We said no so she just took the plates away with only one of each item eaten 
The main were in the same vein  Over salted  artificial tasting sauces  All very mediocre  We did not finish the mains either  
Service was poor and slow 
Needless to say  we wont be returning "
R0072,We had the wine  and  nibbles  Although tasty  they were quite expensive for the portion sizes 
R0072,We were so excited to see a new restaurant open just around the corner from our office so a few of us went on Friday lunchtime  The decor was lovely and the staff were pleasant but I am afraid that was where it stopped    The menu on paper looked a bit strange but everyone was open to try    When the food came though it was not well presented  most dishes came alone on a stark white plate  and did not taste great  The portions were also incredible small and we left hungry  When we got back to the office everyone was keen to hear how it was and am afraid we had to tell them not to waste their time trying it as it was so disappointing 
R0073,Absolutely fabulous steaks  perfectly done to your likings  Very competent staff  great wine selection 
R0073,Always super food and service in a quaint  and  relaxed setting
R0073,Amazing food and great service  10 out of 10  Would highly recommend it 
R0073,Amazing food and the waiting staff were extremely attentive  could not do enough for us but were not intrusive  It is a wonderful addition to Dublin and we would highly recommend it and will be back on a regular basis 
R0073,Beautiful food and fantastic service  probably my favourite Italian in Dublin now 
R0073,Delicious food coupled with excellent service
R0073,"Excellent food and wine and great service  
Lovely setting "
R0073,"Excellent food  handsome bar guy  I will definitely come back  because of the food  
  
  
And the guy"
R0073,Excellent food  Probably the best weve had since visiting Ireland  Highly recommended
R0073,"Food is incredible and the staff are absolutely welcoming and friendly  

Short waiting time for the food "
R0073,Food was delicious but service was subpar  Thankfully the support service staff was there to step in when our primary server was nowhere to be found  Drinks were very unique and delicious 
R0073,Great lasagna  Their potato and leek soup was also delicious  Great coffee and service  They have a fridge of ready made meals if you need something quick 
R0073,Had a fantastic lunch here on a Sunday  staff are so friendly and charming and the food is just fantastic  Could not recommend it more 
R0073,Had a lovely night with friends  Staff were v friendly  Food was great  I will be back
R0073,Loved it  great food n wine n excellent service  Really liked that our table for 2 wasnt next to another table for 2 as its a tight restaurant  Cant wait to go back
R0073,Lovely meal and great atmosphere in the restaurant 
R0073,One of the finest place to try veg food  One of the busiest place but for vegetarian best place  However only for and eating veg food are seen 
R0073,Perfect steak  served with vegetables and the staff was super  We got a groupon voucher with an amazing cost  Recomended with discount or  full price
R0073,Really great experience  pasta was perfectly cooked  waiters were so nice and attentive and the atmosphere was great   Will definitely be back
R0073,Staff are extremely friendly and helpful   Food is delicious   bubble tea is obviously 5 stars from me; �Feels like home  
R0073,The best pasta in Dublin  Most authentic experience outside of Italy  So  so tasty  Service is also fabulous 
R0073,The meal was delicious  I will be back with friends 
R0073,This is the best bar in Dublin  Great bartenders great whiskeys great food  Dont miss this great bar in the heart of Dublins exclusive midtown 
R0073,Very poor gluten free options with no gluten free pasta   In addition when ordering a starter meat and cheese board which the menu clearly stated was coeliac adaptable there was no gluten free bread or crackers available     Overall I thought poor value for money with very small portions  Seating was cramped with tables squeezed together  I got to hear more of the conversation from the table beside me then from my dining companions  Disappointing experience from such an experienced restauranteur 
R0073,We had a great night  The staff were so lovely and the food was delicious  Would highly recommend 
R0073,We were blown away by the experience  It was a fantastic experience  and will definitely go again 
R0073,Wonderful surprise in Dublin  Great fixed price lunch menu  �Great wine pours and wine paring knowledge 
R0074,"Absolutely amazing meal  I was the best meal that Ive ever had  The presentation and service was immaculate and flawless 
 "
R0074,Beautiful venue  Really nice staff  friendly  efficient  helpful etc   Food delicious  Thank you 
R0074,Chewing gum stuck under table only one server for whole room not even a glass of water received even though requested twice half hour later we cancelled drink order when mentioned to manager he argued with my husband never setting foot in place again  and  would never recommend to anyone
R0074,"Definitely come for the cocktails  maybe the starters  not for the sushi 

In reverse order  There was really nothing redeeming about the sushi  unfortunately  The rice was excessive in quantity and not very tasty  The ingredients were extremely ordinary quality  especially for the price  We got the pork belly buns  which were the highlight  and the hake + prawn gyoza  which were not bad  but I wouldnt get them again  The cocktails were the highlight  including the epitome of an old fashioned  �according to my dining companion "
R0074,Dont visit very often but I have never been disappointed 
R0074,Easy to book online and a good place to have a long lunch 
R0074,"Excellent service staff very pleasant and helpful 
Will Defo be back 
Food excellent as always"
R0074,Excellent service  excellent food  excellent drinks  excellent atmosphere  First visit  will definitely be back 
R0074,Excellent service  food and value as always  Highly recommend
R0074,Extremely slow never gave cutlery for dinner or dessert  Took ages to order and to receive food
R0074,"Following this review a manager emailed and ask for ourselves to contact them  We did and guess what no response  Another example of this establishments poor customer service 



Ate here last Friday evening  Slow to get a table even though we had booked  Ordered food and wine  Wrong wine arrived  No plates with our shared starter  Main course Surf and Turf arrived without the surf  Restaurant was closing so no time for desert  The waitress even asked for a tip  Definitely relies on passing travellers staying at adjacent hotels  No someone id recommend or return to "
R0074,Food is lovely but service is so bad  I booked a table for 1:30pm ended up being seated at a shared table at 2:10  My 3rd time there with such such bad service
R0074,food order wrong  different food put down in front of of us  Then taken away  Coffee cold  Food was delicious  staff were friendly 
R0074,Food was very dry and expensive  we both left hungry 
R0074,Great dinner and in particular the service was great as there was a mix up but they handled it perfectly and fun
R0074,Great food and better service  Thank you for a great experience  I would recommend to eat here if you stop in Dublin
R0074,"Had a good time with my friends over here 
Great service   
Silvio is a funny fella but Shyam has the best cocktails 
Highly recommend this place"
R0074,Had visitors from Australia   All 3 of us had the cod   all 3 thought portions were very small 
R0074,Have eaten here a number of times and food never disappoints  This time however the service wasnt up to standard  The hostess seemed disinterested and not at all friendly  This has never been our experience here before  We dealt with her on a number of occasions during our meal and she was distant and not at all pleasant  I will return as I feel her manner wasnt reflective of the service we normally receive
R0074,Highly over crowded left waiting a long time despite having a reservation  The food came out cold
R0074,I was a bit disappointed with my recent experience  I waited a while for my order to be taken as it seemed they forgot about our table  People seated after us were served  then I had to ask can we place our order  Also my poached eggs arrived hard and rashers with white bits 
R0074,"I was sat in the basement for our meal between birthday parties  It was one of the least enjoyable over priced jokes Ive experienced  �I expected a quiet evening meal with my family  was not what happened 
Will not return "
R0074,"I was slightly disappointed with everything really   I expected more �  in particular the service 
Got the braised pork cheek   was OK lentils where bit hard 
Steak for mains   has better nothing special 

Service was very lack lustre   there was something missing    Or was it just an off day    Who knows but I wouldnt rush back given the amount of too restaurants to choose from"
R0074,Ive been going here regularly its always hit and miss  The food however is consistently good  but the service can be atrocious  It was really just appalling yesterday and will think twice about going back 
R0074,"Just flagging this as a place vegetarians  and any paying customer who wants to be treated with respect if a problem arises  should avoid 
I tried to state that for me this was a serious issue  but I didnt really get a chance  Almost immediately she interrupted me to say that it was the servers first day  I tried to explain that the initial mistake didnt really bother me  everyone makes mistakes  and I have no interest in blaming individuals    but that the lack of apology or even     any kind of recognition that this might be upsetting for me did bother me  Again  I didnt really get to make my point  as I was silenced by her  She literally repeated herself and argued with me without listening to my points until I shut up  and her tone was combative and unpleasant  
I felt not listened to and disrespected as I left the restaurant  I will never go here again "
R0074,"Super unprofessional  



"
R0074,Just had us situated near the door and the breeze from going in and out was annoying plus had my 6 month son with us too just think the place is too noisy when ur up there to have ur breakfast or lunch
R0074,Lovely staff fab food 
R0074,"Noisey at 7  kids still eating in restaurant fmains was bland  no seasoning and one piece of  veg  just seemed so skimpy 
However service was good  but would not return"
R0074,"Our reservation was at 630  The entire party arrived 645  It took over 45 min to get the starters  The main course took another 45 min to arrive  The chicken was dry  steak was cold and falafel with sun dried tomato instead of Hummus  which no one informed us that would be the case as my girlfriend does not stand tomatoes at all  

The falafel plate was returned and we asked the waiter to take it off the bill   The bill came TWICE with the falafel there   

We end up spending over 2 hours in the restaurant and missed our movie that we booked  

Over all it was very bad experience  Especially when we tried to give them the benefit of the doubt as few weeks ago the same delay happened "
R0074,Over all we found this restrant to be over hyped too crowded and especially  not value for money   Very Dissatisfied
R0074,Pre booked but seated upstairs which was a bit quite but still very nice the food was lovely but nearly all deserts not available  
R0074,"Service was extremely slow  perhaps due to being understaffed during a very busy Sunday evening   2 different waiters forgot our orders in 3 different occasions  Music was very quiet upstairs compared to the downstairs dining area  almost making an odd empty atmosphere  Food was great though 
Would recommend working on their service "
R0074,Service was poor  45 mins waiting on food  There was 7 of us however all we ordered were sandwiches  Coffees came after 20 minutes but were either cold or finished by the time the food arrived  No apologies from staff about delay  Deliberately went in at 12pm to avoid lunchtime rush but didnt seem to matter 
R0074,Slow service  starter were served quickly  however plates were not cleared for 20 mins  we had to ask the waiting staff to take plate  We were waiting over an hour for our main course  Waiting staff were very poor 
R0074,The food is good  but the service was quite poor   We were served our desserts while there was still empty starter dishes on the table  We also had to proactively find staff so we could order desserts a long while after finishing mains
R0074,"The worst burger Ive ever had 
This place is a joke  An omg burger that was cooked to the point of being completely flavourless  No seasoning whatsoever 
The burger tasted like the bottom of a runner 
My friends was much the same  The only thing that was decent was the onion rings 

For 35 euro its safe to say Ill never be back here as long as Ive got taste buds and common sense "
R0074,Think its redundant to review a major corporation  Then think again  we have the internet and im not afraid to use it  anymore   Everything seemed to be made NOT from fresh and I didnt see one nice thing despite looking at the menu for ages  Poor vegetarian options  vegan seemingly non existent  and id question if the fish was caught in Ireland like their Beef The art on the walls is appaling and I should know a thing or two   Having said that  the place does all the coffees you can imagine  besides chai  toilets were ok  but whats with the lack of mirrors 
R0074,"Very noisy  near door to smoking area    door opening and closing constantly   service slow   appeared to be understaffed   lunch time takeaways appear to have a priority over table service  

I would be a good customer of Malahide and Swords  and was disappointed with Santry "
R0074,Waiting extremely long for table even though we reserved a table  food was ok   took ages to get any attention from waiting staff  
R0074,"We came here after a few drinks on a Saturday 

We were promptly given a seat with no booking which was good �and from the outset the staff were very friendly 

I made up my own burger and got a side of chips with a seasoned salt on them but couldnt really taste it  needed more 

Burger was very tasty and chips were well cooked but I dont know  something is missing from this place 

It has no wow factor but its a solid eat and for the price you cant really complain 

For the reasons above I can only really give it 3 stars as its one of those standard burger places which you cant fault  but also are not rushing back to "
R0074,We have been many times to this place in Santorum and it was one of our favourite restaurants but in past few months we noticed a difference  We were there this weekend and had booked table for 2 45 as in hurry   we got our table at 3 15  We had to ask many times for water and ketchup and eventually after asking twice we received the dessert menu  Staff didnt seem to be in any hurry to assist people and it really looked very disorganised for a busy sunday afternoon  Very disappointing 
R0074,We have been to this restaurant on many occasions and this was the worst we have ever had  While I ordered a Huavous  Rancheros and it was ok  not as good as past times and lacking in the amount of black pudding  which was an extra  Euro 2  with a thimble of guacamole and sour cream  My husband  who is coeliac  ordered the Kickstart Breakfast and it was seriously lacking  He asked for mushrooms instead of the Rosti  as it contains gluten  which wasnt a problem  I also ordered a Rustic Chips  which never arrived  But my husbands meal  which he has gotten on many previous times  had a look of a pre cooked meal  The mushroom were dry and lukewarm  as were the eggs  The guacamole  named as a main part of the dish and not just an accompaniment  was tiny  And the dish came with no bacon  When we asked about the bacon  it did come very quickly  and it too looked precooked and was rubbery  Also  no marmalade was available  not the first time this has happened  We were very disappointed with this meal  costing nearly  Euro 30  with two coffees  There are so many more establishments around that offer much fresher and better food  I think we wont be back 
R0074,We have had breakfast here a few times which has been lovely and the staff were very attentive and friendly  However last night we went for dinner to the santry location to give it a go and it was the complete opposite to any other experience  From the get go the service was apppalling  The waitress who seated us and served us our drink was a sloppy mess and covered in ketchup stains and could not even crack a fake smile  The waiter who took our order who referred to himself as Peter  after half an hour of waiting mind you  was shockingly rude  He had zero people or communication skills  and was a complete disgrace  He brought the wrong drinks to the table and told us we must have ordered the wrong drinks only to look at his notepad and see we in fact did not  He did not give us cutlery and told us we could just take some off another table  only for us then to be brought cold food  We had not even finished our dinner and he had put our bill in front of us  It was one thing after another and several tables around us were also complaining and as a result getting drinks on the house  The restaurant was honestly a circus This was a massive let down  The staff last night were sloppy  rude and are most certainly not cut out for hospitality and it was a shame 
R0075, Nice calamari  smoking area at the balcony  Bit crowded but its ok  Tasty cocktails  Id tried old fashion in there  There are moments wen its really hard to catch staff and they are sometimes not sure whats in the menu     but they are catching up with the attitude   very polite 
R0075,A beautiful eating experience  Everything about this place is amazing 
R0075,A lovely venue and concept but unfortunately did not enjoy our experience here  Found the portion sizes far too small  and found out after the visit that its more of a sharing plates concept  However this was not communicated to us by our server  Prices high  Did not find service very helpful  Did not enjoy the flavour of my vegan broccoli pasta dish either  Wish I could write a better review 
R0075,"Absolutely awful  A group of 4 of us went for a nice meal and we were greeted nicely and seated and then ignored for so long  A hour between getting served our food and the plates being cleared and asking if we wanted desert  Then another 20 minutes between getting given a menu and ordering  I was overcharged for the desert I ordered and when I brought it up and showed where I got the price on the menu they had handed me they said that I ordered off the wrong menu  They seemed to put the blame on me even though they gave me that menu  The only time they were quick in doing something was when they were taking our money off us  

This whole experience was disappointing  Being busy could not even be the reason for this bad service as there was only 3 tables of people in the whole place "
R0075,"Absolutely gorgeous  Superb food  lovely service  Ive nothing but praise for Grano  

Well be back "
R0075,All dishes were stunning  the tiramisu is a must  
R0075,Amazing meal and wonderful staff  Ill defiantly be back 
R0075,Beautiful food  Lovely staff  And gorgeous Italian menu 
R0075,beautiful traditional food  completely true to its roots and delicious from start to finish
R0075,Can not fault from the food to the fantastic service  The steak was possibly the best Ive ever had 
R0075,"Do not believe the hype 
"
R0075,Fantastic restaurant super food great wine  and some of the best service Ive had and the tiramisu  will be back soon
R0075,Food and staff we amazing  highly recommend
R0075,Great food  great staff and the manager was very helpful and friendly
R0075,Great food  small area so was a wait to be seated inside but we were happy to sit outside so no wait  Food came quickly  was delicious  huge portions 
R0075,Great in every way possible food staff service delivery   if u want real Thai food then u no were to go   thanks guys
R0075,Great place  �Best coffee  �Good pastries  �The use real whip cream on the coffees  �Give it a try 
R0075,I have eaten here on a number of occasions and food is always excellent  Excellent wine list too  Try SW france wines eg madiran 
R0075,Im so glad to have this little jewel near me and will be back again soon
R0075,It was my second time here and once again the food was super  This was lunch rather than dinner so it was quieter but still had a very nice buzz 
R0075,nice food but waiting over one hour for a main course of Pasta and Tomato sauce was most frustrating
R0075,Overall experience was good  Starter and wine were excellent but mains let it down  Lack of flavour in pasta dishes 
R0075,Portions were very small and a little overpriced for what they were  Have had better Italian food  The service was okay though 
R0075,"Pros: food and service  flawless  
Cons: the noise  Please put sound absorbing cushion fabric under the tables and seats "
R0075,Really good   loved the spaghetti alle vongole special  my favourite   All four of us were very impressed 
R0075,"Scaldanduja and Frisella Di Farro starter were incredible
Wine pairing suggested by the waiter hit the spot
great atmosphere and service   will be back asap"
R0075,The bar/wait staff are part of the experience here  �Clever and quippy with a smile  they serve great drinks and incredible Irish food  �Dont miss the Beef and Guinness Pie 
R0075,The food was absolutely delicious  Great atmosphere and brilliant service  Will be back 
R0075,"The portion size of the main was not that big for the price  The pasta dish was very bland and not tasty  
The wine was and service was lovely "
R0075,Very good service and food so fresh    try the tiramisu it was a dream and the piece was so generous    Yummy
R0075,We spend a lot of time in Italy and this is the closest thing in Dublin to an authentic Italian restaurant 
R0075,"While the starter and main course are delicious  the staff  owners not waitress  failed to let us know that our choice of plate was no longer available and presented us with a diff dish without giving us the choice to make our own choice  

Furthermore the pasta dishes with tomato sauce were drenched in passata to the point that it took away any authenticity of home made sauce instead it was obvious that it came from a large tub of passata  

It was only my second time there and I will not be returning "
R0075,"Wonderful  flavoursome  authentic Italian food  The wine list is pricey but comprehensive and the desserts are divine  

Service was pleasant and welcoming "
R0076,Really friendly and efficient staff  Lovely food at excellent price
R0077, Euro 25 was very expensive for my lamb shank  it was very fatty and didnt fall off the bone I ended up bringing it home to give to my dog 
R0077,Appalling customer service from the moment we arrived  Food took an eternity to arrive when we finally managed to call someone to take our order during what was early and not so busy reservation  4:00   We ordered a �Chocolate Brownie with Mint Icecream� as it was described on the menu  It arrived and included walnuts as one of its main ingredients  The person in our party who ordered this has a nut allergy and ordered this on the basis of this being nut free due to no mention in the description or allergen information attached  When we informed management of this issue we were rudely fobbed off and dismissed with no apology  Overall a very poor experience with a major defecit of customer service and appreciation  Will not be back 
R0077,Been here a couple of times and found the food to be nice but felt totally discriminated against  several Asian customers who entered the restaurant after us and ordered after us were served their food before us and we had to wait over 20mins for our food and watch others who came long after us get their main course while we still awaited our starters    safe to say I will avoid in the future as will my partner   
R0077,booked through online app for 16:15 for 3 people  2 adults one child  arrived 15 mins early and checked in to wait for our table    had to go back 3 times to ask if our table was ready   we were eventually seated with our child at about 16:45ish   we had bought a bottle of wine from off license which was great value and christmas lights and atmosphere cant be faulted   everything else was a disaster and an utter disappointment   our order was taken and half hour later the food arrived  my husband had the roast which was just warm   i had the fish and chips which was fine and our son who was ravenous at this stage had his food arrive and then the order was totally wrong   not what he had wanted at all and not what he would eat    hes 4   i was told what we ordered wasnt available but at no point did anyone tell us and give the option to order something else   then bill came and they tried to charge us  Euro 6 95 for my sons ive cream which was included in the kids menu    and the ice cream was another 40 minute wait    overall an utterly terrible experience in total were were served by 8 different servers   and the whole place just is totally disorganized and chaotic the staff are lovely but obviously badly managed and directed    what should have been and early sunday dinner treat out was nearly a 3 hr farce     wont be going back which is a shame as were local and like to support local    just poor poor service
R0077,Christmas decorations up in the middle of January is a bit ridiculous the night I was there an adjoining party had difficulty with the fact that they had to vacate the table as it was not adequately pointed out to them that there was a time limit on the table there was three elderly people in the party and it was handled very poorly the restaurant manager did not take their age into consideration when that party finally left I witnessed him laughing with other staff members mocking them as they had spent  Euro  200 his attitude was what did they want to stay there for 2days very bad form he should have had more respect regards  
R0077,Disappointed order was wrong childrens chicken was so full of oil when pressed it oozed all over the place both went back adults we got kids portions apparently they asked did children want anything else they got a portion of fries and one brownie which tasted like it was weeks old mint ice cream was nice we were charged for fries and brownie I have always brought family/ friends here never again
R0077,"Even though the nice waiter knew of my coeliac restrictions and he checked the food  only a main course  curry  I ordered was gluten free with the kitchen  It was clearly not as I was sick same evening 

Very disappointed "
R0077,Family get together for Christmas good service  Overall happy
R0077,Fantastic restaurant  Amazing Christmas atmosphere 
R0077,Food and staff very nice  Service was slow and we had to wait 30 mins before being told one of the mains was not available 
R0077,Food used to be very good but 4 bad experiences in a row now  one time due to service and 3 due to food  Left feeling very disappointed 
R0077,Foot was ok but service very slow  It took close on one hour for our food to arrive 
R0077,Good deals with early bird  It is a bit expensive but food is very tasty
R0077,Great location  great food and so fabulous at Christmas time 
R0077,Had dinner here this evening and not entirely sure what to make of it  Chowder starter was OK  though not as creamy as you would expect chowder to be  Given that it was a starter  I didnt mind that so much but others at the table were not impressed  For main  I had the smoked haddock with potato and onions in white sauce  It was tasty  fish was great but overall lacked a little something  Had the chocolate fondant and white chocolate icecream dessert  Now that was truly exceptional  Overall average experience vastly overpriced for what you get 
R0077,Had no record of our booking so never got to have meal  Had booked for confirmation  wouldnt recommend to anyone 
R0077,Had table booked for 6 45 arrived on time  was left waiting for table till 7  Was just on the point of leaving  Guy in charge of seating was rude and not able for his job  Waiting staff were excellent  He was the only bad experience of the night
R0077,Heavy food  not best quality of ingredients  low quality furniture  not the nicest quartier  really not at the level and ranking should be rated at  Aspergus with mayo  would expect more than that  smell of fries when leaving the restaurant 
R0077,I was really disappointed with my experience on Saturday  When we arrived at the restaurant we were told there was no booking due to an online error  a friend of mine also experienced a similar issue a few weeks back  so I cannot understand why the issue was not rectified after that time  We had a drink while we were waiting  and we were eventually shown to our table more than an hour after we had made the booking for  What I was most annoyed by was the fact that nobody apologized to us for the delay  a complimentary drink would have been appreciated  as the delay in the table meant we spent more on drinks  I was conscious that the restaurant was very busy  but no member of staff returned to our table once dinner was served  we had no opportunity to look at the dessert menu or order anything else  which is not good enough  Ive eaten here on many occasions and love the cosy atmosphere  but after my most recent experience I will not be hurrying back  nor will I recommend it to friends  I would like to mention I ordered the fish stew and it was delicious  but not good enough to counteract the other negatives 
R0077,I was very disappointed with this restaurant  the service was non existent  we were left waiting a long for food with no explanation  except a muttered sorry for the delay when the food eventually arrived  No reason was given for the delay for an order of 4 burgers and I Sunday roast and no food arrived until after I had spoken to 2 members of staff  I found it hard to understand as there seemed at least 4 chefs working in the kitchen who didnt look under pressure at all  in fact joking and laughing  I wont be returning to the Hole in the Wall and in fact I felt responsible for my familys disappointing delayed lunch as I booked and chose this venue 
R0077,"I work as a driver occasionally been to all the best restaurants in Dublin and have had the best service but this is one of the worst restaurant  I went there to collect a food to deliver  My app had a note on it that please mention your order number to the staff and wait in the lobby  which is not a lobby   Up on my arrival I did not received a greet but instead someone from far away shouted ""can your please wait outside"" it was too dark inside to see his face  I quietly �went outside and sat on a platform outside in the lobby  After few minutes a waiter arrived again no greet he straight away said that you cant sit here as this is a restaurant  he then said customers are sitting here  I then replied customers are sitting inside in table not on your lobbys platform "
R0077,"Im hoping my experience was a one off for this place  Im often skeptical of Asian food in cities that have a low Asian population  but I try to be open minded  The reviews looked really positive  so I decided to give it a shot  One reviewer said she lived in Japan and she kept coming back to this restaurant  so I felt that was a solid recommendation  But for me  the service and food were both extremely subpar 

I came here just before 12:30pm on a Friday and it was already a bit busy  There were no tables available but there was 1 counter seat left near the kitchen  Since it was just me and it was my lunch break  I was happy to sit there and not wait for a table 

The waitress then forgot about me for the next 10 minutes and every other staff member just walked by obliviously even though I tried to get their attention  I finally caught the waitress eye  who then said  ""oh yeah "" and made a gesture that indicated she had completely forgotten I was there 

I asked a couple questions about the menu but she didnt know the answers  Both times she attempted to read the menu to find the answers  which I of course had read but still had questions  hence the reason I asked her  I then asked about the Steamed Bun with Spicy Sauce  part of their lunch special   I sort of had an idea but wanted to confirm and at first she said it was a dumpling  but then she went to the kitchen to ask and told me it was a sandwich filled with meat  I didnt dare ask her what kind of meat because I knew she wouldnt know 

I ended up ordering the Tonkotsu Butter Miso Ramen and the Steamed Bun with Spicy Sauce  The meat in the steamed bun was salty and very tough to chew  and the bun was cold 

As for the ramen  I typically order a miso based broth when I go out for ramen  so Im not sure if its the mixture of the tonkotsu broth  but this was the saltiest ramen I have ever had in my entire life   not only the broth  but also the egg   Though to be fair  the eggs that come with ramen are marinated  and I probably find them to be salty 70 percent of the time   Also   the seaweed smell was overpowering; the meat  choi sum  and egg were cold  and while Im sure there werent any mushrooms  there was a mushroomy taste  I couldve dealt with all the latter points if it werent so salty overall  Honestly the cold stuff is fine once you mix it in with the hot broth; it was just unexpected  I probably ate at most 25 percent of the ramen before my stomach couldnt handle the bowl of sodium any longer 

Again  hoping this was a one off; though I cant risk giving it a second chance myself "
R0077,"Just had such a terrible experience  I ordered upon arrival and the girl who greeted me was lovely  but I could tell the owner was stressed and maybe shorthanded right away  I asked what soup it was  the girl asked him  and he retorted ""what do you think it is 


"
R0077,Lovely atmosphere  lovely staff lovely food wonderful decorations  whats else you need 
R0077,Really poor service undermined the experience  The setting is lovely; the food was great  We had one course in 90 mins  Had to remind them to bring dessert menus and then did not come back for 20 mins to take the order 
R0077,Regular place  nothing to write home about  Decent beer  pleasant service  lousy food  The one thing that I liked was original decor  Rest is did not convince me to come back  though weve had there a nice evening 
R0077,"Service was atrocious from start to end 
No one came near us for 20 Mins after we were seated  had to get own drinks  No one came near us when main course was served for drinks  Ate food without drink  When we complained  waiter wasnt bothered  My son has dairy intolerance  waitress went off to enquire  about dairy free option desserts  never came back  Another waiter arrived with dairy ice cream  when we asked where they dairy free  he just glared at me  and  asked if we wanted it or not  and  walked off with them 
We complained again to another waitress who did apologise for the poor service  and  gave us a free drink  but it was too little too late   Also  we had been there at Halloween  and  found the price hike in menu scandalous   We will Not be returning nor will we be recommending to friends  We have traditionally visited this pub annually   and  although the place looks fabulous   and  the food is delicious  the very bad service just lets everything down "
R0077,Taste of buffalo wings werent the best  would not order them again
R0077,"The restaurant l at Christmas is truly magical and an experience not to miss 
The wine shop at the centre of the pub is a gem "
R0077,The service we received was very poor  one the waiters and older guy short hair/bald was very short and rude to us  The food is very overrated  got chicken wings to start that were dry and all bone  no meat on them at all  The mains took 40 minutes to come after we had our starters and the quality of the food was poor  tasted cheap  Didnt stay for desert wanted to leave as soon as possible 
R0077,Touristy  as expected  Would have been better if veggie food had been on the menu  Music was ok  We are looking for better places 
R0077,"Used to be one of my favourite spots when I moved to Clontarf seven years ago  The service was always good  the food was always tasty and quick  However  things have changed  I think their menu has become too diverse and instead of offering good quality pasta and pizza they now offer Thai curry quesadillas and burgers  Its the old case of trying to please everyone and then pleasing no one  

I had a margherita pizza which was topped with really salty cheddar cheese along with mozzarella  Cheddar has no place on a pizza people  The base was chewy and the sauce was bland  probably just as well as the overwhelming taste of salt couldnt have handled another flavour  �My companion had the Thai green curry which was watery and flavourless and packed all the punch of a sleeping newborn  To be honest  I wont be rushing back but I doubt it will bother them in anyway as its always packed with families "
R0077,Very disappointing  Service was poor and then the chocolate desert contained nuts yet no notice in advance
R0077,Very nice evening   great that the decorations were still up 
R0077,Wasnt bad but we got seated ordered and  didnt get our food for 45 mins so we were quite hungry but I understand it can be busy and these things happen  overall good but prob wont be back nothing special 
R0077,We had a very disappointing experience in this place  My mother is in a wheelchair and I checked to see if you had wheelchair access before I booked  It was horrendous  We could not get through the doors comfortably  Patrons had to get up of their seats to move a bench  Then I had to lift my mother out of her chair and get her to walk up 2 steps to the table I booked  When our order was taken we ordered a bottle of wine  45 mins later still no sign of it  we had to look for the waiter  then he brought a bottle of red wine when we ordered white  Over an hour waiting on starters  Food overall was nice enough  When leaving  a side door was opened for us but yet again had to take my 84 year old mother out of the chair as their was a high step to get down  Carpark full of potholes  Will not be going back 
R0077,we had an appointment for 8 30 when we arrived no body asked us if we had an appointment o we we went looking for a table ourselves  we ended up in the very back of the long bar found a table and sat down to a table that was not prepared  as we discovered there was a funeral going on and it was very sad as it was for a 7 year old boy so there was tears all around  it was valentines night   why did they not tell us there was a large group in and it was a funeral it took a long time for the food to come  out it was a very bad experience  our night was ruined
R0077,We thoroughly enjoyed a few drinks with the family in the wonderful Christmas atmosphere with attentive charming staff 
R0077,We went for the first time after getting a recommendation from a friend  The Christmas lights are amazing  very busy but great food and staff are all lovely
R0077,When we arrived and told waitress that we had a reservation she seemed to be a bit confused and walked off to speak with someone else without even saying anything to us  When she came back she was still very vague and I asked if everything was ok  She muttered something and then eventually brought us to a table which was off on its own in a tiny side room  I got the impression that shed given away our table but we were ten minutes early  Also the menu I feel needs to be changed and have a bit more choice on it 
R0078,  Tastiest burger in Dublin in my opinion  The selection is limited so dont go if your looking for options  If you want a really simple satisfying burger then no need to look elsewhere 
R0078," Cons: 
  some staff are lovely and other make a point of not looking at you in case you have the mad idea to ask them something  
  slow service  soo slow    We waited for our main course for almost 45 minutes  and again about 20 minutes for dessert  
  the quality of the food is okay  which is consistent with the cheap and cheerful approach of the place  but its gone on the bland side  
  desserts are way too sweet  the crumble was pure sugar and I couldnt finish it "
R0078,"Very disappointing  Food lacked imagination  Steak with no sauce and limp chips  Staff very nice but not efficient  Said they would bring veg after saying how boring it was    none arrived  

Dessert menu  very limited "
R0078,Absolutely outstanding  Cant wait to go back  Service was excellent  food was delicious  Thank you 
R0078,Amazing   
R0078,Amazing experience    Great service and delicious food      thank you Sean and team 
R0078,Amazing food and service  Chef menu excellent value  Highly recommend 
R0078,Amazing food  we did the tasting menu and would highly recommend  All very fresh and great service 
R0078,As always a treat to savor    has never disappointed
R0078,As always food was amazing  Highly recommend host for good quality food and great service  Perfect for all occasions  Well be back soon
R0078,Best restaurant in Dublin
R0078,Brought a group of VIPs here for a dinner and was thrilled with the service  food and overall experience  I could not have asked for a better venue for this important dinner  Stephen and Oscar were brilliant  I look forward to coming back and wish I could give a 10 star rating  
R0078,Brought my 10 year old daughter and she absolutely loved the steak 
R0078,Came here because one of my friends is gluten free  but we all found something we enjoyed  Decent amount of food for the price  We came back in the same weekend because we liked it so much 
R0078,"Celebrated my birthday with family and friends  
Great evening gorgeous food   We are always so well looked after by staff  and  chefs   
Top restaurant in the area"
R0078,Cold  noisy and simply strange   we asked the waiter could we sit somewhere else as sitting by the door was too cold  but we moved to the back where it was equally chilled  I ended up sitting with my jacket on  the waiter spotted this and avoided asking me if everything was ok  most likely because staff cant help due to limited budget and necessary cutbacks owner has taken   That said  waiter wasnt much help but was still friendly and hospitable  
R0078,Consistently great food and a lovely team makes for another thoroughly enjoyable experience
R0078,Delicious food  Probably THE BEST vegan pizza Ive ever had  They also have a fantastic menu + activity packets for kids 
R0078,"Disappointing in as much as the high table element is not clearly explained 
Food was not hot and had to be sent back to come back still the same   
Door not closing properly and allowed the elements to come in "
R0078,Excellent good and service as usual
R0078,Excellent  top quality  best restaurant in Dublin  Very unique 
R0078,"Extremely disappointed with my food here  Wish I had checked before I came doh 
"
R0078,Fabulous food and service  Chef Manuel all delicious but maybe too much food for me  Loved every dish however just couldnt finish it 
R0078,Fabulous meal
R0078,Food was amazing and the staff were incredibly attentive and polite  I would really recommend Host
R0078,Food was fine  but quantities super small  we had to eat something else when we arrived home  and the price was super super high  Not coming back  Service was great by the way 
R0078,For a coffee shop chain this is one of my favorites  I rebuke coffee and all of its forms but Im mad about tea  The breakfast tea is always exceptional  The seating is varied and produces a great choice depending on your needs  couches for long chats with friends or small tables for laptop work  I am giving this particular place two stars because  while the baristas in training were very helpful the seasoned veteran barista was not pleasant to be around  When I arrived the shop was almost empty of customers and he was the only one behind the till  I made eye contact  smiled and waited for a welcome of some kind as usual  He barely glanced up at me and was silent even as I stood in front of the counter  Finally  I said hello to which he gave a curt reply and went about his business  leaving me to wait for the very friendly trainee to see to me  Later  the same worker started banging on the locked bathroom door and was yelling to the man inside that he needed to hurry up and get out  He did this for several minutes and then continued to scold the older man who looked a little rough and not with it mentally but who did not need to be treated in such a manner  It gave the whole shop a bad atmosphere and made me and Im sure others extremely uncomfortable  I left shortly after that because his bad energy continued in his interactions with other customers  banging down plates/mugs  jerking chairs away close to people when they didnt need to be moved  Bad energy like that is enough to keep me away from the shop if he is there  Dublin has a myriad of great coffee shops with pleasant  customer service oriented workers and Id rather take my business there 
R0078,Great casual place with amazing food  The wings were amazing and the hamburgers are delicious 
R0078,Great restaurant  wonderful food  Counter seating is very uncomfortable 
R0078,I had the clam chowder  Id say one of the best Ive ever tried  Service was great  very friendly environment 
R0078,I went with my husband for a date night  It is a wonderful restaurant  Great food  wine and service  Highly recommend 
R0078,"Located in a nice part of town  just outside of city center 
Good lunch menu choice and great quality 
Will be back again "
R0078,Loved the food  staff were very friendly  theres a very cool Irish hostess with glasses and a piercing that made it very comfortable and fun 
R0078,Lovely food but we were practically kicked off our table because there was another seating coming couldnt even finish our wine
R0078,Make sure you book here as youd be disappointed great place for stake chips cant wait to go back again
R0078,Nicest meal Ive had in Dublin in a long time   New favorite spot  
R0078,Not my cup of tea   Lots of ingredients but little flavor to the food
R0078,"Oh Purleeeease  

Dublin has so much better to offer than this place  

Theyve created a buzz with their reservation system but the cool space doesnt make up for the overpriced   if ok  food  the amateur fake begorrah style service and their unacceptable way of turfing out do they can squeeze in the �next   mostly tourist  unlucky souls 

Dont encourage them"
R0078,Ok food but way to expensive for what I got  Table facing window with back to restaurant felt very uncomfortable  Will not be returning ever 
R0078,Overpriced and very average food  I will not be going back notwithstanding how close it is to home 
R0078,"Personally  I found the atmosphere cold and for a restaurant with bordering on 30 covers  it was over staffed  The seating arrangements were poorly designed  to maximum profits in the long run  the service was extremely swift  in fact it made you feel under pressure  
The waiter we had was very pleasant  so no fault there  but the manager I believe she was he manager was quite short and abrasive  with zero flexibility from her plan as she put it 
Would I go back  Only if it was a quick bite to eat and run  and this seemed to be the ethos of the restaurant  Not having a full bar was a disappointment  and in fact when we asked about the lack of full bar  we were told  sure you can always pop next door to the Exchequer for a cocktail if we really wanted one  and they needed our table back at 8 15  and this was 6 15  
Its such a shame  as the food was excellent    "
R0078,Really enjoyable evening  had the chef tasting menu every course of which was very tasty  Really good wine and great service too 
R0078,The food and atmosphere were not that great  and the service was okayish 
R0078,The food here is great  as are the cocktails  Also the staff are so lovely  especially AJ who was very kind  I will definitely be back in the future 
R0078,The food was nice but waiter didnt bring back our change  We would have tipped anyway but didnt like that he assumed he could keep the change 
R0078,The guy on the phone couldnt be more rude or care less  Didnt have the opportunity to taste the pizza because IT NEVER MADE IT 
R0078,They did not have our booking but they did accommodate us as I had the email  Unlikely i would use online booking due to this error 
R0078,Very expensive  quality of food had gone way down  i felt it was much better on previous visit way to m it sauce on everything   
R0078,We had a delicious meal with lovely surrounding and fabulous service  An all round winner for any occasion  Will definitely be back very soon 
R0078,Went here just before I saw a film   there drinks are very good  I ordered a strawberry daiquiri and it was Devine  There wine from Chile wasnt too amazing but your not breaking the bank with their prices  Didnt have food here but it looked delish from other tables  Only problem with the place was that the service was a bit slow and there was a horrible draft of cold air  I couldnt take my jacket off for the whole evening 
R0079,A nice and friendly restaurant proving tasty Italian food  Good service and pleasant atmosphere at a reasonable price 
R0079,As this restaurant had good reviews  I had high hopes  I was impressed that the waiter who seated us quickly returned to tell us he would move us to the next table over once its current occupant had left  as it was a better table  The starters  minestrone soup; prawn + leeks  were fine  although Im never a fan of unpeeled prawns and the strawberry cream with the prawns was just    odd  The mains  however  were the real disappointment  The risotto was basically a plate of unseasoned rice with a few prawns and slivers of radish lurking in it  and the cannelloni had either been overdone on reheat  or left under a heat lamp too long  as the sauce had a skin on it and some of the pasta was burnt  We had to ask twice for the dessert menu as the first waiter we asked didnt return  We opted to skip the desserts and ordered a Baileys coffee and a regular americano; the americano turned up quickly  but first we were told they had no Baileys and offered a Calypso coffee instead  and then /that/ failed to show up to the point where we had to ask again at which point it turned up almost immediately  and had clearly been sitting somewhere while we waited for it as it was lukewarm 
R0079,Everything was excellent but especially the service from the second we walked in until we left and they called us a cab back to our hotel 
R0079,"Excellent authentic food  attentive waiting staff and the owner charming and helpful 
All in all and excellent meal and dinning experience "
R0079,Good food  service too  very good vine selection  I like it
R0079,"Great place  small and cozy along the quays
Had 3 meals here  and all have been incredible  
Their cherry duck is AMAZING  
Service is tops too "
R0079,Lovely authentic italian cuisine  Delicious homemade pasta  The Carpaccio was really good  Nice atmosphere  Very friendly and personal service 
R0079,Lovely dinner for our last night in Dublin   Highly recommend it 
R0079,Lovely food and friendly staff  will definitely be making a return visit
R0079,Not interested in writing a formal review  The service was very friendly and the food was outstanding 
R0079,One of the best Italien restsurants we have esten in Great food great service and  authentic dishes  We shall return   
R0079,Outstanding meal and service 
R0079,Perfectly prepared Italian food  creative menu  exceptional service in a lovely setting 
R0079,Pleasant evening but food nothing special  Not sure why this restaurant gets good reviews 
R0079,Service was fantastic and all food so good  Very fresh pasta and the burrata appetizer special was to die for  Excellent wine selection as well 
R0079,Some of the most authentic food Ive had outside of Italy  Excellent flavors  The staff was helpful and their knowledge of wine was perfect for our male  We will be back 
R0079,the main person at the dinner was very disappointed because there was no tiramisu left   but otherwise excellent  Thank you 
R0079,Very disappointing  Made reservation weeks in advance for second night in Dublin  Upon arrival in Dublin from US  got a message that restaurant had unilaterally cancelled our reservation with explanation or apology 
R0079,Very good   Then Cannelloni was so good  Highly recommend this restaurant 
R0079,"We had the carbonara  and it was without doubt top 5 worst pastas Ive ever had  It practically didnt taste anything accept a strange hint of gas  
Blender was broken so we couldnt have a daiquiri and the fact that it was Good Friday and we had water to drink didnt really boost the experience in a good way  
The White chocolate raspberry cheesecake was good  but not close to how good it should have been to raise the grade to a 3/5  
Service was barely ok  after we finished the food it took about 20 minutes before anyone came to our table  same thing after deserts  
Would not recommend anyone to go to this place really "
R0079,We went for a family lunch mid week to celebrate a graduation  Food was lovely and staff were very pleasant 
R0080,A little out from the centre but worth the effort to find  Nice menu  presented well by the friendly staff 
R0080,Great beer  fantastic food  wonderful service  and artistic energy  Thank you 
R0080,Great service and food  �Highlights of the night include the scallops appetizer  probably the best Ive ever had  and the venison  �Service was attentive and kind  �Id recommend this restaurant
R0080,Had a fab meal  and  some margaritas here last night  Lovely staff  and  Beach House playing on the soundsystem  Very enjoyable 
R0080,Sunday roast and all the trimmings  Will be back in for a proper steak soon  Im expecting good things  based on my Sunday evening meal experiences 
R0080,The atmosphere is great  and once the music starts its even better  Bangers  and  Mash were excellent  and the selection of beers and whiskey kept us there for several hours  
R0081,A find  small restaurant with a small menu and better for it with a high standard of cooking and pleasant staff
R0081,Had a lovely meal again at the curry club food absolutely gorgeous and value for money  They always make the children feel so welcome
R0081,We were surprised to find this place off the main road  but the pizza and wine was fabulous  This place could be in NYC 
R0082,Beautiful setting   very friendly staff and amazing food  
R0083,GReat atmosphere  
R0083,A bit rushed   our bottle of wine was poured 2 times to fill our glasses   without our consent  and plates taken attempted to be take away when still half full   They had us in and out in 45 mins   Wont go back  
R0083,Absolutely amazing food  great value for money   super friendly staff and awesome wine  5 stars
R0083,"After being back two more times I have come to the conclusion that the place appears to have dropped its standards  when it comes to the food anyway 

On the last occasion I ordered chicken skewers as a main  I had tried it previously when it came as a part of a meat platter  I double checked with our server to make sure it was the same dish before I ordered and they said it was  

It bore no resemblance to what I had tried before  It was dry and was lacking the tasty marinade I had experienced before  

Its a shame  They started so promisingly "
R0083,An expensive  mediocre and disappointing meal  Stay away
R0083,Been to Bazils a few times  To Pizzas absolutely gorgeous  Highly recommended it  John
R0083,Brilliant customer service  and  tasty food
R0083,Another criticism is that they have a burger meal deal for around  Euro 10  I asked the girl could I get sweet potato fries instead and pay the extra  She said they couldnt do that and id have to just purchase them for the full side order price  So we ended up with two normal fries each and a sweet potato fries to share  The normal fries were both cold but the sweet potato fries were fresh and so so tasty  Its really a pet hate of mine when places like these wont accommodate customers and allow them to pay the extra euro or whatever it is to get sweet potato fries INSTEAD of normal fries  Sweet potato fries are the new way to go and everyone loves them so its not like its an unrealistic request 
R0083,"Considering that literally is the same proposal  just to name 2    the quality of the dishes are below average but same price 
Really disappointed and I wouldnt recommend it "
R0083,Disappointing service v poor we were left waiting and spent our time trying to catch the eye of any waiter   as most other tables also doing  to try to get service there was a door constantly opening n closing for smokers which meant cold draughts no loo paper in ladies and over flowing bins
R0083,I have had better salads from the ready meal section at super markets  This place is certainly not helping the stereotype that vegan food is bland crunchy granola slop 
R0083,Excelent plates and flavors  just a very very good restaurant  Completely recommended 
R0083,Fantastic  Wonderful food  service with a nice wine list  Really enjoyed this restaurant 
R0083,"Food is amazing and the staff couldnt have been nicer  
Would highly recommend it and cant wakt to return"
R0083,"Food was lovely    however   
Had a booking for 3 people at 7 on a Saturday evening  Got a phone call of confirmation on the Thursday saying the table was required back by 9   which was fine  We arrived 10 minutes late and were reminded that the table was needed back by 9  We skipped the starters and went straight for mains   food was delicious but didnt arrive until well after 8  At 8:40 I asked for the dessert menu   initially I was told I couldnt have it as the table was needed back   then we were told we could eat dessert at the bar   then we were told we could stay where we were so we ordered  As soon as wed ordered the waiter came with the bill  Dessert finally arrived after 9 and as soon as we put the spoon down we were told to leave     We only managed to have a glass of wine each  I have never felt so rushed   yes we were 10 minutes late but it should be possible to serve 3 courses in 2 hours  Wont be going back "
R0083,Food was OK at best  Pork cheek was dry  Wine was very good
R0083,food was very if not below average  Service uninterested  And woefully overpriced 
R0083,FOOD: The gnocchi were under cooked  hard and with an horrible texture  Thats not how you prepare gnocchi  Very disappointing  The combination of Venison  cavolo verde and wine reduction didnt work and I could not finish the plate even tought it was thiny
R0083,Good food  bad service  �After I noted there was only one queue for both takeaway lunches and seating for tables  � I kindly asked the server to note I was waiting on a table  She rudely told �me to keep waiting and then when a table opened up  she skipped me and offered the people in the queue who �had arrived after me a table  I had to aggressively interject that id been waiting a full 10 minutes longer than they had  At lunch  I ordered a salad  and only half way through eating it did I realise it was the wrong salad  loaded with an ingredient I truly cannot eat  �Im not a picky eater and attempted to eat around the ingredient  and thought Id been Confused and In my lunch rush maybe I had misread the menu  �I re read the menu and realised I had truly been served the wrong salad  When I brought this to the attention of the server  she rudely pointed out to me that I had eaten half the salad and I should have brought this to her �attention earlier  �I tried to explain to her as it was my first time eating there and bc we were in such a rush for lunch  especially after waiting so long in the queue  that I thought Id misread the menu and mistakenly not noticed it was an ingredient  �I felt annoyed they gave �me the wrong order  and failed to provide an apology  �Ill go back to parigi bc the food is good and location convenient  �but Ill be prepared for bad service 
R0083,Great place to stop and have a pint 
R0083,Great setting but food very average  Food was ready in less that 5 mins of ordering  Food arrived before our drinks  Order was wrong and then correct dish was ready in less than 3 mins   always a worrying sign  Had to ask 3 times for our drinks  The place looks the part but certainly not value for money  Great for Instagram not great for eating 
R0083,Great service great food loved it will go back 
R0083,I love the atmosphere here  The food is amazing and so is the service  The steak is unbelievable  would highly recommend 
R0083,I make it easy: Best Burgerplace In Town  Creative  high quility  friendly staff  good pale ale  Go and eat a burger 
R0083,I ordered the duck   it was cold   I mentioned this to the waitress  i was put back on the grill and when was given back to me the chef had put 2 extra bits of duck on my plate   but it was to late i had eaten the veg that had come with it and when it came  back out i wasnt hungry any more   being 5 months pregnant i was really turned off my the idea of been given cold food and then to have it reheated  despite the chef  trying to make up for it by giving me more duck    there was no amendments made to the bill   really bad service in my eyes as we had ordered plenty of drinks and desserts that could have been amended off the  bill   Wouldnt  go back and wouldnt  recommend to friends    my 1st and last visit 
R0083,I really like the atmosphere  service and friendliness of the staff is great  Food menu is limiting   particularly the brunch menu  I dont think its good to only have the brunch menu for saturday lunch  We found it very limiting to pick from 
R0083,"Ive had fish and chips enough times now to know it can be served with the batter not soaked with cooking oil  But alas this is what I got on my visit  The chips were ok  nothing to write home about  There was a huge amount of food on my plate  which was a small plate  This made for hard work cutting into the fish while trying not to knock the rest of the food onto the table  The ketchup was very inferior  I must have left more than half of what was on my plate behind  

The sit down area was a bit depressing too  while the staff did not look to happy to be working there  This did not improve the atmosphere in the place 

I dont see the fuss and I definitely have had better chipper chips elsewhere 

It was an overpriced and disappointing visit "
R0083,"Initially we thought this place looked very promising  and had pretty fair prices so my girlfriend and I came in for dinner  The drinks were the most expensive of all other bars in the area  I had the Rib eye steak my girlfriend had the lobster  Both were OK but nothing to write home about  

What I did not like was that they charged for water  without telling us there was a fee  and same for the bread  Why would they charge for bread  And the fact they dont tell you is quite shady  Lastly they also charge for a service fee  We were not advised nor did we see anything anywhere stating they impose this charge that we have no idea what it was for  No other place we have eaten at charged this BS fee 

"
R0083,It was our second time there and we will be back for many more   Delicious food and great staff  particularly the girl at front of house 
R0083,It was very cold where we were sitting and it impacted on our meal  Couldnt enjoy it as a result 
R0083,Love this place for brunch  This is the go to place for brunch  Always so pleasant and fabulous 
R0083,Lovely decor and great for people watching  Overpriced food and wine
R0083,My first time to visit this restaurant and I was really impressed  Food quality and service were excellent  I would definitely visit again 
R0083,Nice environment and helpful staff  About the food I have been here a few times and they have really good dishes such as the lamb burger  nice spicies and herbs touch and others less tasty  like the salmon dish  I havent try the wide variety of cocktails that they offer but they look amazing  All in all Ill recommend it
R0083,"Nice food  terrible service  Despite trying to get the attention of any staff member  35 mins after being seated our food and drinks orders had not been taken  
Also had to ask for dessert menus twice  
Restaurant wasnt particularly busy to warrant such bad service "
R0083,No the main courses were very poor considering the cost
R0083,Not particularly  Decor is nice but the food was disappointing  We all ordered the poached eggs  avocado and smoke salmon  Really we got two poached eggs and too much bread  Sourdough at that with no other option  All of us were underwhelmed given the nice surroundings 
R0083,OMG   Worst pizza ever  Thin as cardboard  and  tasted like it too    5 tiny pepperoni  so stupid   What a rip off  Irish keep walking    
R0083,"Over priced main courses and the worst cheese board I have ever had in my life  or as you call it ""chesse plate"" it is terrible quality and trying to trick people  Over all poor restaurant  looks like people where more interested in the bar than the food "
R0083,Overpriced pizza and chips   Euro 100 for three pizzas  3 chips and 3 cocktails  No atmosphere in this restaurant at all  Slow table service  Would not recommend
R0083,"Rating this ramen place by Japanese ramen standard will not be fair to The Ramen Bar  �Afterall  this is Ireland and they are not known for good ramen  �Its a bowl of mediocre ramen which if you are craving something asian after getting meat out  then this will be a good alternative  �

This is also the first ramen joint that I have ever given an amuse bouche 

Warning: Do not order the okonomiyaki  I repeat  do not order  �Its the worst okonomiyaki ever  Doughy and basically just all dough and more dough  �This is no way resemble any okonomiyaki I had in Japan  not even close  �Even if it is  it tasted terrible "
R0083,Really great food but you cannot hear yourself  They need some carpet on the floors 
R0083,"Really wasnt impressed by the food  I had the steak and the bernaise sauce did not taste right 
Plus the lemon curd dessert  was almost frozen  the curd was solidified and the meringue on top
was hard  not gooey  It was like a bought in frozen dessert  Really NOT impressed and would not go back 
My friend also was not impressed  her pizza came out with no tomato sauce on it    Unbelievable really "
R0083,"Sadly we had a very poor experience on Sunday evening  Despite the hostess taking 20 percent off the bill  it was not enough to compensate  
Table of 8  5 adults 3 children  Arrived 7 30pm on time  at 8 45 I had to ask for the second time where the food was  We did not order starters so we were nearly 90 minutes waiting on fairly tasteless food 
Would not go back  pity as the room decor is stunning  But definitely a case of style over substance  Hopefully they will sort the kitchen out "
R0083,Second time in here  once for lunch  once for brunch  Decor is fabulous but food is disappointing 
R0083,Second time there and I love it  The food and cocktails were lovely  staff really helpful and friendly and the restaurant itself is gorgeous 
R0083,Service was good  But poor menu  overpriced  Place is nice  They need to work on the menu 
R0083,Service was poor and the cost is on the expensive side  Not be going again
R0083,Slightly odd experience  Rather bored waiter welcomed us and sat us down  �Then disappeared  �Menu was conventional  �Music was far too loud for circumstances and room size  �When I asked him to turn it down so we could talk he made an adjustment that was imperceptible 
R0083,The pizza is super greasy and fake 
R0083,Table location really poor  inside but beside  smoking  terrace exit  Freezing night and door kept blowing open  Food ok but not particularly flavoursome  Service and server good 
R0083,The food literally arrived less than 5 minutes after we ordered it  It was obvious just pre prepared and being kept warm  I find this very disspointing  The food wasnt hot at all  At best luke warm  For the price we paid for what is supposed to be a high quality restaurant I was totally disappointed  
R0083,The food needs work  for the prices being charged the quality in terms of flavour just wasnt good enough 
R0083,The food was the most disappointing food Ive had in quite some time  I got avocado and poached eggs  a dish I get in most places that is hard to not do right but I could not believed when the food arrived how disappointing it was  The service was the only the part that was pleasing about the experience 
R0083,The food was very mediocre and way too expensive  It was very disappointing after reading other very good reviews 
R0083,The food was very plain and my meat was a bit burnt  We have to wait a lot to order because the waiter had a lot of table to look after  The place is beautiful and well located 
R0083,The place is very pricy for the quality of food you are getting  I ordered a salad that is part of their starters and asked to have it as main  They charged me 29 Euro for this salad    The salad turned out to be more expensive than the steak   Had to tell them that this is not sane  and they reduced it by 4 euros  Not to mention that the salad was not impressive at all 
R0083,The restaurant look really nice but the food and ambiance let it down  We were very disappointed and will not be back 
R0083,The restaurant was practically empty  There were three parties of 6 8 people in addition to us  group of 2   Our mains took over an hour to be served  Wed inquired twice and had been told they were coming right out before I actually had to step into the open kitchen and ask for a manager  We were told they delayed firing our mains until we were finished with our starter but our shared starter had been taken away 45 minutes ago   We were ultimately given a modest discount  20 percent   The food was fine but not worth a special trip if you arent already heading in that direction 
R0083,Then the tapas came out   and although we ordered three items which were completely different  they all basically were the exact same thing  Drizzled in the same balsamic vinegar  Lukewarm  The roasted red pepper with goats cheese seemed overcooked and had almost a lazy slab of the cheese sitting in the middle of it   again  not hot  just lukewarm   and the chorizo was tough and tasted like what you could easily buy yourself in Dunnes  Even the chicken failed to make any kind of impression 
R0083,This is my third time and each time has been amazing  The food  the service  the ambiance  everything is top class  I would highly recommend a visit; for food or drink  or both  I will be back    again 
R0083,"Ive had way better pasta for a lot less money 

My husband and I decided to drop in on a Thursday night for pasta  �We were seated right away  

We liked the welcoming atmosphere and quick and attentive service  but the food ranged from just okay to not very good  I wouldnt be so bitter about this had we been at a chain  but when you go to a fairly expensive  well known  family owned restaurant  you tend to be less forgiving and expect more  Especially since its really easy to make delicious pasta  

The best thing we ate was trofie pasta with pancetta  leeks  artichoke  and parmesan  �The pasta was perfectly al dente  and the pancetta was crispy in every bite  However  the dish was missing something  �A rich  creamy sauce and some Italian seasoning could have helped bring it all together  Instead  the sauce  if you even want to call it a sauce   it may have just been drippings from the ingredients  was very watery  �

The tagliolini with beef ragu was borderline unenjoyable  Im sad to say that it was honestly the worst ragu Ive ever had  Ive never had a ragu so flavorless except from maybe a can or jar  A bolognese sauce is so easy to make well  and there is such little prepping involved  Had it had some garlic and spices  it would have been a lot better  

We also split some Campania buffalo mozzarella with peppers and sour dough bread  It was really good  but I cant really give them too much credit for it since all they did was assemble it  

I dont think Id come back or recommend this restaurant "
R0083,"To start  I cant say the team there were anything but friendly and accommodating 
My friend got mediocre steak for  Euro 29 with nothing with it   Any sides are circa  Euro 4/4 50
Another friend got Tortellini that was swimming in butter  Far to much
Our Pizzas were fine but you cant really get Pizza too wrong 
My other friend ordered two starters as a main   For around  Euro 13 a starter they are not worth it 
The brownie is good  the caramel Sunday is a joke   Basically caramel sauce on 3 scoops of vanilla 
What really annoyed us was Parmesan that was put on the table  not requested  and then a charge on the bill for  Euro 1 50
We didnt tip as much because of all of this   Which is unfortunate because the waiter was really friendly 
I wouldnt go back  far more better value  better food venues in Dublin "
R0083,Unfortunately the food was not great   I felt it was too rushed and one dish was undercooked and the other too salty  A few more mins would have made all the difference  Thankfully the staff were very lovely and very apologetic and very kindly comped the meal that was uncooked and a glass of wine which was very lovely and not all restaurants would do that  So that was greatly appreciated  However the issues with the food could be easily rectified at source   just a little more time and less salt   Thank you though 
R0083,"Unfortunately this was not a great meal for me  Ordered the striploin rare and it was just meh  I have had much better in pubs  The peppercorn sauce was extremely bland and i added more table pepper to it to make it taste of anything  My boyfriends meal was just ok too  He had the rump and ribs
 The ribs were good but the rump was just ok "
R0083,Unhelpful  and  unfriendly staff  Food average  Good for insta pics  and  thats it     really disappointed   
R0083,Very much style over substance  5 of us ordered pizzas and all were over cooked and dry  the Parmesan fries had a pool of grease at the end of the bowl and my daughters tempura prawns were soggy as they were coated in a mayo style dressing  Place looks fab and the service is very good but we wont return as the food lets it down  They also need to make the signage for the restrooms more obvious  very hard to find in a wall of mirrors 
R0083,Waiter was extremely rude and unhelpful   ruined the night
R0083,"We booked and still had to wait 30 minutes  with not one person coming up to us or apologising  Then our waitress left her shift and we had no staff for our table for a further 15 minutes  My friend got a glass of Rose but the wine also had what looked like food in it so she sent it back  Then when I ordered the breakfast the toast was BLACK and when I asked different toast they replaced it with a slightly less burned version  All the food was overcooked  the black pudding was Jet black  so overcooked it was unedible  I obviously didnt eat much and they didnt say anything  they really dont care

All in all the staff were rude  the food was overcooked and it is so overrated  Dont waste your money"
R0083,We had a great dinner here  The wine was awesome   recommended by the staff  I wish I remembered what it was   we had a carafe for about 24 Euros  We started off with the chicken Momo  steamed dumplings that were so tasty and well spiced  There were about 12 14 of them   one person could have had them as a meal  �I had the Nepalese vegetable curry  and they customized it to be spicy  and with less potatoes  Awesome  We also got the butter chicken  And Naan  and rice  The food was very tasty  The ambience was excellent  The only thing you should know is that when you sit down  theyll tell you they need the table back by a certain time   in this case 2 hours  The timing was fine with us  The restaurant was busy  and the staff attentive  Definitely check it out 
R0083,We had to ask twice to get our sides after our steaks had been served  Coffee was lukewarm  And greatest sin of all Waiter brought us our bill without warning after we had ordered a 2nd bottle of wine and told us we had 8 mins left 
R0083,We went for the bottomless prosecco brunch  It was great value  and the food was delicious  A really lovely spot  will definitely return 
R0083,We were hugely disappointed with his restaurant  The food arrived cold  We alerted a waiter who was helpful in immediately consulting a manager to arrange for a discounted bill  While we appreciated his efforts he proceeded to deliver us the wrong bill twice 
R0083,"We were really excited to try out this new restaurant and the brunch menu looked amazing  
The venue itself is spacious and nicely decorated with comfortable
Seating  This is about the only positive thing we have to say about this place 
My friend ordered americano and had to send it back as it was just water  Hardly any coffee
In there  The second coffee was brought out but it was exactly the same  My other friend had a latte which was basically just hot milk 
The food didnt fare much better  The pork belly hollandaise: two tiny poached eggs with just a drizzle of hollandaise  served on a dry muffin  It came with home fries which tasted like stale oil  also there were pieces of burger mixed in between  Very very strange  
My other friend had the confit duck potato Rosti  It was horribly soggy and oily and basically inedible  Upon sending this back to the kitchen the manager came to explain the dish is supposed to be like this as confit of duck is fatty  Well  all of us are big fans of duck but never ever was it served like one hot oily mess before  It made us feel very uncomfortable when she tried to convince us otherwise 
In fairness She did offer another dish on the house 
Maybe these guys still have to find their feet but it is certainly not cheap and I really think they have to step up their game serving better tasting food and make the food look more presentable 
None of us will be back "
R0083,We were referred by a friend  When we arrived the place was busy with only 2 people working  We waited over 15 minutes for someone to clean our both no one came so we left 
R0083,"We were sat at a dark table at the very back of the restaurant  The light above the table didnt work so was difficult to even read the menu  We were also right below a speaker so it was uncomfortably loud  We asked to turn down just this speaker  a waiter said he would but then just never came back  It was quite obvious that we were put at this table because we had a small child with us   which I specified when booking 
It is way overpriced  Food was quite nice  but nothing special  especially considering the price  Pizzas are 16 and other mains are 20 without sides  Side dishes are around 4 50  this is way over the odds for a casual dinner 
Our waitress was not very attentive  She actually left the table part way through taking our order and then came back and resumed as if she had never left  Bizarre 
Definitely much better options in this price range nearby with better food and better service "
R0083,"Went here on a Friday evening after a few drinks  we were seated right away without booking or fuss which was very nice  The waiter was polite if a bit rushed despite the place not being very crowded 
Both me and my friend had a cheer burger with Irish cheddar  the meet was juicy  the bread fresh and the cheese nicely melted  all in all a tasty burger  
"
R0083,Went here this evening with my parents  We went for the early bird  The food was ok was expecting better  Wouldnt be back in a hurry  My dad liked his meal though thought it was yum  My mum and I got the gnocchi   wasnt a big fan  The staff were lovely though 
R0083,Went there with the family and I was really disappointed with the quality of the lamb which my mother and I ordered  My mum had to send hers back as it was cold  Mine was ok temperature wise but just didnt taste nice and was very tough 
R0083,"With so many other great Asian eateries out there  my meal in here just left me cold  The duck gyoza were just awful  the dumpling part was cardboard like in texture and the filing was on the gelatinous side   definitely one to be avoided   The chicken yakitori skewers we had also had a strange consistency   they were very tough and stringy   not pleasant at all 

"
R0083,Wonderful experience    The restaurant is beautiful  the food was delicious  the service was excellent  We got lost and they even came looking for us 
R0084,Great looking and tasting food  staff is pleasant  Had a nice  quiet lunch 
R0084,Absolutely beautiful restaurant with fresh  ingredients  a broad choice  lovely staff and a great atmosphere  I would highly recommend it 
R0084,Absolutely loved this little place  The staff is great too  The menu makes choosing difficult which is a good thing �makes you wanna come back 
R0084,Beautiful place  food  great value and lovely staff 
R0084,Been here for first time yesterday but seriously the food did not wow us much   Sorry but cant really see myself come back soon 
R0084,Excellent  friendly service  The live music was a nice touch and never felt intrusive  The food was delicious and dessert was great 
R0084,Food was grand  but they totted the bill up at the table  no printed bill  Realised later they stuck us for 10quid  Not good
R0084,Food was terrible and value for money was poor  Will not return 
R0084,Good was great of course 
R0084,Great food  Great staff  Nice atmosphere  �Would highly recommend it if you are staying in any area of Dublin 
R0084,"I recently visited with a party of 6  I have been there a couple of times before and the food has been lovely and staff friendly  However on this occasion  I was left waiting for my starter for 10 minutes so was eating it when everyone else was finished  my friend was left waiting for her main course for 15 minutes and again got it when everyone else was finished  We also ordered 2 extra sides and eventually got one after we asked 3 times  
This is not acceptable and the restaurant should not  take groups of people if they cannot deal with big orders  I  personally found it very embarrassing as it was a reunion and I was the one that had recommended it and booked it and the other guests were not impressed with the service at all "
R0084,"I think at this stage everyone is familiar with what this place does and believe me: that they do well 
Both our steaks were grilled perfectly to our liking  the wine choices were decent  I only should have picked a different side to go with the steak: I went for truffle mac n cheese and sadly they were just    meh 
The service was great  really friendly without being imposing  its easy to see why this casual restaurant is so popular  "
R0084,Overpriced and felt like the staff just wanted us to leave asap 
R0084,"really nice restaurant  food was perfect  wine was fine and there was a enjoying traditional irish group 

a must to taste restaurant in Dublin"
R0084,Service was very poor and ruined the whole meal  Busy Saturday in the run up to Christmas but no need for staff to be rude
R0084,So delighted to have discovered this gem in our new neighbourhood  Amazing food and wine  Cant wait to go back already
R0084,Starter was reheated cooked prawns with a poorly prepared salad  Main course of lamb was tasty but rice was dry and Luke warm  Deserts were okay  Very average food 
R0084,The cannolo was delicious    
R0084,"The food was good but the service was terrible  We were there on Christmas evening for which we had reservations  They had a limited menu  pre fixed  that evening  various appetizers  5 choices for the main course and various desserts  The mains were chicken kebab  lamb kebab  lamb stew  falafel and a vegetarian stew  It took them an hour to serve us the mains after the appetizers came  We also noticed the two tables who came after us were served before we were  When brought to the servers attention  she said ""what can I do "" I have never been so disappointed  To top it off  the price of the pre fixed dinner is 50 percent more than the price of the food on any other day  I guess they figured  people didnt have other choices that night  might as well charge them more "
R0084,The food was ok  I took Green Eggs and it was very spicy  nothing special  
R0084,The food was very disappointing  I ordered stuffed vine leaves and they were greasy and tasteless  The lamb dish I ordered as a main course was just a bowl of sauce with just a couple of pieces of lamb thrown in  Overall standards have dropped considerably since first I went to this restaurant  what a pity 
R0084,This place was awful with its out of date toilets  served no alcohol and food was awful
R0084,This was a lovely meal  with excellent friendly service from all the staff  Would recommend it 
R0084,Took my teenaged granddaughter and friend while on a visit to Tradfest  They are currently into veganism and adored the food 
R0084,Truly authentic Irish Bar with live music  Great local food and beer  Was there on a Tuesday night  nice to see several musicians on stage
R0084,"VERY reasonably priced Sushi  tucked away in an unassuming corner  

Ive been ordering takeaway from here for a while  my  ehh  kitchen is broken  and theyre always prompt  always friendly and always super tasty 

Great stuff "
R0084,"Very simple but very tasty breakfast  Order and pay out the counter which wasnt obvious 

Delivery to table a bit hit and miss buy cannot beat value and quality "
R0084,Went on staff recommendation and it was tasty  Will visit again
R0084,Why did they change the menu to add pizza pasta etc etc   Pick a limited menu and do it well 
R0084,"With friends we were expecting to have a lovely dinner at your place but unfortunately I need to say that it was a complete disappointment  
The portions were extremely small   especially respect to the high prices  and one of the dished we even needed to send back asking for a replacement cause the meat didnt look fresh at all  The replacement was nice � thanks for that � however it was already quite late to improve the first  bad impression  Furthermore let me tell you  that we expected more authentic taste based on your menu as we had a friend in our company who knew Middle   Eastern dishes pretty well  Last but not least we even needed to remind you to bring back the change after having settled the bill  Please let your guests decide if they want to leave you some tip or not and dont take it granted"
R0085,�The staff was super friendly  and the lattes were delicious  �Id come back 
R0085,All great  It would be helpful to have some vegetable dishes as sides 
R0085,Always great to go for dinner  Never a bad meal or service
R0085,Beautiful food  Great experience
R0085,Delicious naan with the Himalayan curry made for a very memorable meal  Also had the mo mo appetizer which was very good  Excellent quality food and service  Highly recommend this restaurant 
R0085,Dinner and service was superb  Curry was nicest Ive had in a while  will be back for definite  Delightful evening for a group
R0085,Excellent food  They had different dishes compared to the Bangladeshi restaurants and I personally found the Nepalese food to be better 
R0085,Fabulous food   Best Indian we have ever tasted   Staff where lovely
R0085,Fantastic food and service  One of the best chicken bhunas I have ever had  Highly recommend 
R0085,Food was excellent  price was good for such a central location and staff were very attentive
R0085,Food was very nice   just a shame about the service on the night we had been ignored with empty plates for 40 minutes   was offered a complimentary drink at the end as I was handed the card machine which asked if I would like to leave a tip so of course after being offered a complimentary drink I left a generous tip only to be ignored by the waitress after and not receive it   just feel like it was a way of gaining a tip which she didnt actually deserve   as a head chef it irritates me to think that theres a chef working extremely hard in the back to produce extremely nice food and the front of house is damaging his reputation  hats of to the chef but front of house not on the same level
R0085,Great food and service    would highly recommend   Plenty of options and levels of spice clearly indicated
R0085,"I have eaten Indian cuisine all over the world  and it was totally mediocre 
It is probably the first Indian restaurant Ive experienced where the Rogan Josh was completely flavorless    AND the prices were expensive    Would neither recommend or return to this restaurant "
R0085,Its definitely my new go to place for pizza delivery  no more disappointing place place  Wuhooo 
R0085,My daughter booked  and  organised   great staff   super friendly   buffet platters very tasty   had section closed off for us   Great location too 
R0085,"My starter was samosa and tasted rubbery and like it had been microwaved  Main was ok  naan was delicious  
Service was only ok  two other tables that came 15 minutes after us were served before us  Was bumped into while eating by waiter  
Honestly  was disappointed after reading other reviews "
R0085,"Oh wow  wow wow wow  What a find  
"
R0085,"On the run  �And in need of a good sandwich  �Well youll find it right here  �Ive gone here a couple of times  and its simply convenient  �The pricing isnt so bad  and neither is the taste of their sandwiches  �Quite scrumptious if you ask me  �Heres what Ive tried: �

~ The RUBY   Euro 5 50 : �Made with a healthy serving of kanturk pastrami  add some saurkraut  slap on the swiss cheese  glide some horseradish on rye bread and youre golden  �If you order this for breakfast  then you best eat it while its hot  �But also not bad if you plan to save it for lunch  �
~ The HAM and CHEESE   Euro 5 50 : �Made with ham hock slices and grilled gruyere cheese  a couple of tomatoes  some pickles  and all put together between some toasted sour dough  �Cant say its the best hamncheese ever  as most yelpers have mentioned   but it wasnt the worst  �Delish  �
~ Regular Coffee   Euro 2 20 : �Bold and aromatic  �Full flavored  and kept me awake  �Great way to start your day 

I dig it  �Ill be back "
R0085,Poor quality and overpriced food  No sign of fresh ingredients in any of the vegetable dishes  Avoid 
R0085,Service was a disgrace but the food was really good
R0085,The best place for a pizza   Great service and now with the new sitting area is fab   
R0085,This restaurant did not disappoint  �Mussels and Seafood chowder were delicious  �Highly recommended it 
R0085,Two words   cinnamon buns  Delicious sandwiches and soup at great prices  Theres always a queue at lunch  so arrive early 
R0085,We arrived for our reservation  but there was not a table free  We had to wait 30 mins for a table to become free  We stood by the bar  Once we did sit down  the food was delivered The food was okayish  
R0085,Went to this steakhouse a few weeks back  although the table was a little small and we were right next to the downstairs toilet  the food was delicious  The portion sizes are really good   steak cooked to perfection  and  the sides   creamy mash / creamy mushrooms  were delicious  Definitely recommend this place 
R0086,"My second visit to the restaurant and loved it  The food and ambience is lovely 
Would definitely visit again "
R0087,We ate here twice while in Dublin and heard many other people say they had been multiple times  The wings and hummus are great  Also  VERY GOOD steak 
R0087,Excellent pizza place  We had the simple house Margherita pizza and it was delicious  Try the chili oil on the table 
R0087,Excellent service  beef  wine  drinks  and desserts  A perfect meal  You really need to experience this restaurant 
R0087,Family gathering for birthday  very enjoyable  delicious food  nice atmosphere  Will definitely return 
R0087,Great wings and great entertainment on the a Saturday afternoon is not to be missed 
R0087,Have eaten in here a number of times  Never fails to deliver  Lovely staff and delicious food  Will be back 
R0087,Love this place  Great food and service   So handy to have such a great place on our doorstep  Brilliant value too 
R0087,Love this place  The staff are lovely and friendly   The food is always amazing  Strongly recommend 
R0087,Lovely atmosphere  authentic Indian food and great staff and service  Will definitely visit again
R0087,"Mains included a perfectly seasoned and tender steak cooked at the table on a Himalayan salt hot stone  the ""hen pecker"" burger with delicious flavours of sweet maple and peanut butter  and the monkfish burger with a caper and bacon mayo  And the fries  oh the fries  The menu includes a selection of loaded fries  we tried the skin on fries with gravy  bacon salt and mozzarella  and the ""swine fries"" which were sweet potato fries topped with hoisin pulled pork �"
R0087,"My first time to Dublin and my friend told I must visit this place 
Trust me this place is unique 
I like this place would love to visit again "
R0087,Really tremendous food  waiter had a great sense of humour  Lovely wine and amazing food  Great evening for business or pleasure 
R0087,Very friendly and professional staff make you feel very welcome there  Chefs giving real show and food is very good too  I highly recommend it
R0087,We read somewhere that this was the best brunch in Dublin and its possible  I had crab cakes and wife had chicken tacos and both plates where amazing 
R0088,Excellent meal here last Friday  Wed a lovely table upstairs  the food was delicious and staff were all lovely  Will definitely be back 
R0088,Excellent meal with friendly  efficient service  The Chicken Chettinad and Lamb and Potato Karri are particularly good   It is our favourite local restaurant 
R0088,"My wife and I went there on the strength of the reviews  A mistake  The fish chowder was like no chowder we had ever tasted  and weve tasted a few  It must have been thickened with corn starch  and had the consistency of tapioca  What seafood was in it did not seem particularly fresh  The Irish stew was another big disappointment  The meat and vegetables were soft  but there was little flavour  and the stew overall was watery 
The staff was friendly and attentive  and the service was quick  But the food we had was mediocre at best  Dont bother  try somewhere else "
R0088,Spectacularly authentic  Absolutely delicious pizza  Friendly Italian waitstaff  Highly recommend 
R0088,They have free WiFi  which was nice since my wife and I are traveling internationally  Food was great  staff was friendly 
R0088,Very slow service and mediocre food
R0088,"We booked on the app for the same evening  despite showing lots of availability  when we got there they had no awareness of our booking and no table for us  They didnt even have the good grace to be apologetic about it and said �oh but you only made the booking today� as if it was our fault that they werent on top of things  
Customer lost "
R0089,Amazing Malaysian food   so delicious and huge portions  Friendly  attentive staff  We had an amazing time and will definitely be back for a roti canai fix  
R0089,Excellent service and fabulous food   book in advance very difficult to get a table  Great pre theatre option
R0089,The food  service  welcome and everything were absolutely superb   We ate in the Jameson room which was a treat 
R0089,we had a fab eve with friends  Lovely food  All left feeling full and merry
R0090,"A hidden gem 
The food and service was excellent The decor and atmosphere very welcoming We would highly recommend  and we will certainly be back "
R0090,Amazing experience  top food and outstanding service 
R0090,Amazing protein pancakes and coffee  Makes any chain breakfast place
R0090,Best wings in Dublin  Cracking burger too  Very friendly staff 
R0090,Excellent food and excellent service as usual 
R0090,"Fantastic food and superb service 

We had tangiatelle with mushrooms and pesto and pan fried cod 

Recommend this place for great evening "
R0090,Great food  wine  music and service  Would recommend 
R0090,Great steak and Guinness pie topped with gravy and a side of potato salad with mint  � �Nice flavor and best was the thin golden crust 
R0090,I used a voucher at Lavanda restaurant and I was not disapointed  the food was delicious and the staff very pleasant  will be returning 
R0090,Lovely food for kids and adults alike 
R0090,Lovely service  good food and a nice look to the place   would go back 
R0090,Really enjoyable meal  Service was brilliant and the burger was the best in Dublin 
R0090,The burgers were amazing and the sevice was great  I would definitely recommend if you are looking for great food
R0090,"This is my second time and the food has been amazing each time 
Great atmosphere  staff are so friendly and attentive  Would recommend to anyone "
R0091,I made a booking which was accepted by online app only to find when I arrived the restaurant is closed for renovations  Not good enough from both the restaurant and online app  A courtesy call or email explaining  the situation would have been nice
R0091,"The service was dreadful  My friends ordered two glasses of wine which they were waiting for until after our starters came even though they asked for it twice  unfortunately this wasnt the end of our waiting my friends got their mains  and  mine never seemed to appear  I had to go up to the counter twice before I got my curry  and  by the time I got it my friends had finished theirs  
The food was really nice we enjoyed our sushi starter  and  I did enjoy my curry but the service has put me off going back "
R0091,He was too cheap to give my friends and I drinks so he cut us off and wouldnt let it go the entire evening  It completely ruined our St  Pattys weekend because we had been looking forward to this meal and heard there were incredible drinks  To top it off  the meal was remarkable overpriced and each of us spent over  35   for noodles and vegetables  Thanks for the water though  Definitely would not recommend    Im absolutely disappointed 
R0092,"
I understand they get a lot of footfall given the location but as a local   surely theres many other places that you can spend your Euros in  Nicer places  With nicer food  And better overall service  Even the coffee isnt good  
"
R0092, I have never been treated so rudely by front of house staff in all my life  We arrived on time and were asked to wait 15 minutes beside the service area  which we agreed  An extra member had joined our party so I asked if there was any allowances that could have been made  But was told hrashly that the place is too busy and they would not sit the extra person  Rather then leave our friend out we decided to go somewhere else  While leaving the staff member who had been brash towards us followed us out causing a scene saying we would have to pay for the table and that we were being rude  From what I have heard the food here is really good  but I am sad to say I will never be back 
R0092,2 of us had duck which did not appear to be breast  Some of the food eg broccoli was not fresh  As a result we did not have dessert or coffee in case we were further disappointed given the price being charged overall for wine and courses
R0092,Absolutely delicious Brunch menu  Very reasonable prices and a lovely  cool ambience on a hot and sticky Dublin Sunday 
R0092,Always a fabulous meal   Would recommend for lunch or dinner anytime 
R0092,Basic menu for Sunday lunch  Just ok 
R0092,Enjoyed the food  Good service   not rushed no delays  Pleasant staff  Good location 
R0092,Even though the place was not that busy with a lot of staff we were left standing quite a while for attention and when I asked someone about our booking was rudely dismissed  Food was only ok and moderate to high prices  Was very noisy with heavy music 
R0092,"Everything was fine  but thats about it 

I ordered the Green Curry w/ chicken and basmati rice  and a pappadam  It was all kind of bland and the rice was overcooked  

My boyfriend got a tuna wrap that looked ok  but nothing special  Skip it on your travels and eat elsewhere "
R0092,Food and service were good  but the place was so noisy our table of four could not hear each other  We had to strain our voices to be heard  Only because of the noise level I will not be returning  It was a busy night  to be fair  there were two big tables  but still the noise level ruined it for us 
R0092,Food not great and very noisy 
R0092,"Food was average 
Wine was poor quality for the price 
Place was noisy 
Service was OK "
R0092,food was excellent  although long delays  Service was terrible  the waiter appeared not to put our orders in several times  and had to be reminded what we ordered  the meal took forever  which we didnt mind too much  but was as a result of very poor service  We have eaten there before and the service was fine  but this puts me right off 
R0092,"French onion soup was good but brown bread with it didnt really go  The ravioli was very hard at the seams and our waiter joked that it was al dente but it was hard  We replaced it and the next one was over done and mush  Obviously difficult to get right but pasta needs to be thinner 

Pork belly was nice but crackling was disappointing  not crunchy enough  

Staff were ok but one lady waiter was a bit rude  almost knocked me down as I came from the toilets as she barrelled through me  The staff should probably prep their napkins prior to opening so they could give more attention to customers "
R0092,Giving low score for the unwelcoming stance of owner  Lady  coupled by how we were cheated by them  My wife and I had gone to have lunch on 21 April and we ordered two set lunch portions  We werent told that Veg biryani is not included in the set menu while taking the order  We assumed that it is in lieu of the Naan or Rice  But they charged us for three set lunch portions  which is ridiculous  At least  have the courtesy to explain your Menu to your customers 
R0092,Going here for years  Unfortunately prices went up and quality went down  Pity 
R0092,Horrible food and horrible service 
R0092,I booked this table specifically for the great value early bird id Had there before only to be told they had stopped doing the early bird  My friends found their rib eye steak very fatty and the waiter didnt even comment on this when my friend returned her plate with the steak barely eaten and at a cost of  Euro 31  The service was mediocre and it felt like no one really cared 
R0092,"I came here for brunch a couple of months ago and really enjoyed it so decided to give it another go 
Service was slow and we were seated outside  It took us to call a member of staff to come over and take our order  Our food arrived before our drinks and we had to ask again for water 
While sitting outside was nice enough  we were hassled for money a couple of times while trying to eat  No staff presence really made the whole thing feel like we were just put outside out of the way   
The wait staff we interacted with were nice and they declared as we went inside to pay our bill that they were short staffed as someone called in sick which is fair enough  but it affected our experience as a customer  Id reconsider going back but request a table indoors "
R0092,I dont get what all the hype is about  I ordered an omelette with cheese  bacon  and sausage  It came out burned and without sausage  My toast was cold too  Disappointing 
R0092,"I had heard a lot about this Restaurant  and had been there about  20years ago when it was known so my expections were high  and I was disappointed 
"
R0092,I ordered ribeye steak which was just a lump of fat hardly any meat   I asked for ketchup never got it  My friend stood up mid dinner feeling nauseated and had to leave straight away ruining our catch up evening she thinks she got food poising from the prawns she contacted the restaurant but didnt hear anything back yet   I have been to the restaurant on numerous occasions and loved it just dont know what went wrong this evening will be a long time before I go back
R0092,"Its ok  Its middling coffee and one day we went and they had a sign saying they didnt have coffee  How does a coffee place not have coffee 

The toilet seat in this one was also cracked in half  split all the way to through the rim "
R0092,"Just because there is some rice and ""exotic"" vegetable or some raw seafood  it doesnt mean its sushi  It takes years of practice to make a proper rice and when you make a roll it has to be done well  With that being said  the rolls I ordered were not wrapped correctly  It was just a combination between rice and something else  Ramen    Also a huge sigh  I am disappointed that its not a Japanese place but a self claimed Japanese place  This place would be good for people who dont know Asian food well "
R0092,Lovely atmosphere but the food was disappointing  wouldnt return
R0092,My well done steak was charcoal and left a very bad taste  The broccoli was v skimpy for nearly  Euro 5 
R0092,Not a classical dining experience  Very limited choices on menu Service was lacking especially as listed as French dining
R0092,Portion size very small for price  Very slow service 
R0092,Prices have gone up  menu pared back and food is no longer as good as it was  I had a mediocre lamb rump  Our server was extremely rude in pressuring us to leave at 8pm and  when booking slot there was no limit in terms of time  All around us were empty tables  He brought the bill down and stood at the table silently until we made payment  It was previously a favourite spot but no longer   
R0092,Really great service from staff  Wonderful experience 
R0092,Seems to have lost its mojo  Food lovely  staff very nice but overall just feels tired 
R0092,Service was poor  Struggled to get attention  Food was very rushed  and  lukewarm when it arrived  Restaurant was exceptionally noisy  and  rather than try to quiet the large groups  they turned on very loud music instead  Not a pleasant experience 
R0092,Some great  some average and some down right awful  This one is awful 
R0092,Started I had prawn tortellini  it was amazing  Steak even better for main  Highly recommend  Top class 
R0092,"Table was not available at booked time  no where to sit and wait  
Service was poor with ordered vegetables not delivered until asked for  We were not charged for them  
Noise was an issue  Ladies in party did not like mixed toilets "
R0092,"Terrible service and overpriced food; dont go here 

Took 10+ mins to get the attention of the only waitress walking around to clear our table that has food and plates all over it  When I get her attention she laughs and explains that she doesnt really work there  she just used to and today shes helping out  this is confusing as Ive seen her wearing an apron and serving and cleaning   I ask if she can get our table cleared  to which she looks at me as if this is extremely unfair or demanding of us  

The food took 25 minutes to come  despite us deliberately choosing the non vegan pancakes which take less time to make and the restaurant not being extremely busy  We also then have to call the waitress back to remind her we dont have forks  

At this point it becomes clear that our drink order has also been completely forgotten about  as when I asked the waitress where they were she responds with ""you ordered drinks ""  5 minutes later  and a total 40 mins after ordering  our drinks finally arrive  with no explanation or apology for the delay  

I would expect this in a greasy cafe charging super low prices  but we paid  Euro 30 for 2 orders of pancakes and 2 iced teas  Either lower your prices to reflect the customer service  or train your staff  Ive worked in enough restaurants to know that what we experienced was either complete laziness or incompetence "
R0092,"Terrible tourist trap  Im so ashamed that we fell for this  We saw their sign advertising a 3 course dinner with live Irish music and dancing  so we stopped in and purchased tickets a few hours beforehand  We were told dinner times were available for 6  7  or 8pm  We chose 7 and went on our merry way  When we showed up at 7  we discovered that the entertainment didnt begin until 8:30  Talk about being disappointingly early  The timing of the entertainment should have been disclosed ahead of time  
Seating was done on long tables  so we ended up awkwardly smooshed together sharing a meal with other couples while we waited around for the entertainment to begin  The food was decent  but service was very rushed  I had to ask three times for a glass of water  and they gave me a hard time for asking that they wait and not immediately bring out my dessert  Finally 8:30 rolls around and the band starts playing    but the dancers didnt even show up until 9:30  By then we were bored  tired of making small talk with strangers  and sore from sitting in uncomfortable chairs while contorting ourselves to see over peoples heads onto the stage behind us  They literally danced one song and then left the stage for a break  It was awful  We left early "
R0092,The drinking glasses for the water were dirty  My friend found a hair in her food and my other friend found meat in her salad  We sent one dish back but didnt mention the other incidents because we didnt want to make a fuss  Ive been before and really enjoyed the food although I always find the service challenging    its always difficult to get servers attention  but the food is usually good and good value for money  However this time was disappointing  and  embarrassing as my friends were in town for the weekend  and  I picked this restaurant but soon regretted it  Maybe they were just having a bad day     
R0092,The food was excellent  the service great  however the evening was spoilt by the loud music and the extreme noise  shouting singing from your other patrons
R0092,"The worst thing about this place is the service  We had to practically beg to get the waiters attention and I had to go to the bar myself a couple of times when I needed something because the waiter wouldnt come no matter how many times I wave or call him even though the restaurant was pretty empty at the time 
I should have read the reviews first because Im not the only one with the complaint about the service"
R0092,The service was to forceful not welcoming or friendly the table next to the toilets was terrible should have been half screened off  Waitress not that friendly  Waiter eating chips left on the kitchen counter not drafty position of table to large outside door not a great experience at all generally the food was OK steak was stringey and knife blunt   
R0092,Unfortunately the service was very poor and our table couldnt hear eachother or chat  It was my dads birthday and we wanted a special night but it was far from it  Really disappointed and the service was really slow and Forgot about us quite a lot  The pork belly was very fatty and the soup wasnt great  I dont think Id be back or recommend it  Really sorry to give negative feedback 
R0092,"Used to come here all the time when I was younger but the last visit left �a lot to be desired  Dare I say the most over priced restaurant in Ranelagh  �They lure you in with the wings  which were only ok btw  and then absolutely sting you with the price  I ordered a burger thinking it was going to change my life for over 15 euro  It did change my life bu tonly in the sense that I was now 15 euro lighter and had a sense of being slightly cheated as when I said i was fine without the fries I was told ""well they come with it anyway"" and not offered an alternative  I have a bit of nostalgia for this place but I think Ill leave it at that  Never meet your heroes  again  "
R0092,Very friendly staff  good menu and the food was excellent  Wine list a bit on the pricey side for good French wine 
R0092,Very nice staff
R0092,"Very nice staff  great food  great buzz 
I would recommend brunch here  a lovely varied menu  Great people watching opportunities too "
R0092,Waiter was so rude it made for a very negative experience
R0092,"We have been frequent visitors over the past few years  On this occasion we hadnt been for about a year which was unusual for us  We were a party of 4 people  The starters were all delicious  We had a problem with the main courses  All four of us ordered Rib Eye steaks  Two rib eyes were nothing but fat  One worse than the other  We politely told our waitress this and she took away the dishes and the other two continued having their main courses  We could see the chef behind us very dramatically complaining about us saying the steaks were bad  The waitress came over and did say I know one of the steaks was very bad and they accepted that but you ""do know rib eye is a type of steak that has fat on it "" Of course we know Rib Eyes have fat on them  We are familiar with them  In her defence we could see she was sent by the chef to say this  The steaks came again and once again one steak was awful  She knew when she took the plates back  We didnt complain and she eventually took one off the menu  Between 4 of us we spent 370 euros on the bill  This was a huge amount to us  and Im sure for anyone  and to leave really  really  disappointed I think it was a disgrace 

 We wont be back again "
R0092,"We were left waiting before we ordered for a very long time  over half an hour  We ordered rib eyes and they werent good at all  The price of one taken off the bill  
Cheese boards werent good either  Overall disappointing as this used to be a great restaurant "
R0092,We were sited at the bar in the middle of the kitchen  with all the cooking smells and waiters bumping into our stools everytime they were coming to pick up dishes  I dont even understand how they can sit people there  We complained and after a while were moved to another spot 
R0092,Went for brunch last Sunday  Staff could give a damn to be honest  From the manager to wait staff  not one of them gave the impression they wanted to be there or assist in any way  Far too cool to smile or acknowledge my existence  Food was fine but I wont be returning 
R0092,Went on a Sunday evening at 7pm  Restaurant did not have many guests but the music was pumping  and was like eating in a nightclub  If you are looking for a nice relaxing meal and a catch up with old friends  do not eat here  No reason to force guests to shout over the music to be heard 
R0092,While the service was good  the food was over priced ordered the rack of lamb for 29 Euro and I got two very small chips  They were cold 
R0092,Whopper  Staff were very sound  even gave us a free desert  Lovely atmosphere will definately be back 
R0092,"Worst take away I have had in a very long time 
Arrived after 50 minutes  When I called to check on the delivery  the person who answered the phone told me the delivery had gone out before I had even told him who I was 
When it arrived  the onion bhaji were cold and very greasy 
the Butter Masala Chicken was sickly sweet and one of the worst things I have ever tasted  Definitely not made fresh  
the poppadoms were stale  and the onion chutney that came with it was not fresh either  The naan bread was very doughy and I had requested a garlic coriander naan through just eat ie but the driver informed me that if I request that I should say that I will pay the driver the extra   as I had paid by laser beforehand   A quick phone call to me before the order was prepared and I would have agreed to this  Euro 1 extra with no problem 
the can of club orange I got was at room temperature 
Worst customer service ever to match the worst food ever"
R0093," I have to admit  was perhaps the biggest disappointment in Dublin 

When I went there I was looking for something quick so I ordered the hummus  caramelized red onion toast  First the toast took arround 20m to be made and once I tasted it the bread was completely cold  As for the taste  sadly  the only thing with flavour was actually the caramelized red onion  and I was so looking forward for the hummus   
I also had a lemonade and that was well done 
Looking at the menu the prices seemed pretty reasonable
The place itself has good decoration but it was a bit chilly and the music on the background didnt fit the space 
A couple arrived 2m minutes after us and it was only we were leaving that they finally received their meal 
Maybe it was just a bad day but I didnt feel like coming again "
R0093,Ate here the other night with my wife   The food was bland and with not much flavor   The special was intended to have a spicy flavor but was just like eating tomato paste   Service was slow as they need to hire more staff   Location is nice as well as the atmosphere but not recommended 
R0093,Beautiful decor and wonderful atmosphere  Service good but food average  Good for a group meal and the live musician was a nice touch 
R0093,Disappointed  Waiter was surprisingly  unfriendly  verging on rude and spilled red wine on me after whizzing it around over vigorously in the glass  Realised why in the end   12 5 percent service charge included  so must have felt there was no need to be polite   Wont be going back 
R0093,"Good food  bad service 
Need to improve customer service  dont make your clients rush out of the door "
R0093,Great food and excellent service  Highly recommend it
R0093,Great food  great service and an amazing location  Perfect brunch 
R0093,Great value and excellent server   Jamaican fellow was excellent 
R0093,I have been to this place four tines and have kept going back because the food had always been fantastic  However very disappointed by food on this occasion  Burrata starter was very poor and I love Burrata  Antipasti meat was �ok  Steaks for main were �ok  Risotto was very poor  Overall very disappointing based on last experiences  The waiting staff were excellent 
R0093,"I love good burgers  and the first time Ive been here I saw this guy sitting in a table near me ordering the burger
It looked so good
I was full at that time
So I came back to try it
I honestly say
It was very disappointing  
Dry bun
Over cooked patty
Too much sauce 
The only reason Im giving them two stars is because the fries were good and the juice was really refreshing 
I had elderflower with mint  so good "
R0093,"I really wanted to like this place  Im a bit of a brunch fanatic and I live in the area so I was excited at the prospect of a new place to go  Unfortunately the food was probably the worst brunch Ive ever had  I had the taco bowl which came swimming in so much liquid the bowl was soggy by the time it got to me  and overall just lacked flavour a key theme for this place  
My girlfriend had there eggs Benedict  which was an absolute cat crash  It came served in a croissant which is just a terrible idea  it was ham hoc rather than plane ham  a poor attempt to be trendy in my opinion and the hollandaise was split "
R0093,"I visited this place for the first time on Saturday evening with two old friends   The restaurant is beautiful and the candlelight ambience is perfect   The music is subtle and funky and all the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful     On entering the restaurant we were greeted by the lovely pizza oven only to be informed that pizza is only available on the early bird menu     We continued to be disappointed  with the menu  a very limited offering   On being served  the food was a beautifully prepared and delicious  clearly with top quality ingredients but  alas   the portion sizes were so small it really made us feel we were being overcharged   
 Top marks for ambience  staff  service and experience    Lovely digestivo on the house before we left  Overall we had a great time but dont think I would return    sorry "
R0093,I would rate 5 star for everything but we were sat beside the Micros and cutlery drawer  Unfortunately 2 glasses were broken from the suspended glass rack and audible cursing could be heard from the gentleman  I assume bartender/bar manager  I didnt catch his name   Both servers were very friendly and nice  specials were explained in a clear manner as were the desserts  I rate it so low because it took 15 mins for the starters to be cleared after we were finished  And once we received our mains our water glasses remained empty until we moved upstairs  We were in no rush  I didnt mind  this is just feedback  We both loved the food  and I cant stress how lovely the staff were  just service was a little slow  I look forward to coming back 
R0093,"Ive been here a good few times as its close to work so its handy for lunch  Ive not reviewed before as the food is OK but today  awful  

I decided to go for the nasi goreng  Id normally avoid this kind of thing on a pub grub menu but the curry is good so assumed this might be on par  I was mistaken  firstly the potion size is small for the price in comparison to almost all of the other dishes  Second  the egg on top looked like it was a pre cooked one left over from breakfast so there was no hope of a runny yoke creating a sauce  Third  the chicken was soooooo dry it was difficult to swallow and finally the body of the dish tasted and had the texture of a microwavable packet of rice  

I ate all of it  �I was starving  Now it wasnt horrible but as described above means it was edible but anyone who can fry an egg would have done just as good a job  

Keep clear of this dish at all costs  Go for the wings  always go for the wings  

Im sure Ill be back but only as its convient not by choice "
R0093,Please save the innocent people of Dublin from this horrible sad excuse of a restaurant 
R0093,It was boiling hot  Staff were just ok  White wine came out warm  Mains were very small 
R0093,Its a nice place but we were very disappointed with the starters  no value for money  I had the goat cheese salad  to much rocket leaves very little goat cheese  was almost bitter taste to it  Any homemade goat cheese salad will taste better  The other starter was a Caprese salad  we were looking for the pesto     main courses were nice but  Euro 19 for pasta with mushrooms was a bit pricey for what it is  Will not go there again 
R0093,Just dreadful  No pizza for starters   and apparently not the first time this has happened  Very poor early bird selection   like an 80s menu choice for Italian restaurants  e g  Meatball linguini   Ordered steak  but no  they had run out  Prosecco was so flat it didnt have one bubble  they changed free of charge   Aperol Spritz had one thimbleful of Aperol  I couldnt wait to leave  Server  Aldo  was a nice guy so not blaming him  I could go on     and talk about the food which had a few issues   Only highlight was dessert which looked like it was pre prepared  so maybe someone else and not the kitchen   Never again 
R0093,Left disappointed  Felt the cost was very over priced for what we got  Selection of starters  lasagna with no sides  3 scoops of sorbet was  I think   Euro 45  I think because the menu didnt have prices on it  Also   I went here because Id checked out the menu and  as we had a picky teenager with us  thought their Pizzas would cater for her  Was told when we sat down it was a set Christmas menu and no pizzas available  Am ok wth set menus  but advance warning would have been nice  Wouldnt go back and wouldnt recomend it  Over priced for what it is/was 
R0093,Love this place  Very authentically Italian  great food  very good value set brunch menu  Try the rhubarb Panna Cotta  its amazing 
R0093,Loved it  It was our first time there   Staff so helpful and friendly   Will definitely be back 
R0093,Most enjoyable evening  staff very friendly and efficient  Food most enjoyable  altogether a very pleasant evening 
R0093,My husband and I dined here for a special occasion  The food and wine were great and the service was good  It has a nice interior and good facilities  One major problem though was that the music was not in keeping with the style of the place and the volume was way too loud  My husband suggested it was like eating dinner in a disco bar  Diners next to us asked for it to be turned down but unfortunately it didnt really make a difference  It was a pity as it ruined what would have otherwise been a really nice meal  I would like to return but only if they change the playlist and keep the volume lower 
R0093,"Ordered fillet steak came cooked wrong 
Mushrooms not cleaned properly had grit in them "
R0093,"I didnt have time to even eat the breakfast  Had I know it would have taken a long time I would not have ordered 

I will not be returning again"
R0093,"Portion sizes very small for the main  I got a starter and a main and I was hungry when I left  
Expensive for a small amount of food "
R0093,Really enjoyable night in a relaxing setting with friendly and helpful staff  Food was top drawer
R0093,Rude and intimidating staff  I ended up leaving before we ordered 
R0093,Second time there wonderful service and food really enjoyable night highly recommend
R0093,"Service was slow  we were left waiting with no drinks and we had to call for attention  
Food was OK  I had fillet steak that was apparently an 8oz cooked med  It was seriously tiny  If I had it well done there would not be much left on the plate  Also it had melted cheese on top but nowhere on the menu did it say cheese was to be served with it  
The sea bass was delicious  
To be honest I was a bit disappointed with the whole experience  
Lovely place but food and service on this occasion wasnt up to scratch "
R0093,Terrible  Staff were rude when we asked to move the table  as the bar hung over the table preventing us from sitting down    Waited ages to give our drinks order  and food took even longer  Heard another couple complain and leave  should have taken this as a warning  Fire alarm went off multiple times  We were then told the kitchen had a problem and we could only have starters  Then told it was fine  Then told it was still closed  Very unclear and stressful situation and never a proper apology from the manager  We ordered deserts  as we were starving   which were terrible  avoid the tiramisu and miniature cheese board  We were then told the deserts were cancelled and we were getting main courses  however it was far to late  we had to leave  this was over an hour since we arrived  so we insisted on just the deserts and left  We werent charged for the food  but managers and wait staff never apologised to us as we left  just stood there watching us go  Stressful  uncomfortable and unfriendly  wouldnt return  
R0093,"That was one of the worst experience I had in any restaurant in Dublin  The manager was telling us that we were not on time while actually we were before time  they didnt mention to me that we have to leave the table just after 1h45 min  while I mentioned during the reservation that its going to be my husbands birthday  The were trying to take the order very quickly punting a pressure on us  And then when I went to talk to him he was very rude and he told me that this is the usual everywhere and the customer has to leave the table after 1h45min  even if there is an occasion to celebrate  I told him that he is behaving very bad and I have never been treated like that in any restaurant before and he replied  to me : ""There is a first time to everything""  Then he came to our table to say that we cannot stay if we dont leave the table on time""  So we left very disappointed  We will never go back there and Ill make to let everyone know about how rude and impolite the manager and the waitress working there they are  Its a shame      "
R0093,The portion of pasta was very small for the price  it was quite expensive and was charged  Euro 4 50 for some bread  I thought the value of the meal was very bad but other than that the service was very good
R0093,The service was absolutely fantastic  The food was amazing and match the time that weve finished the starters  that was awesome  I do recomend this place 
R0093,"The service was so bad  Incredible  The waiter was more interested in looking cool in front of his friends who were eating a fewctabjes away from us  The waiter slammed plates in the tables   leaned across us to get bread etc instead of taking a few steps to reach   major delays between courses as a result of him just not being there half the time  
I was so disappointed as I recommended this place as a place to eat  He didnt even want to take my order  Wasngt listening  Not happy at all"
R0093,The space was cramped  the food was tasteless and rushed   we wont be back 
R0093,The venue and ambience is fabulous  The food on the night we dined was limited in choice and rather inoffensive  Needed more options
R0093,This place gets packed    And we came on a Tuesday night so I imagine weekends are even busier  This must be a good sign that the food is good  Unfortunately we did not get to try any  We waited and waited and had a couple beers and by the time we finally got a table and ordered food  30 minutes went by and the waitress came back and said she forgot to put our order in  So we left  Really disappointed
R0093,This place is disgusting  As a restaurant they have a terrible attitude among people of different walks of life and condone animal suffering  Would never ever eat there
R0093,Too expensive  small portions and they tried to cheat us on 12 5 percent service charge that wasnt written anywhere 
R0093,"Twice now I have partaken in the fare from this  

Twice Ive had a snack box 

Twice Ive been disappointed by the chicken  It was salty annd a little undercooked in some pieces on my most recent trip  

The chips are fine /  not the best but not the worst but the chicken really let it down  

I wont be venturing in again with good places not much further away and offering much much better food  in my humble opinion "
R0093,Unfortunately we did not have a good experience  My friend ordered the chicken and it was raw  as in still translucent  in the middle  Our table was not great either as it was right as you come in the main entrance in the middle of the room  they did acknowledge it wasnt a great table but they had nothing else  It felt like the staff were distracted by a big group they were catering for upstairs so the restaurant suffered as a result  raw chicken however cannot be excused
R0093,Was really disappointed with the overall experience  The bar upstairs is lovely but barman wasnt very friendly  Restaurant downstairs was smelling of sewage  Maybe because its a basement but not very nice when eating  Dinner was nice but gave back dessert as there was no taste off it at all   Very pricey for an ok meal  Nothing special here at all 
R0093,We had an amazing evening  The atmosphere  food  and service was out of this world  Highly recommend and well be back   Thank you
R0093,"We had made reservations over a week ago for 8 pm Easter Sunday  My son and his girlfriend preceded us into the restaurant  were seated  and immediately the waiter asked them our whereabouts  My son told him we were parking and will follow shortly  ""Well  we are closing soon""  replies the waiter  My wife and I arrived two minutes later  took our seats  and our son told us of the exchange  When the waiter came over we asked if it were true  ""Yes  The kitchen is closing in 15 minutes "" Seriously  Was that information posted on The restaurants website  Did anyone give us the information when we initially made the reservation  Not at all  We decided to skip dinner rather than be timed and shooed out the door  As we got up to leave we were followed with a snotty comment by the waiter   Im sure the owner will be delighted to know how the business is being run "
R0093,"We ordered delivery   two starters and two mains for 30 50 EUR inc delivery 

The garlic bread was ok  The chicken wings were ok  but the sauce was no where near how the menu described them: ""served in our famous hot sauce""  The sauce was sweet if anything  but not spicy in any way  




"
R0093,We went for a celebration meal and were disappointed the minute we arrived as the restaurant was very quiet yet we were placed at possibly the worst table in the whole place   on top of another couple squished against a wall   it was as if the restaurant was packed and they tried to squeeze us in yet there was only about 4 customers there at the time  We thought maybe as we were only 21 they noticed we were younger and maybe they thought it wouldnt bother us or we wouldnt say anything if we placed at the worst table  We then kindly asked to be moved as we could see even the couple beside us were uncomfortable / surprised with us being placed so close  After we were reluctantly placed at another table  we were then ignored and not even offered a drink for at least 10 minutes   and its not as if the restaurant was busy  After this we were told there was an issue in the kitchen   which after reading other reviews we learned this was not a first and happened often   and even still we werent even told about these issues for around 15 minutes  We then ordered food   still felt rudely treated though  Food was tasty no complaints there 
R0093,"We went for a meal on Saturday Evening I had booked for 7 30pm   When I booked there was never any mention of the table having to be returned 

However when we were there we had our starters  and  mains and we were looking forward to dessert  the waiter who was very good I must say had overheard me mention it was someones birthday  and  he brought over a cake as we were about to have dessert  however he then proceeds to tell us they needed the table back  and  we could not have dessert or wine or tea or coffee  not impressed to say the least  we never would of gone there if we had of known this   It really put a dampener on the night 

In the end he said we could stay but the damage was done 

We left a tip as the waiter was very good  but I would not recommend to anyone  None of us had been before and  we were so looking forward to it but needless to say we were left with a sour taste in our mouths "
R0093,"We were really excited about the dishes displayed on the menu  but they did not look as good as you would picture them on your mind  We had for starter the antipasti  which was actually really good and Id say was what ""saved"" the dinner  

I had the special of fish with green beans and herbed potatoes  The green beans were undercooked which made the texture difficult to enjoy  The fish was good  and the potatoes were  kind of bland  My girlfriend ordered the gnochetti with shiitake mushrooms  clams and mussels  When we saw the plate we both said ""well  that looks unappetizing""  Some of the mussels were completely closed  which means that they were not properly cooked  and the gnocchi were pretty dry 

Aside from the not so good experience with the food  the waiters  did not seem to understand what we said  given that we had to request the bill 3 times  and we had to wait 15 minutes to pay 

Overall  a poor experience  I would not go back  nor recommend to other people "
R0093,Went to Celebrate two birthdays  food  and  service was amazing  Very accommodating for every request 
R0094,after having my booking confirmed with online app that day  I booked a taxi and arrived at 8pm for a birthday treat for my daughter  at reception was told I had no booking and could not have booked it that day  we left disappointed and had to wait outside in the cold for 20 mins to get a taxi back to our hotel  birthday completely ruined    
R0094,"Average food  average service  waitress tricked us into purchasing bottled water when we asked for glasses of water  I wasnt aware we had to specify we wanted it from the tap  

The vegetarian options arent great  very bland and boring  Food is expensive for what you end up getting on the plate too  

The waitress was also very much on top of us for our whole meal  and not in a friendly way  so it was just weird  I wouldnt even put it down to being that they needed the table and wanted us out of there quick  as we went on midweek around 5pm  and the place was empty bar one other table of 2 

I wouldnt be rushing back to this place  but if I had no other options  Id probably return "
R0094,Awesome food   Awesome Whiskey and Beer selection  Fun live music       Awesome staff    Will be back here    Love it 
R0094,Came here as it was open late and located right across the street from where we were staying at in Dublin  While I enjoyed the pasta I got  prawn spaghetti   my boyfriend thought his pizza tasted like cardboard  However  I was still enjoying our first dining experience ever in Ireland up until it was time to pay the bill  At the counter  our server intentionally charged us more for our main courses despite having verbally confirmed our items just seconds earlier  so I know she didnt get our items confused with someone elses  She charged me an extra Euro for the pizza   Euro 12 90 instead of  Euro 11 90   and then charged me for the risotto instead of the pasta which costs an additional Euro and then overcharged by an extra Euro on top of that   Euro 17 90 instead of  Euro 15 90   I immediately noticed this because I remembered the prices off the top of my head but did not want to call her out on it in case that was the norm in Ireland  After researching back at the hotel and seeing that it wasnt  I wrote it off as the gratuity we would have given her anyway and figured we would write a review to warn tourists to CHECK THEIR BILL  as they try to slyly upcharge 
R0094,Food is good but service could be better felt like we were rushed out of the restaurant well before closing time at 11pm  We were sitting at our table at 10 15 when the manager started to dim down the lights and take things off the table in a frantic rush and hint to us to move on  Never any option to pay by card here only cash  We have been here on numerous occasions where the staff used the excuse of the card machine not working  So you have to go to the shop up the street to get money from the atm
R0094,I got the beef burrito    it really was one of the worst burritos Ive ever had    The meat was the toughest and chewiest of meats    like Im sure rubber would be easier to chew    it was so dry as well    Not just the meat but the whole burrito    
R0094,left it too long to call back but  it was worth the wait  will call back again 
R0094,"Lots of interesting choices  Very extensive drink menu
Rotisserie duck was really good as well as the smoked mackerel salad"
R0094,One of the most decent Chinese takeaways in the area  The bread samosa is a delight   So is the Ma Po Tofu and the Chilli tofu 
R0094,Really good tasting  fresh homemade food  Very friendly staff  Good atmosphere  local restaurant  Great value  Ill definitely be back 
R0094,Rosies seems popular with tourists and locals alike  The breakfast options are solid if not spectacular   though I do feel the 10 euro price is a bit steep  
R0094,The service was lovely  the waitresses were welcoming and attentive  Having lived in Italy for the past 7 years I found the pizza lacked authenticity  quite greasy for my personal liking  I thought it was slightly over priced  It was convenient as we were visiting the gaol beforehand but I wouldnt go again 
R0094,This please dose amazing food  myself an friends always meet up here for food  staff are always friendly and helpful with choices  love love love to eat here
R0094,"Totally satisfied   Great menu choices with a family run atmosphere   
Next time in Dublin  we will return "
R0094,We were not made aware until after the fact that credit cards are not accepted   We had to run to a gas station to get cash  kind of a letdown 
R0094,"What a great place we went as a large group for a birthday and it was exceptional 
The food was amazing and it was only made better by the service 
Go  you wont be disappointed "
R0095,Very nice meal  Friendly service  Pizza was a highlight  Well definitely go back

R0096,Delicious shrimp risotto  �Snug and friendly  Owner has great sense of humor  Recommend highly

R0096,Great  as always
R0096,I havent been to  for a while but I wont wait so long to return again  Really delicious food and super service 
R0096,I was there on Sunday and they have reduced the cost from  Euro 6 50 to  Euro 5 99  �Great special offer for a full meal 
R0096,Just a terrific restaurant brilliant staff  food  wine  furnishings and ambience 
R0096,Unfortunately the service was disappointing on this occasion  When we were getting our main courses the waiter asked my friend did she order a main course even though he was the one who had taken her main course order already  She eventually got hers 20 minutes later  We also ordered coffees that were forgotten about 
R0096,Love this restaurant  Amazing value for money   Perfect little French restaurant  Beautiful French ambiance 
R0096,Pate sampler is great  Wine good and decent value for money
R0096,perfectly orchestrated playlist  lovely warm staff  good food  a little expensive but it feels nice to be there  will definitely go back 
R0096,Poor table at open door  freezing  Items not available on menu were not explained  Rose wine ordered but white presented  Sparkling water mixed brands poured  Asked for jug of iced water 4 times and eventually received a glass of ice  Salt cellar not working  replaced but that also didnt work    Food ok but my company had the duck ragout but there was just a bowl of beans  Have eaten here before and have enjoyed but this experience was very poor  Seemed that staff struggled with volume of customers   
R0096,Such a nice experience  delicious food  superb  and  friendly service 
R0096,Superb meal
R0096,The food was amazing  Staff was very friendly and attentive  We had a great evening here 
R0096,There was only ever going to be one place for a 40th birthday celebration and as always this place was perfect
R0096,This is a great local eatery and a great place for breakfast  Fresh produce and great coffee  a must for lazy Sunday mornings 
R0096,Very Good 
R0096,We had a fantastic meal and are already looking forward to returning   Id highly recommend it 
R0096,We had a super family evening 
R0096,We had the rib of beef to share   it was huge and amazing 
R0096,When I travel to Dublin  I always make sure to dinehere  The quality of food  the ambiance  and excellent service make it a special place 
R0097, One of my favorite places to go to for there huge size portion of wings  Good service  Usually always quite busy  Sometimes hard to get a table  And the nachos are good to have sent them back a few times as they havent put enough cheese on them even when I ask for extra cheese 
R0097,A charming small restaurant around the corner from our hotel  this restaurant shows the value and ethnic variety that Dublin offers 
R0097,Beautiful refurb  Very welcoming staff  Mant thanks
R0097,Food was delicious  but took forever to refill the food trays  Staff were friendly  nice atmosphere and definitely would go back again
R0097,"Great food and atmosphere down in an old brick lined storage bunker underground  �Fun bar tenders and drinks upstairs before dinner 
The service was outstanding "
R0097,Great steak  beers and the service was good  And with the collage next door great atmosphere
R0097,Our server Victoria was super friendly and attentive to all of our needs  The food was delicious but we would have preferred more savory dishes
R0097,Service was very quick  Biggest Irish Breakfast Ive had in Ireland  Quality was Good  Thick Bacon rashers  large sausages 
R0097,We had an absolutely wonderful afternoon tea  The service was amazing  Would do it again  Just be aware that they only do tea Friday to Sunday 
R0097,Worth a trip  The steak is as good as everyone says and is it be of the better meals I had while in Ireland 
R0098,As always a wonderful experience  Fantastic service and food  Well able to handle a coeliac diner with no issues  Our favourite neighbourhood restaurant 
R0098,"Breakfast in this bistro en route a brisk morning walk  I would call it upper class breakky everything was posher than normal 
Also beans are amazing "
R0098,Disappointing  totally overrated  no recommendation
R0098,Fantastic  Would definitely return
R0098,Gorgeous little restaurant with great food and lovely staff  well be back
R0098,Great experience  Best new restaurant found for long time  A must if you visit Dublin 
R0098,Great food  nice and humor boss 
R0098,Great little spot   Went there with a large group of 8 of us on Saturday for a three course meal and was very impressed  I ordered the salt and pepper calamari for starter and it was superb  the batter was light but very fragrant with spices in it  probably the nicest calamari Iv had and not at all greasy  I ordered the duck for mains which came with red cabbage and fondant potatoe  this was very tasty although I would have had the fish special but it was all gone by our 8 oclock seating  Finally I ordered the Nutella brioche bread and putting pudding which was to die for  A lot of our table were very displeased that there were no chocolate brownies left by the time we ordered desert  but my first choice was there so I was happy out  The food quality is great and the service was good too  Tried the chicken wings which were lovely also 
R0098,"Great place for brunch   amazing food   
We had Chorizo Benedict and Bacon French Toast 
Great service   lovely staff"
R0098,Great spot for brunch and now open for dinner as well  Very tasty food and nice coffee  Friendly and helpful staff 
R0098,I enjoyed the chicken dish and my friend loved the gnocchi  �I would return for lunch or if traveling solo for business 
R0098,If I had the option of no stars I would do so  The only thing going for it is the fact I didnt get food poisoning 
R0098,It has very tasty coffee and a variety of healthy sandwiches  and  juices  They also do good brownies gluten  and  sugar free 
R0098,Loved the burgers here and the fact you can basically compose your burger  Cool place also with the murales and the dj  The service is very basic but thats the style of the place and I like it 
R0098,Lovely little place
R0098,"Perfect place to watch a game  any game  �Lots of TV so you cant miss a thing 
Excellent craft beer selection  very friendly bar staff "
R0098,Pleasant restaurant situated just outside Dublin City centre  Good menu and opportunities to choose from specials board  Worth considering if in the area 
R0098,Really enjoyed it 
R0098,Really nice new pub   Cosy atmosphere  excellent service and delicious food  Staff are all very friendly  Couldnt reccommend more
R0098,So pleased we checked this out on internet rated no 1   Lovely hidden little gem food was lovely  service perfect lovely atmosphere  would  definitely recommended 
R0098,The food was amazing and so was the host  Thank you  we had a great time
R0098,This is one of my favorite restaurants in Dublin  The food is superb with a wide and varied wine list  Above all    the service is outstanding 
R0098,"This is the kind of place youd dream of if you were looking to open your own wee cafe  Such a wonderful location  great friendly staff  super tasty variety of foody stuffs with unbeliveable desserts and coffee 
I had the pulled pork  apple slaw with an incredible tangy relish  Honestly  I wasnt even that hungry and yet I was practically licking the plate   Our party of three shared the chocolate cake which was decadent  moist and most importantly full of chocolate 
They have a grest facebook page btw  "
R0098,Today was my first time here and I must say I really enjoyed it   The food and atmosphere was flawless   
R0098,Unfortunately we were most disappointed with the quality of the food despite the excellent reviews which we went on  The waiter and chef were lovely people   so personable  helpful and engaging  However the food was far from good but we chose not to comment at the time as it was evident the staff were trying hard to please 
R0098,Very cosy and friendly place  Food very tasty and portions generous 
R0098,Very dated decor with smell of stake cooking oil  Some of the food was actually reasonable and waiter was very nice
R0098,We had a lovely meal with excellent service  Great value for money and the food was delicious 
R0098,Went for my birthday and it exceeded our expectations  tasty authentic food and great service
R0099,Great Red wines  at least what I have tried 
R0099,Absolutely horrendous  We were excited to try a new place in Ranelagh but yet again having tried a number of the press up venues we were disappointed again    The service was horrendous in here  the manager/main employee directing people around was appalling  Especially when I heard her give out about staff right beside me  mentioning there names and funny enough she was was wrong the people she mentioned were more accommodating then some of the staff running around  Some didnt even know the menu and yes they were Restuarant employees  Is this always going to be a service by the press up company    Its not acceptable  Support your staff  train your staff and you will see the results in house  Im not speaking for one person  Im talking for a multiple of ppl having experienced this service  
R0099,"Avoid until late 2019 at least  
Went for brunch with my girlfriend Saturday 17/NOV/2018  The place is new but you could tell the staff werent all up to speed 

Wait staff were prompt when queried  drink service was excellent   But food    I ordered sausage and black pudding eggs benedict  with hollandaise sauce on the side   My partner ordered waffles and chicken  Took 40minutes from ordering until our food arrived  We sat near the kitchen and could hear the panic and complaints over how slow it was  Also heard other tables complaining of slow slow service 

When our food arrived mine was covered in hollandaise and the waffles were burnt  Black burnt waffles should never have been given to a customer  So floor staff are not innocent  Teething issues I really really hope "
R0099,Beautiful setting  very attentive service  gorgeous brunch  I look forward to my next visit
R0099,"Booked our table for 2 a week in advance of our Thursday evening visit  Disappointed to get what must be the worst table in the house  nearest the kitchen  each time the door opened there was a rush of wind through so we were cold and uncomfortable  I suspect closing the doors to the outside area could help enormously here   Overattentive waiting staff   while pleasant  just bothered us far too often to allow us enjoy our evening  
Ive been to here before and enjoyed   but will be somewhat less excited at the prospect of a future visit "
R0099,Breakfast took over  30 minutes to come to table  Had to ask the server  Not a great experince
R0099,"Burger just came with chips 
Belly of pork was just on a bed of green leaves  no potatoes or such "
R0099,Decent food  but improvements needed in the operations  Service was generally slow  Ordered a drink  whiskey  neat  but was brought a cocktail  After the server corrected the order  it took another 20 min to get the drink  Server told us the bar service was slow that night because other tables were just drinking      As for the food  had the fillet beef tacos  which were very good  and a mushroom artichoke pizza  Wanted to try the tuna ceviche  but the kitchen was out of tuna  I was expecting more out of the ambiance  It was nice  but nothing special 
R0099,Dinner offering really needs attention  Some of the male waiters looked really scruffy and unkempt
R0099, Prawn tacos were awful  zero flavor with canned salsa and half cooked shrimp  Service was non existent  AVOID
R0099,Excellent meal on Saturday last   Group of four who all had different choices and every one loved it 
R0099,Food doesnt meet the standards for the price 
R0099,Food mediocre  service very friendly but chaotic  management need to employ a few more staff   atmosphere pretentious  went to out as soon as we could for a proper bit of craic
R0099,Food very disappointing  we waited far too long from the time ordered to be served  I had to approach the waitress asking had she she forgotten us  her response was �absolutely not�  However our food arrived immediately afterwards  luke warm  and  dried out  I suspect she had forgotten   We subsequently ordered cappuccinos  one request was for extra hot  they were both almost cold  we asked for replacements which were served promptly  The setting is lovely  however none of us would return   In fact I have a booking this weekend which I am going to cancel 
R0099,"food was very disappointing and it wasnt clear from the web site that brunch menu was only available as we waanted lunch 
food needed something more"
R0099,Sorry guys but a huge disappointment to my Saturday night  Avoid 
R0099,Had dinner on a saturday night with a group of four people  Service and ambiance was good  What let this place down was the dessert  One group member ordered the Creme Brulee which came out cold including the carmalised top which was burnt in parts and had lumps of uncarmelaised brown sugar  When we queried this with the matradee  he said it was meant to be like that and rushed off  His lack of concern and empathy was disappointing 
R0099,Had Eggs Benedict   didnt think it was possible not to like Eggs Bene but this was not nice with not much flavour  very bland 
R0099,Had two different bottles of wine  both disappointing 
R0099,I am really disappointed  The toast was not toasted  The pudding are oversized and poorly cooked and soggy  I felt the menu was limited  On the plus  the coffee was great and the service prompt
R0099,"I have been here for dinner had a complete different experience each time  

Dinner   I got the roast chicken dish for main and the sundae for dessert  I found the food extremely disappointing  However  the setting and ambience in the restaurant was great  I am hoping the issue with the food is down to the fact that it was new at the time  "
R0099,I only had drinks here but must say I was disappointed with the service  We were in the upstairs bar and thought we had to go up each time to order  the bar man wasnt friendly at all  Then a waiter came after we already had drinks and seemed annoyed with us  Felt quite awkward and unwelcome  They have a selection of tapas and maybe the downstairs restaurant is better but dont think Ill return any time soon 
R0099,I tried planning a party here from the U S  I emailed them and their facebook  I did not receive any emails after emailing multiple times  I also got left on read in facebook messenger  Its good to know they arent hurting for business  This was totally rude and Im happy to take my business elsewhere  I wouldnt give any stars for bad service 
R0099,I wouldnt recommend this restaurant to anyone  For a few simple reasons  I asked for mayonnaise  they said they �had none� I was cool about it but reminded them there was a Tesco downstairs  next door  initiative anyone  How can a restaurant expect to be taken seriously when they dont have mayo  The dish I ordered was functional  chicken on a waffle with hot sauce  you get exactly whats on the tin there was literally nothing else on the plate a hunk of chicken a waffle and sauce it was remarkably naked of any garnish and of anything of interest  Never thought Id encounter a dull plate featuring seasoned chicken   Hence the request for the elusive mayonnaise 
R0099,Indifferent service  Poorly trained staff 
R0099,"Is not going to happen again  The meat is good as in any other burger bar in town  But they are cheaper 
"
R0099,"It is kinda sad that people in Dublin might think this is what Lebanese food is like and ""the best in town"" as everyone here has described  As a daughter of a Lebanese father I am used to the real flavours and spices but this place didnt even have the right dressing for the fattoush salad  what a shame    We ordered the vegetarian mezze and let me tell you that everything was absolutely bland  Food looks to be pre made and normally you always get a tea as part of a real Lebanese service  which was not the case  "
R0099,Korean food  Im sure there are better options in Dublin 
R0099,Lovely venue  The food was tasty but mains portions were far too small for the price  Starters and desserts were just as large  Service was okay
R0099,Noisy Portions very small Sides extra and expensive Bad value We didnt feel welcome 
R0099,Not good value for money
R0099,Not good value for money  I felt as if I had paid  Euro 72 for a pizza  two scoops of vanilla ice cream and a couple of glasses of wine  Atmosphere was good and decor was lovely  Service was not very good   waiter had absolutely no idea about wine  he even told us so    then had to come back to check our order even though my friend had already gone to confirm it with him as we were not confident he had got it right  It then took at least 15 minutes for our bottle of white wine to arrive  Overall  it was disappointing  For such a fabulous location and venue  the restaurant needs serious looking at by management 
R0099,Our first time here  was very disappointing   We were seated close to the door and every time the door opened there was a freezing draught blowing in   The only other seats available were in the centre aisle which we did not want  so considering we had booked well in advance we felt like we were seated in the booth that no one else wanted   We were seated for a good 15 20 minutes before a waiter came to ask if we wanted a drink and at least two of the dishes we wanted from the menu were not available   My soup was cold and the rest of the food  bar my daughters pizza was very mediocre   Overall  I think it is over priced and over rated 
R0099,"Our group of four ate here last month and were impressed with the cute space and cozy atmosphere  We ordered a bottle of Italian red and flipped through the menu while we waited  

We each ordered starters and by the time they arrived our wine had not yet been brought out  20 minutes without wine is a bit much  especially with only 4 tables full in the restaurant  but after we reminded the waiter he sorted us out 

I had the bruschetta  fettuccini bolognese and the tiramisu  Each dish looked lovely but if it werent for the photos I would have forgotten each of them by the following morning  I wanted to love this place but the food was average and the service was somewhat poor  Pass "
R0099,Over priced  did not have all drinks advertised  pizza undercooked  Overall  unimpressed 
R0099,Overall average  wont be rushing back anytime soon 
R0099,Overall the restaurant has a fab view but is over priced for the quality and selection of food  The wine list is extremely expensive
R0099,"Overpriced  over salted  under seasoned  The interior is casual with a subtle hippy vibe  ""No WiFi  talk to your neighbor "" Erm  Im just trying to map the way back to my hotel  but I guess I can figure it out by following the direction of the sun or whatever  I liked their vintage church furniture  but the self service cafeteria style setup did not feel cohesive  "
R0099,Really disappointed  staff were uninterested teenagers and food was tasteless  bland and uninteresting  Due to over cooked  unseasoned fatty steak  they gave us 20 percent off bill      a table of 6 people  no one enjoyed their meal and we paid 75e each 
R0099,Reminded numerous times throughout the meal that table was required back at 8 30pm  booking was 6 30pm  which did not make for a relaxing meal 
R0099,"Rip off in every way
They think the Celtic tiger is still alive how on earth can they charge so much for ingredients that cost so little never again "
R0099,Service was terrible  50 minute wait for our food  no apologies or explanation  Food passable  overpriced  Wont be back
R0099,Service was unbelievably bad  Waitress only came over to our table twice in our 3 hour sitting  Every time we wanted to order food  drink   get the bill and pay the bill we had to call someone  Two dishes were sent back due to being burnt/ cold  Food was average at best 
R0099,Service was very poor and the food only average  The atmosphere was good with a buzz about the place  Have eaten there 3 times and wont be going back for food
R0099,Service was very poor for what I paid never go back
R0099,"Shockingly bad experience  
Slowest service on the planet  they forgot to put my dinner order in  5 of us dining  and  at945pm I was told Id no dinner   Our reservation was  at8pm on a Wednesday night 

We were supposed to receive a follow up phone call from restaurant manager but I never got one 

This is yet another bad review for press up group restaurants  Someone needs to hire experienced staff and management with haste  Completely overpriced for the bad experience 

Poor poor service and I will not return nor will anyone at the table "
R0099,So bad  The staff is rude and not helpful  and the food gave me food poisoning  
R0099,"So noisy we couldnt hear one another talking 
Mediocre food which was not cheap "
R0099,"Sorry  I had great expectations about this place  maybe I visited the place during a busy time  it was new years eve  the service was terrible  we were waiting for a table but some people came after us and was seated and served first   
Food was delicious  well presented  so tasty  I loved my pasta with prawns  however  after we finished our meal the waiter took so long to come back that we just ended up paying the bill  which was a shame because I wanted to try their dessert  I might come back one day    Or maybe not "
R0099,Steak over cooked  Service was very bad  Previous visit was very good so extremely let down this time  Will try here again and hopefully service  and  steak is better
R0099,"The delicious Indian restaurant  There is a lot of indian foods menu  and reasonable price 
However I was disappointed about one thing  We ordered drinks grass of wine and beer  and 2 types curry  and then we was waiting these    15mins later  these didnt come to my table even drinks  And finally we got the curry after 35mins or 40mins  And also we asked check  but they didnt come quickly  Everything moving so slow   
Foods was good  but I got tired of waiting "
R0099,The food was delicious  The service was awful  Only for the manager who did notice what was going on and helped a bit we would have walked out  I have never seen staff to be so uninterested in helping  It was embarrassing as I had picked the restaurant for some friends  Such a shame cause the food was amazing 
R0099,The food was lovely  We were celebrating a friends engagement and I had rang ahead to ask if balloons and confetti on the table was ok  I was told it was definitely ok  During the meal two different staff members made a big deal about how the confetti was not allowed and when I explained I had asked ahead of time they were not apologetic and made us feel very uncomfortable  The whole atmosphere changed and ruined the dinner  We proceeded to clean up the confetti ourselves and even apologised to the general manager who was also rude to us  I could not fault the food but they ruined an occasion that I cannot get back and for that I will not be returning here  Its a huge pity the staff and service ruined something so special 
R0099,The kitchen had issues so we had to wait a long time  I was disappointed with the quality of the food  The French toast was very stale and had very little  egg in it
R0099,"The place is really nice but service is extremely slow and the food is nothing special  Quite pricy and the quality is not that great  
I guess you pay the view but for food not worth it "
R0099,The service here is a complete shambles  The food is very average with small portions and expensive for what you get  We wont be back and we live just down the road
R0099,The staff are not very nice and barely speak english 
R0099,"The staff were lovely but not enough of them we waited each time to get attention of someone for wine etc  
We were close to the door and every time the door opened a blast of cold air came in   we eat our dinner with coats on 
The tables are also extremely long and we were doing the servers work by passing plates/glasses food etc up and down the table not ever nice when trying to have a conversation with friends 
The food was good   however my filet steak came out totally raw in the middle   the cost was also expensive especially when we were cold and had to pass plates up and down the table
Staff were very nice"
R0099,They gave us the wrong order  and  also both of us ordered waffles they gave us pancakes  we told the waitress  and  she said they were the waffles  Asked to see the drinks menu after we ate no one came to take our order so we left  Very disappointed
R0099,This is the third time I have been to here  twice for lunch and once for dinner  over the past few months  The lunch food is appalling  extremely low standard  The standard of food does not go with the lovely design and location of the restaurant  Nothing was cooked properly and it was tasteless and dreadfully prepared  The lady  host  was unprofessional and did not give a damn about service or customer satisfaction  she was disinterested  The restaurant will close down if this continues  The dinner menu and food was prepared and cooked better  ie  probably a different chef  This is very unfortunate as it could be a very popular business as the location in Ranelagh is superb and there is a very high footfall in this neighbourhood which has a huge range of good quality restaurants  I have spoken to many other people who have also given a chance and the feedback is the same from everyone   very disappointing  dreadful food  uncaring indifferent staff  great cocktails 
R0099,"This place is overrate and the food on the menu isnt that amazing on top of that the staff is a bit all over the place  You literally have to chase them to order food or drinks  for the price of the place this is bad   

Disappointed about this place  �Wanna be fancy place� but fail "
R0099,This was my first breakfast in Ireland and Im not sure what I was expecting but the food here was average  There were limited items on the menu and nothing stood out except the scone and the fluffy eggs 
R0099,Had passed this Diner numerous times before I eventually went in  The reason I did was because it was more quiet than Ive ever seen it  Maybe the post pub grubbers have had the same bad experience that I did  I asked for my burger well done but was served a rare piece of meat that still managed to be dry  Didnt even know that was possible  And the bun was far from fresh  Even though their customers are mostly intoxicated party people  they still have to have some standards  Want a burger  No thanks 
R0099,Very poor slow service   disappointing overall  The staff didnt know the menu  and  we waited ages for coffee/desserts 
R0099,Very unhappy with the service  Servers seemed to concentrate almost exclusively on a large group which were very load   maybe hoping for a big tip  Food very average   too much salt on chips let customers add salt if they wish do not cover chips with it in advance  Waited over 30 minutes with desert menus for someone to come back to take order by then had lost interest
R0099,Wanted a true Irish experience not something found in the tourist area  so we came across this place and tried it for lunch yesterday but it was closed  Tried again the today and it was open  But bad decision to stop by  Not worth the money you spend  Inattentive staff and below average food 
R0099,"We booked a table for breakfast on Christmas eve having obtained great reviews etc  about the restaurant however we were disappointed with the service level but the food and ambiance/location was excellent  

The disappointing issues:
1  Loads of staff yet poor service and attention to detail 
2  Wait of 25mins for initial drinks order and then the order was wrong
3  When food came out we requested additional items from the front of house who served us but we never returned nor provided the requested items 

Given that it was Christmas eve we did not comment or highlight to the mgt  team as it was the start of the Christmas and festive celebrations  however it was slightly disappointing "
R0100," Amazing place for brunch  I had the eggs benedict  The hollandaise was the best that Ive had  rich and creamy   A generous helping of salmon was well 
The wife had an open club sandwich  which looked great  I was too full from my meal to sample it though 
Id definitely come back"
R0100,5 of us had lunch and it was absolutely delicious  Will certainly be back 
R0100,"A pretentious restaurant that claims French influence  but there is nothing  French there except the prices  
Amateur service   The waiters do not relate to the diners at all "
R0100,Delicious Irish stew  lamb  potatoes  vegetables  and generous pints of local beer  What more could you ask for  Free WiFi and a place to hang and enjoy a beer and some delicious food 
R0100,Excellent food  service and atmosphere  I went on Christmas Eve and the ambiance was wonderful 
R0100,Excellent menu  Service amiable and efficient  Food delicious and good value 
R0100,Fab Christmas evening out for large group of friends  Fab drinks and food  Lovely atmosphere too 
R0100,"From Luxemburg to Dublin 

Place to be  Very good Food and very good Music  Special points for the waitress an the owner "
R0100,Good service and a nice dinning room   unfortunately the food wasnt great  
R0100,Great early bird menu  Very pleasant staff and tasty food  
R0100,"Had early bird menu prior to a concert 
It was really lovely and excellent value 
Staff are very friendly and professional 
Will be back "
R0100,I have great memories of this place    wobbling home after a night out  stopping in for a quick snack box  Great chips  very good chicken  hard to go wrong  
R0100,In the opinion of the 14 German visitors in booked in this was an excellent choice  Varied menu and good choice of wine  Service very good  Atmosphere cheerful
R0100,"Just had the daily lunch special  which was a very good beef sandwich  nice salad and pickle  warm ciabatta bread 

Nice place for a quick lunch"
R0100,Lovely food  great service  Staff friendly and knowledgeable  Atmosphere great  Will definitely be going back again  
R0100,Music was a bit too loud  apart from this it was lovely
R0100,Not sure where Id be without this place  Its trans support group helped me when I needed it most  Also  nice little cafe 
R0100,"Ordered chicken jalferezi  No no no completely not at all authentic  Everything we ordered ended up tasteless  
We sat so long for someone to serve us water  Once they do serve water they go down n dont bother about customers sitting upstairs  The staff is not at all welcoming 
40 Euro  wasted and none of my friends enjoyed the meal "
R0100,Really enjoyed my visit  food was delicious  service was great  staff very polite and friendly  definitely recommend and will definitely go back again
R0100,Server was extremely rude and unfriendly  We were made to feel like we were bothering her  She did not introduce herself  did not tell us the specials  did not offer drink refills  was visibly aggravated we were splitting credit cards as payment  Worst service we received while traveling through Dublin
R0100,The deli counter is one of the best for value I think in the city considering the quality and quantity of food you are getting for your money  My favourite dishes are the chili con carne or the fish stew which come with two sides for  Euro 8 50 and will see you full for lunch and dinner 
R0100,"This is the only thing you need to know   get the fries with garlic aioli  If youre really hungry then get the chicken sandwich or the burger or whatever with it  but the fries will be the best part 

We also got the falafel plate which I promptly threw up the next morning after waking up at 4am feeling nauseated   Not due to alcohol because I dont drink  I have guts of steel and pretty much never get sick from food vs the boyfriend who has had numerous episodes of food related bathroom episodes  I will probably never get falafels from anywhere for the rest of my existence  

Aside from the food  this place is pretty loud and crowded  You seat yourself and desperately try to flag a waiter to get some menus  Then after youve had some time to peruse said menu  you once again try to put on your ""please help me"" face to get some assistance in ordering said food  STAY AWAY FROM FALAFEL PLATE   However  once you order  the food comes out pretty quickly  Dont wait around for a waiter to ask for the check though  because honestly  3 times of trying to look like a helpless child whos just trying to throw some money at you for a decent meal is just 3 times too many  So just eat your food and walk out  Theyre too busy to notice anyway 

Just kidding  Go to the bar and let them know where you were sitting and they can pull up your check  But seriously if I had known I was just gonna vomit up that food in 10 hours    "
R0100,This was just okay  I got the nachos and the meat �was super greasy  and the chips were super thin 
R0100,This was recommended by the taxi driver  popular with locals  had live music playing  great atmosphere 
R0100,"Three of us went with high expectations for the last night of our vacation 
To be fair  we got a reservation at the last moment  but it was at a table that they must have added  in the middle of the hall beside the bar  and the acoustics were so poor that we spent the next hour yelling at each other and could not hear a thing  �Two hours later  my ears are still ringing  �It would have been better for them to tell us that they did not have a table  and we would have found another restaurant 
That said  the service was quite attentive and the food what you would expect from a high end steak house "
R0100,Was very Meh  Was expecting a nicer experience and food  Service was ok but was in and out very quickly  not the type of place to have a long meal in 
R0100,"We had eaten in here years ago and when we were going to a play in the Abbey thought it would be ideal for pre theatre dinner  How wrong we were  
The menu itself was uninspiring  bland and it was difficult for both of us to pick from  We decided to both go for fish and chips in the end  
It arrived less than 5 mins after ordering  How can you do that  It was obviously completely preprepared  the chips very firm and the mushy peas while tasting fine were freezing 
We asked for dessert menu and again it was hard to choose from  we had a chocolate tart and kiwi cheesecake  Chocolate tart was ok but kiwi cheesecake must have been last weeks  hard base that you had to pick up to get through and a tasteless green goo on top 
No excuses for this type of food anymore  Our waiter didnt ask once how was the food  he stated Im glad you enjoyed that and collected the plates 
While we could eat most of the meal it isnt priced appropriate to its quality and wasnt the enjoyable treat we had expected  We will NOT be back 
Noticeable that the majority of customers were on tour or visitors with very few locals "
R0100,We shouldnt have worried about a reservation  They approached our taxi as soon as it pulled up to the curb  They were trying to get customers in by speaking to anyone passing by  There was one other occupied table at the time  The food was really bad  We usually wont say much if one plate is off  but both were  We told our server who sent the manager over  After paying for drinks we left without eating  Maybe just an off night  but they should have been on top of their game with so few customers  Poor food might be the reason why 
R0100,We visited the pub side of this establishment with 11 people  Service was good and the beer was cold  The food was really good 
R0100,Wed been eyeing this place as we planned our recent trip to Dublin  We ended up making reservations for a Friday evening pre theater dinner  and the dinner didnt disappoint  The food was phenomenal and the service was exactly what you would expect and/or hope for 
R0100,Well worth putting this place on your bucket list you will not be disapointed
R0101,We enjoyed our breakfasr  Food was very good  The one fault we had was we were cold  Need more heating on a winter morning
R0102,Food was delicious  Lovely atmosphere and excellent friendly service 
R0102,I have eaten and few times now and everytime everything always perfect  No complaints 
R0102,Loved this restaurant   Ambiance good food and service   A little gem in Crumlin village 
R0103,A great restaurant with superb food and excellent crew  I recommend highly   Of particular note  I should add  is Keshks bring your own wines policy 
R0103,A must in south Dublin  excellent food  extraordinary espresso and the most lovely staff   thank you  
R0103,Absolutely delicious food  so close to the airport  Extremely good value for the quality and great service  Will definitely dine again and have recommended to friends
R0103,Always love going to this restaurant the staff are amazing and so is the food  reasonably priced for the food and service provide
R0103,"Amazing food  staff and the prices 

I was shocked by the fact it was so cosy"
R0103,Beautiful food and always such great service  Fantastic value for money 
R0103,Bland basic food  certainly not authentic Italian  poor decor  basic table   Pretty much nothing else I can say   First and last visit 
R0103,Excellent Service  Excellent Staff  We have gone here a few times   never had an issue with parking and always looked after  Very reasonably priced also 
R0103,Favourite restaurant in Dublin  great service  nice drinks selection  nice location  friendly and welcoming
R0103,Food fab  service quick  lovely staff and not too pricey
R0103,Found the service very slow  the starters were luke warm but didnt send back as we were starving   Mains was delish 
R0103,"Great spot for brunch  food was good and the place is really nice and has a great view of the city 
The menu has something for everyone and the service was friendly but a bit slow "
R0103,Had a great meal here when in Dublin for single night  Great pizza and very friendly staff  Will head back when in town again for sure 
R0103,"Love this restaurant 
Pizza are smashing 
Only because I love cheesecake its not on the menu maybe you could add "
R0103,Lovely place to eat in the heart of Dublin  Spotless great menu for those in a hurry  Home cooked to the highest standards  Skip the fast food and give the soup dragon a try  Youll be back for more
R0103,Made a reservation but when we arrived they were closed    They need to update their online app profile 
R0103,My date used me for a chocolate brownie
R0103,Not happy at all with your service  
R0103,"Oh this place is one of my favourites in Dublin  Simply perfect for catch up conversations along with amazing drinks  

Th ""outside"" is marvelous  the light and the plants definitely give it a magical touch "
R0103,One of the beet nights out you can have is here  Groups of 2 plus  Always great banter from a great crowd  Always busy and the your never waiting to long at the bar for a pint �or shot
R0103,"Points noted 

Brilliant value for money excellent food and the service was impeccable to the point we returned a second time during our weekend break  Book to avoid disappointment"
R0103,Really enjoyed our lunch here  Food was excellent and service was efficient and friendly  Strongly recommend Little Venice 
R0103,"Really great place to eat 
Fast service everytime 
Desserts menu needs a cheesecake option imho"
R0103,Very disappointed to be served reheated food  it was rock hard  
R0103,"Staff didnt seem to know about our booking when we arrived and left us waiting for about 5 10 minutes while they found a table for us  The waitress was quite nice and helpful  The others in my group enjoyed their food and drinks  My burger was brought out but it was not what I ordered  I mentioned this to the waitress who said she would check with the kitchen  She came back a few minutes later with the correct burger and was very apologetic   in reality  the chef had taken off the onion ring and replaced it with jalape�os to make it right  this meant the burger was freezing cold by the time I got it 

The restaurant itself had a nice  cosy atmosphere but had a very damp smell which took away from the vibe  I wouldnt return or recommend it to others "
R0103,Staff are very friendly and give a lovely warm welcome  food is always amazing i highly recommend
R0103,Table service isnt great most of the time  but best take away coffee in Dublin in my opinion  Food isnt too shabby either
R0103,"Very good as always   

Excellent service and staff   "
R0103,Was there there for hubbys b day with my 2 children  Lovely food  great atmosphere  cosy and family friendly 
R0104,A taste experience  Fantastic  And really friendly staff too  Really enjoyed the atmosphere and easily accessible 
R0104,Beautiful restaurant  fantastic service  great food  A welcome addition to Phibsboro 
R0104,Beautifully decorated local restaurant with great food and ambience   Very nice addition to the neighbourhood 
R0104,Brilliant food and great atmosphere  Lucky to have a place like this in the neighbourhood 
R0104,Excellent brunch in one of the best restaurants in the city  Absolutely will go back  Nice staff too 
R0104,Excellent food and service every time  Great addition to D 7
R0104,Food was good but overpriced for what it is  Small menu and not all were available at a very early part of the evening  Service however was excellent
R0104,Food was great  Decor was lovely  Service was amazing  Really loved it 
R0104,Food was pretty terrible  I got the full Irish and I could tell half of the food was frozen/canned  
R0104,Food wasnt great 80 euro for chicken dish and a bottle of wine  Liked decor and could be good
R0104,Full marks for trying though  No less than two members of staff talked us through things  and they really did their best   did I sense concern that people are having difficulty getting it  Whichever   in the end  it was all too much for me   cue set menu  
R0104,Good pizza and quite cheap compared to other places  If you order online the ways to customize your pizza are very good 
R0104,Had a team lunch here a few weeks ago and really enjoyed the food and service   Looking forward to my next visit  Highly recommended
R0104,I came in one day for lunch and they had a coffee and sandwich deal  I asked if I could get tea instead with the deal and was told no so I went with the coffee and sandwich  I know they try to say they are great a brewed coffee but I thought it was just okay  The bread on the sandwich was dry and overall I was very unimpressed  I tried a latte on a different day and it was terrible  On the plus side they have seating space downstairs and upstairs 
R0104,"Ive never been very feminine when it comes to food  and I dont mind getting sauce all over my hands  Sound familiar  Then 100 percent get down to try wings here  Honestly one of the best places of if you have ever been a lovely of buffalo wings  There are a very limited amount of places where they get everything right: portion size  sauce  dips etc  You certainly wont be hungry after this feed and the sauce is 100 percent just right  not too mild/spicy  Brought my American cousin here and he couldnt fault it  Always great to see a place so busy too 

Would recommend to a friend"
R0104,Overpriced for food  My starter was very small  Chicken came in batter and with scones soaked in butter which made them very soggy and unappealing  Was very disappointed considering the price of the meal which didnt include desert or coffee 
R0104,Slight delay getting our table but a complimentary cocktail eased the pain  Food was fabulous and atmosphere was great  very enjoyable Friday evening locally 
R0104,The atmosphere was nice  cozy and relaxed  The food was  great I especially enjoyed the ribs  Overall I enjoyed the dinning experince  Would definately recommend it 
R0104,The meal and service was fabulous  Have never enjoyed a steak so much  worth every penny and would love to return
R0104,This is a great spot for a mid week bite  early dinner or girly get together  The food is really tasty  the service good and its BYOB 
R0104,Unfortunately we waited over an hour for food that was 10 20 pm approximately
R0104,Very good service and food  Slightly overpriced though  although I would imagine overheads in the Phibsboro area are high 
R0104,Very nice burgers and excellent milkshakes  The hot dogs are perfect and they have a big selection of drinks 
R0104,We were disappointed overall  The food was only mediocre  The restaurant was very empty when we were there  however another couple were seated right beside us  the tables are too close together  we were more like a party of 4 rather than 2  We were overcharged for our meal and had to bring it to our servers attention  a difference of  Euro 11  A disappointing meal   Unfortunately we wont be back
R0104,"Went here for breakfast  and had the ""big "" Boy  was it big  It sustained me through the day  such that I could skip lunch  The ambiance is funky  and the staff very friendly and charming "
R0105,I dont think Ill be back  it was busy for that time of day and looked like it was fully booked for later  Seems lile they are just taking advantage of the location and Im sure prey mostly on unsuspecting tourists who will never give repeat business 
R0105,I love the personnel  in particular concierge  and  pianist 
R0105,"Ive said time and time again that the best places to get fish and chips are not these chiperies  but rather  traditional Irish pubs  Do yourself a favor and find a highly rated pub with fish and chips on the menu  We only came here because my friend has Celiac Disease  and this place is able to make gluten free fish and chips  

Service was unbelievably terrible  A girl took our order  �It took a while for our food to come out  and when it did  it was a giant mess  Food was brought out by another employee  a male  My friend was served regular  not gf  fish and chips  Luckily she noticed that it looked exactly like my husbands and inquired  The man apologized and told her that the girl who took our order was new and the gf order was never entered  As they were taking her food away  I mentioned that I had ordered regular fish and chips   that it was mine  The man told me that he had to bring it to another table that had ordered it  I dont understand the logic of it originally being my friends dish but it now being for another table  �I think maybe my meal was never put in and hers was put in incorrectly  but I still dont understand why they couldnt give it to me  as it was my order  

"
R0105,Loved the food and the staff where friendly but did not like the place in which we were seated to near the fire and the smoke from it sort of ruined my first experience of the place
R0105,My mother and sisters had a lovely time  The surroundings service and food were excellent  I would highly recommend it 
R0105,The ambiance was lovely Staff and service good Food was disappointing   Sandwiches and scones were poor 
R0105,The place is beautiful  I couldnt fault it we were made feel very special the whole experience was exceptional   We will be back
R0105,The staff had a great deal of knowledge and very friendly  Thank you very much 
R0105,"There was a Pianist playing which was lovely however due to the existing noise in the room   there was a vey large group situated at the top centre of the room  the pianist played quite loud  This resulted in an atmosphere  which wasnt that relaxing   We mentioned it to the staff who attentively said this to the pianist  The pianist came over to us three times and mentioned about how she had to play loud as a result of the large group  Im not sure why the staff told her it was us who complained as having her come over multiple times didnt make us feel great  Service was good standard  Food ok  Disappointing that one the desserts came in a plastic container rather than a nice glass  
I wont be going back unfortunately which is a shame as the setting is beautiful "
R0105,Very disappointed in the  unfestive atmosphere of our trip which we had very much been looking forward to   Overpriced and over rated   Difficulty in gaining  access   Waited 45 minutes for our table   No festive spirit at all   Staff were young but friendly but place seemed to lack management   Piano player was a welcomed addition to the dining room  
R0105,Very disappointing experience there was no variation on the sandwiches so we were limited to two types  We asked for no cheese so Im assuming they werent making the sandwiches up fresh since they didnt accommodate  The desserts were terrible even the scones tasted like baking powder  Very over priced we wont be returning  Table was very low and uncomfortable
R0105,We really enjoyed our Afternoon tea  Castle is amazing 
R0105,We totally enjoyed the afternoon tea last Sunday   would highly recommend it  will definitely return again 
R0105,Went back here for an anniversary lunch as we got married here 5 years ago and loved returning with our kids  Service was exceptional and the staff could not do enough to look after us all  Highly recommended
R0106,Cozy spot for a fantastic Irish breakfast  Breakfast served all day  Friendly staff and great service 
R0106,Excellent food and service  Will definitely be back soon  
R0106,"One of my fav spots in Dublin  I have eaten here many many times a a have never been let down 

Staff are excellent"
R0106,This is a must visit spot  I cant wait to go back 
R0106,We ate in Mams on a Thursday evening  Parked in The Square  Very accessible  Lovely food
R0107,Stay away from this restaurant  It wouldnt meet any health code requirements  The service is horrible  and the chicken in my dish was something unknown to me  In other words  it wasnt chicken  The carpets are dirty as are the waiters 
R0108,Impeccable and friendly service  and good value yummy Thai food  Our favorite Thai in Dublin 
R0109,Excellent food and good service
R0109,Our first stop after an overnight flight  Was cozy and cute and a great introduction to breakfast in Dublin  Service was kind and food was delicious 
R0109,Absolutely lovely restaurant with great food and staff  My wife has several food allergies  and they were more than accommodating to her needs  Two things firmly up 
R0109,Always have a great time  cant rate it highly enough
R0109,Awesome breakfast  really good food and a fast waitor  
R0109,"Came here on the off chance on a Saturday afternoon  
Took a look at the menu and it took me quite a bit of time to choose my sweet treat  Everything sounded so good   and looked it too  You can drool over the cakes on display while you queue  

I ordered a chocolate cannolo  not cannoli as this is the singular    an Americano and a San Pellegrino limonata  The three items came to  Euro 8 20  






Its got to be a good sign when you can hear a lot of Italian being spoken around you  right  





I really wanted to get a tiramisu to take away but decided I probably shouldnt be so greedy  So I have an excuse to go back and thats definitely for next time

R0109,Everything Ive tried here has been so nice  The fish chowder with mash and the mushroom salad are two of my favorites  Didnt care too much for the focaccia  The pastries also look delicious and are so tempting 
R0109,Everything was fantastic  many thanks for the beautiful food  Looking forward to our next visit 
R0109,Excellent restaurant  beautiful food and service and an overall 5 star dining experience  Will return
R0109,Fantastic as always  food fabulous and staff always superb
R0109,Fantastic food and service as usual  Highly recommend  Thanks guys and see you soon 
R0109,Great food and fantastic customer service   really makes the difference in my opinion 
R0109,Great friendly service and delicious food as always 
R0109,Great restaurant with great food and staff thanks
R0109,Great staff  super friendly  Food was really tasty and there was no rush/urgency during the service  Would go back again with pleasure 
R0109,Guinness was flat  food nothing to brag about and the service is terrible  Loud and trendy 
R0109,Had a wonderful afternoon and evening there  Food was excellent and staff were so nice and friendly  We will be back
R0109,"I dont know what the fuss is about this place  It was very busy on a Saturday morning and we were happy to get a table  
I ordered a latte and a salmon  cream cheese bagel and it came with a small side salad  To be honest  there was nothing special and I was a bit disappointed as my friend had raved about it "
R0109,I had been meaning to try here for so long and finally got the chance as an end of exams treat  I obviously had to try the wings so myself and Laura Fay went for one portion between us with a side of fries and onion rings  Wings were amazing and I have to say come in close second to my all time fave in Dublin   Blue Bar of course   Reasonably priced  good sized portions  friendly staff and quick service  Ill definitely be back 
R0109,"I have never got dissapointed  at this place
The food is tasty and there is a large selection of burgers and dishes 
They also refill the drinks and they even gave us free French fries 
The price Is a bit expensive but worth it "
R0109,I ordered a well done steak to be left eating black bits of my steak  chips were eatable not enough sauce and really just ok   Waiters were brilliant food not so great for the price
R0109,"I struggled with the downgrade to a 3 but let me at least justify  

1  Squeezed in beside another 2 seater  So close we could have been family 
2  Banged against and coat walked on  Both by the waiters and customers  
3  Coffee served now in tiny cups  If you want to serve and Americano in expresso style cups then offer reduced price refills 

The staff are still great  I like this place but they are not doing themselves any favours 

Yes I know its busy but unless these are addressed I wont be back "
R0109,I wouldnt recommend it
R0109,Loud  but pretty good food 
R0109,Lovely evening lovely food lovely staff  BYOB no charge  Great value
R0109,"Lovely spot   nice �staff  nice food  nice decor easy to park 
Cant find anything negative about the �place"
R0109,Menu reads well but the food isnt that good  Presentation and quality  Over priced for what you get
R0109,Nice pizza and great selection of craft beers  Friendly staff and reasonable prices  Pizzas are around 10 15 euros and beers are around 5 6 Euro 
R0109,"No license so had to go to the local corner shop for a bottle of wine 
Overall ok  but nothing special 
Friendly enough "
R0109,"Not impressed at all 
After seeing so many recommendations I thought I should give this place a try and regret it over and over 

Firstly the staff were some of the rudest Ive ever experienced  Im not asking for everyone to be overly smiley and happy but even a hi would be nice  Show some appreciation that we are choosing to come to your restaurant for example     Dont bang glasses down on the table in front of me  dont not look at me when ordering food  maybe even say how was your meal or have a nice day when we finally come to pay  Not silence and what at times felt like contempt 

Secondly the food was pretty bad  I had the huevos rancheros which comes with home fries whilst my partner had the homemade beans and toast option  If youre going to play with beans please make sure they are a  cooked and not hard and b  actually hot  And also little crackers of bread does not make toast    
As for the huevos rancheros   I think you need to look at other restaurants to see how this should be done The overwhelming flavour and presence on the plate was egg  There seemed to be a million of them on my one limp tortilla smothered in cheese which you couldnt determine what it was by the flavour  All of this alongside the undercooked ""home fries""  Truly awful  Should I have said something  Absolutely  But combined with the apparent lack of interest or care by our waitress Im sure it would have made no difference 

I wouldnt recommend it and I certainly wont be trying it again"
R0109,Nothing but great things to say about this place  Its bigger than it looks so dont be intimidated if theres a line of people outside  theyre probably just making their way up the stairs  We were seated quickly and received our food shortly after ordering  My fiance and I both got the Irish Beef Stew and were not disappointed  The beef practically melts in your mouth and the flavors complemented it perfectly  Wed had Irish stew at another pub on our travels but it didnt even come close to this one  The stew was a little spendy but well worth it with the side of the brown bread  DELISH 
R0109,Nowhere else compares for a really good Thai take out  Loving their new paleo menu  take out without the guilt 
R0109,Rude staff and double charged a group of us for drinks   refused to give us our money back when confronted  effectively stealing from us   Disgraceful business 
R0109,Service and Food are fantastic  You have to know that you need to bring your own wine 
R0109,"The restaurant is situated on top of this place and also by the same chef  The place itself was pretty nice however I felt it was a little too rowdy and noisy to have a nice dinner  I also felt they kind of lack staffs and took them pretty long to get to us 

I had their omakase meal  both the  Euro 55 and  Euro 70 ones   They dont serve the omakase meals by the menu  whereby they served us the nigiri first before the temaki and miso soup  But small details anyway 

The nigiri was pretty good  I felt the lobster and the sea bream nigiri was the best out of the 6  The rice was beautifully seasoned and pressed  Very impressed by the standards  

The miso soup was really authentic with a heavy seafood taste to it  Inside had some clams and mushrooms  enoki  which I was pretty impressed by the enoki  The enoki had this sour taste to it that made the whole soup really appetising  

The temaki was an avocado and a piece of tuna wrapped a wanton like fried skin  It wasnt too bad as a palate cleanser  

There was another course we had that I cant quite remember what they called it  But it was sea bream in a mushroom broth  for the  Euro 55  and a lobster sashimi  for the  Euro 70   The sea breams were perfect with the mushroom broth  Sweet fish with a tinge of sourness from the mushrooms  Absolutely beautiful  The lobster itself had a good and nice texture to it however whatever garnish they had on top was way too sweet  I basically had to scrap it off to finish it  

We had the duck and lobster nabe  The broth for the duck nabe was really sweet with complemented really well with the duck  The duck was really good too  The lobster was really fresh and sweet  but the broth was sub standard  

What I absolutely loved was the desserts  A very interesting innovative dessert   matcha creme brulee with pistachio  white chocolate and yuzu ice cream  Its probably the best dessert Ive ever had  The other option was a chocolate mousse with chocolate cookie  And chocolate can never go wrong  But I highly recommend the match creme brulee  It was simply a delight 

All in all  the meal was pretty good  I just felt the portions were pretty small  But the ingredients were definitely fresh and cooked pretty well "
R0109,"Was tasty   but definitely not worth 10 Euro   Small portion and not that great 
Its cool that you can create your own and they were fast delivering "
R0110,Great experience
R0110,As always superb food and outstanding service and welcome from Bernie
R0110,Brunch   following a recommendation I went back for brunch the following month  What a contrast  I got the eggs florentine  a side of sausages and an OJ and found this to be the nicest brunch I have ever had on Dublin    I would give the brunch 5/5 
R0110,Everything about them were fantastic  Super service and super food fantastic local produce cooked to perfection 
R0110,First visit on a colleagues recommendation  First class food great seafood and steak and excellent service  Well worth a visit
R0110,Food was amazing and service matching it  Would be back again
R0110,Great burritos and a nice place to sit in  the decor is simple but tasteful  The mango salsa is delicious  Value for money  One suggestion is perhaps to set up a loyalty card system
R0110,Great food   good ambience and excellent service   Its not cheap but then again if it was the food would not be as good   you get what you pay for   
R0110,Great food as always
R0110,Great food  good service  only downfall is that its a little expensive  Euro 2 70 for one chips is a bit too much  Very good place all the same  I ALWAYS leave satisfied 
R0110,Greattttt for happy hour with large groups of friends  Get the meatballs   Drooling over here 
R0110,If you wish to have a whiff of the Mediterranean while in Ireland  this is the place to be  Excellent food 
R0110,Lovely staff  went for lunch during a match day and the food was great  as was the atmosphere 
R0110,"Lovely venue with very good and attentive staff
The food was simple but very tasty  just like mother used to make"
R0110,Potentially the best value for lunch on the street;  Euro 3 50 for soup and bread   Euro 4 50 toasties 
R0110,Really great coffee and food  I had the hummus and it was surprisingly delicious and filling  The bread is out of this world 
R0110,Sadly only one vegetarian option on menu which was polenta with a few roast veggies on top and a sprinkling of goats cheese  Very bland and tasteless  Could not eat it 
R0110,Such a fab meal  We both said it was the nicest rack of lamb wed ever eaten 
R0110,Very limited menu with an unaccommodating and unfriendly waitress  Anyone who is trying to reduce red meat consumption should avoid 
R0110,"Very over priced for what it is 
Very small   food was average and very expensive   wouldnt go back"
R0110,We absolutely loved our dinner at   The food was amazing  Staff were very friendly and helpful 
R0110,"We came here for a gin class last night  All 22 of us loved it 

Very entertaining and made us feel special 

Thank you"
R0110,We really enjoyed the evening  The fillet steaks were superb  not to mention the delicious wheaten bread  It was excellent overall and we will definitely be back 
R0110,Will definitely go again as  go to Dublin every new year
R0111,Great food  great location  great service  Lots of parking
R0111,Lovely country style pub hidden Staff always friendly and welcoming   nicest carvery food in my opinion  Id recommend this place without a doubt
R0112,Excellent food  cocktails and great service
R0112,Amazing food as usual  wonderful service and an all round fantastic experience
R0112,Best place for a good and authentic Irish Breakfast  Its a little gem  hidden in Montague street that worth a visit  
R0112,In reverse order  There was really nothing redeeming about the sushi  unfortunately  The rice was excessive in quantity and not very tasty  The ingredients were extremely ordinary quality  especially for the price  We got the pork belly buns  which were the highlight  and the hake + prawn gyoza  which were not bad  but I wouldnt get them again  The cocktails were the highlight  including the epitome of an old fashioned  �according to my dining companion 
R0112,"Delicious Burrito  cheap  and theyve got beer  What more do you want 
Handy spot for a quick feed "
R0112,Everyone I eat here  were happy  I love the place 
R0112,Excellent restaurant  one of my favourites in Dublin
R0112,Favourite place to have sushi in Dublin
R0112,First night in Dublin was super fun  We were told to go here and the place was packed  We got right in and the food was delicious 
R0112,Going for pre theatre dinner at 6 15pm on a Saturday the place wasnt busy  Drinks arrived promptly  food was impossibly slow  We exited at 7 55pm having had to repeatedly ask where our food was  Their reason was the chef was in on his own  Pity  other branches are great usually 
R0112,I adore them  Food is great  service is great and the price is pretty good too  Cant recommend it enough
R0112,I booked a table for 18 30 and received an email confirming the reservation  When I arrived I mentioned to the staff that I had a booking  I was informed that they had not yet opened the email concerning my booking and  in view of the fact that I had only booked recently  45 minutes previous  I would have to wait at least 20 minutes for a table notwithstanding the confirmed booking  We had to go elsewhere  Very unsatisfactory 
R0112,"I booked a table online last Thursday when I went to Dublin for the day from Wexford with my Mother  I walked all over town shopping before going to have dinner knowing I had a table booked only to find that it was closed  I was absolutely disgusted that it was closed after my booking was taken online  I was extremely upset and disappointed      

"
R0112,I felt like We were being looked after by untrained staff on their first night  Ordered a gin and tonic but was told they didnt have any tonic  Anyone with a bit of initiative would have popped across the toad to get some in the near by shop  Not here  Service very hit and miss and over all poor  Food was average 
R0112,Make sure you make reservations  I felt bad for the many people who got turned away from this amazing place  Best steak  best service  best time 
R0112,One word amazing the food is just outstanding and the service
R0112,This is just the best place in Dublin for Japanese food
R0112,"very nice place and food 
my favourite here in Dublin"
R0112,We tried going here for something quick because we stayed at the nearby hotel across the street and it was horrible all around  Dont waste your time  Food is like worse than other places and service is SO slow and terrible 
R0112,When we arrived  the restaurant denied knowledge of our booking and turned us away  Very disappointing as we have enjoyed the restaurant in the past 
R0113,"Lovely restaurant  great service  delicious food  
Great value for money "
R0114,One of the best sandwiches Ive had in a very long time: pear  bacon and cheddar  Wow  On homemade crusty white bread 
R0114,"A lovely treat  

We planned to head here for dinner the night before after a satisfactory dinner out elsewhere  Using the Zomato filters to find the highest rating restaurants around us  this is where I was looking forward to all day  The restaurant is nicely lit  with cute little tealight candles in small recesses in the brick wall  Modern music is a welcome change from the ubiquitous sound of fiddles and acoustic guitars  
A warm welcome from the host  and then the waiting staff made us feel at home and at ease  
We opted for the good value earlybird dinner special  which basically gives you a choice of 2 or 3 courses  with about 5 options from the starters/mains/desserts  
Mrs had the mushroom soup of the day and I had Lamb flatbreads  which had spiced pulled lamb on a hummus topped flatbread  baby rocket  and a yoghurt based topping  Both were delicious  Our mains were Roasted Chicken Breast with a turmeric and tarragon sauce  Lyonnaise potatoes and crispy broccoli  and Confit of Pork Belly  with Squid  on a bed of chickpeas  red peppers and tomato  Again  we were very satisfied with our choices  While my beloved couldnt manage a dessert course  I wasnt going to be deprived and had the Chocolate Brownie  with ice cream  chocolate sauce and whipped cream 

Overall  a most satisfying dinner out  and the food being served around us looked sensational too  Another must visit again restaurant"
R0114,A nice venue for drinks  however the food wasnt what I expected it to be  Must try again with different dishes 
R0114,Another one of my favourite tucked away breakfast/brunch places  Busy for a reason  slim chance youll get in on the weekend  Excellent food  small fresh seasonal menu 
R0114,Cannot recommend this place enough  great food  really good portions and lovely staff
R0114,Didnt think too much of this place  The only thing it has going for it is a cool interior but the food is overpriced and basic  The staff were appalling and the waitress was disgraceful  Pretty much snapped the bill from us despite us leaving a decent tip  Wont be back or recommending 
R0114,"Empty restaurant when we arrived  The waiter was super kind shoutout to him but when I orded lasagna I received mircowaved lasagna  We didnt enjoy the food that much and we ordered drinks and they were fine  
Wouldnt go there again to be honest "
R0114,Even though I explained I had a tomato allergy  my main course arrived covered in tomatoes  I had to order a new dish  which arrived as my friend was finishing hers   It was cold and I ate very little of it   I will say that we were given our meal and drinks on the house which was something but I would have preferred to pay for food that I enjoyed   Wont be going back 
R0114,Food was excellent and reasonably priced but the service was not very good  It was like we were forgotten about after we finished our main course   
R0114,Gnocchi listed as tomato sauce but came out with meat sauce  Nobody was vegetarian but it wasnt what we had ordered  I wish website had better advertised that the a la carte dinner menu didnt start until after 7pm  we wouldve come later ignored we had known only early bird is available until 7  Service was fine  not very warm 
R0114,Go for drinks  not food  We felt very rushed  It tries to be a restaurant and a pub  Should be just a pub
R0114,"Good for all type of groups on the move through Sneem  
Lots of locally sourced food  fresh fish a must "
R0114,Great service  Amazing food  Beautiful atmosphere 
R0114,The sushi rice was poorly cooked and too mushy for proper sushi  The fish was bland  We also tried the Japanese curry with had a slimy texture and a sweet/spicy flavor that was conflicting rather than complimentary 
R0114,I invited a friend to celebrate a special occasion and I got embarrassed in the end  Service very bad  terrible value for money 
R0114,I would recommend
R0114,Lovely spot on a quiet street  Service was impeccable  Hats off   Baked cheesecake and ice cream served with fresh berries   Well be back 
R0114,Nice restaurant however slow service and mediocre food 
R0114,Pizzas were not nice  thick soggy bases  bland flavours  need to get this basic thing right
R0114,place is fab iv been 3 times so far and ill be back again xxx
R0114,Service was very poor and we were pretty much neglected for the 2 hours spent there  which resulted in the restaurant ultimately missing out as we wished to order a lot more drinks and desserts than we were given the opportunity to do  Anytime we managed to get a waiters attention it seemed we were annoying them  Food and drinks were fine but the service made our experience awkward and not one we will rush to have again  Disappointed 
R0114,Slightly disappointed in our first visit to this place  The service was poor  the food was bland and the drinks were ok   The ambience was welcoming and relaxed   but we wont be returning or recommended to our friends 
R0114,So disappointing  Booked as a treat but failed to impress  Ordered pizzas which  tasted very dry  no sauce on base   Chips came 20 mins after pizzas  Staff didnt seem to care that the chips took so long  We Ordered our favourite cocktail  Pornstar Martini  which should come with a shot of proscecco  Instead the barman put the proscecco in the drinks  The drinks only filled 3/4s of the glass  The place was empty with 3 members of staff  The toilets were horrendous  Terrible smell and toilet paper everywhere  This was at 4 30 pm so completely inexcusable  Sadly  I wont be back  Embarrassed that I took my friends there 
R0114,Staff absolutely fantastic and very helpful   food quality very poor with poor presentation   we got a glass of wine each which was warm and not chilled enough and was like vinegar  
R0114,Table was too small  food was only ok  The staff actually argued with two of the girls when indicated they had gotten the order wrong  Service very poor  could barely catch the attention of a staff member to order a drink  Very disappointed 
R0114,The atmosphere was nice  Very popular for Hen parties  The food is also good  Lovely decor though
R0114,The food was really average  We all had the early bird start and mains with one glass of house white wine  Costing 25 EUR which was decent value  However  the main course   pizzas were so so average  I never think you can really go wrong with a pizza but they were all pretty crap  Lacking in flavour  Strange and flavourless toppings  My start of chicken wings was fine  Pretty big portion  However  the very sub standard pizzas ruined it for us  Wouldnt recommend for food to anyone  However  as a bar it is a nice place  Ive been plenty of times for drinks and nights out and its great for that  But the food isnt anything to shout about 
R0114,"The food/service/standards and everything you are looking for were top notch 
HOWEVER  we went on a Saturday night  Booked in for 8pm  Arrived on time and were seated promptly  We had starters and mains  and then after our main course we were just brought the bill  We did not ask for it and we were told that there was a booking on this table in 15 mins  We were only sitting at the table for 1hr and 15  There was no mention of this at the time of booking and no mention when we got to the restaurant  After we paid we were told that the booking was for now  and not for the extra 10 minutes we were told we had 

This is appalling behaviour for a restaurant  We were effectively kicked off the table and due to that we decided to go to a different pub to drink  they effectively lost  Euro 100 in drink sales for less then adequate communication "
R0114,The Waitresses were not friendly  Kitchen closed very Early at 7:30pm  The food was not nice at all 
R0114,They offer a special every day for 5 euros  which was delicious and hearty and included about 4 slices of fresh  crusty bread  Perfect for winter 
R0114,this is a very beautiful location and food was good too but the service was shocking bad   to start with wed a brand new waitress  well we hope she was   but she was completely lost and struggled with the most basic asks  when the food did come we were asked about 15 times if we were happy with everything by multiple people  no joke   and then our plates almost whipped out from under our noses when the waitress was ready to move us on  all in all the location and venue are fab but the service needs some serious work    
R0114,Very loud  Service ok   but not fantastic  Very small portion of Lasagna  Not a great selection of wines  Selection of Tonics outdated on Menu
R0114,Waited 45 minutes for drinks  poor table staff  chips cam out cold
R0114,Waiting for a table at lunch time is ok  the waiting time was short  The staff is friendly and fast  but if you get wrong food served  it is a sign of bad organisation  My partner asked to modify the food from spicy to mild  it was nevertheless spicy  A double disappointment 
R0114,Was told I had to order from evening menu only  Table  beside me asked for a la cart menu and given more choice when I double checked the server shrugged and walked off  We wont be back
R0114,"We booked in for Brunch on a Saturday afternoon  We were the only customers there at the time 
I ordered the Pancakes   with Chocolate Ice cream  walnuts and maple syrup   What I got was cold pancakes  with chocolate ice cream and a few chocolate chips  Not worth the  Euro 11 50 price tag 
My boyfriend ordered a pizza  which was only luke warm and very doughy  
Overall  the service was good  again  we were the only customer there  but the food left  a lot to be desired "
R0114,"We visited this coffee shop on our visit to Dublin and this place serves the best breakfast 

You wont be leaving hungry thats for sure "
R0114,We were a party of 4  Two ordered fish of the day which came with some chopped lettuce leaves and a few tomatoes no dressing  My husband ordered the vegetarian pizza  He got the fish served first  No apologies  Pizza came eventually  Very bad  hardly any vegetables and undercooked base  Chicken pizza wasnt great either  With a big pizza oven was expecting something much better 
R0114,We were not told that we only have the table a hour or so  we hadnt even finished our dinner and we where asked to leave   I found it very unprofessional
R0114,"Went there to celebrate my friends birthday how came from London for the weekend she loved it so did I 
Good food great atmosphere "
R0114,"Wish Id checked  before popping in here for a fast take away lunch  Theres always a queue so I figured it must be decent  �Nope  

Went for the pad thai  Pretty grim to be honest  Dry and hardly any veg/chicken/nuts  

1 star for taste  �Have given them a 2nd star as theres lots of it and its cheap and thats what matters to some people  Not me  �Wont be back "
R0114,Worst service ever and rude when we corrected them about our food  I have never been so appalled by service at a restaurant 
R0115,Came here for a going away lunch with work colleagues and it was lovely  Food was delicious and excellent customer service from the staff
R0115,"Cant get over all the good reviews  I have been here on multiple occasions and it has disappointed each and every time  My first experience was with my girlfriend where I ordered the steak  Too say it was tough would be an understatement  This was easily one of the freshest steaks I have ever had to endure  To claim a 20+ day dry aged steak on the menu and serve up a steak that could have been no more than 8 days aged is simply rude to the customer  The atmosphere in the place is what you would expect from a venue that is trying to impress its customers but the food needs to live up to decor and service  Would have been a 3 rating after first experience as service was good and decor was excellent 
"
R0115,Disappointed was expecting a better experience as my last 2 visits were great will give it another try sometime because i like to support local
R0115,Excellent neighborhood restaurant with lovely food and superb staff
R0115,Food was excellent   location overlooking the canal  Stephano had a great wine recommendation  Life is good here
R0115,"Food was great apart from only having one portion of prawns at half 8 on a Saturday night we ordered 2 and where told ""we only have 1 portion left"" as for the service it was dismal to say the least "
R0115,For dessert  I went traditional and had a bowl of strawberries  goats milk ice cream  a marshmallowy fondant and oat clusters    Although a bit like  a bold  brekkie in a bowl  it hit the spot and was happily devoured  My colleague opted for the cheesecake which was unusually served in a mason jar tucked away inside a pink and white striped bag  akin to what you would get in a picknmix place  
R0115,"Friendly people  nice beer  excellent finger food and professional staff 
The live music was a plus "
R0115,"Good atmosphere and good pints but food leaves a lot of room for improvement
They may just have had a bad day but fish definitely off"
R0115,Good food  Really nice staff  �Value for money  Highly recommended  Good for alone and eating with family 
R0115,Here for a friends birthday party and could not fault it  Food was delicious and service was great  Already cant wait to come back
R0115,I spotted this place; small but sweet  Good for takeaway  as there are only 3 stools available to sit
R0115,The cheeseburger tasted the same as in the States and before I could even think about finding a garbage container  a worker already had taken my bag and cup  depositing it away before I could say anything 
R0115,Love this place  The mussels starter is to die for   The pizzas and pastas are wonderful too  and the cheesecake is one of the nicest Ive ever tasted
R0115,Lovely evening  Food was delicious and so authentic  Staff so friendly and early bird great value  Will be back and highly recommend to friends and family 
R0115,Lovely food and ambience  Very very nice helpful staff  nothing was too much trouble for them  Will definitely be back 
R0115,Lovely food  superb service and great value  A little gem  would highly recommend 
R0115,Lovely little Italian restaurant with authentic meals and great value 
R0115,Serial return customer  Will continue eating here until I die  Even if i died while Im there Id be happy  Love it 
R0115,Service was poor long wait for service and also charged for drinks when shouldnt have been and waiter wouldnt listen when told them  Usually very good when we go here but very disappointing this time unfortunately 
R0115,Sure I was only MAD for a hang and cheese sandwich  I passed by this place just as the taciturn owner was shutting up shop for the day  and asked for a take away toastie  Five minutes later  I was the proud and salivating owner of a batch bread toasted sandwich  presented in a Brennans bread wrapper to keep it warm and then in a brown paper bag  Now thats taking a toastie seriously  Im going to swing by early some morning to check out the brekkie 
R0115,The next time you are around Id really recommend this restaurant 
R0115,"Very busy cafe near grafton street  They have the most delicious muffins and scones  The scones are HUGE  Nearly everyday they sell out if their raspberry scones thats just how good they are 

They have a great breakfast and lunch menu  Ive only have breakfast here  Its quite small but I believe people must go just to try their muffins   Yum yum yum   

Scrambled eggs here are a safe option and Im sure their full fry is just as nice "
R0115,"Was originally put off while waiting for food by the sleazy staff asking drunk girls to kiss them  and then making comments to my girlfriend when I went to the the bathroom 

The chips tasted like they were old and re cooked  very soggy and like cardboard  I had a Chicken burger also which was extremely blandy and soggy and fell apart in my hands 

"
R0115,"We were seated at the door  A cold breeze would sweep in each time the door opened  Its a shame they dont get a curtain and dolce this issue  

There were six in our group  We all got served our main course at a different time  I had to walk to the waitress to ask where my dinner was and also order wine  I believe they stayed away to avoid the situation  The waitress admitted they had a new pizza chef  So after 90 mins after I arrived  I got the pizza  

The restaurant wasnt that busy  so its hard to understand why it took so long to Correct the situation  Service was charged too   

We enjoyed our food its just a shame we didnt get to eat together  "
R0116, Thought wed go for the healthier option which was to go half nude with our burgers   Super filling in a good way and never leaves us with disappointment 
R0116,Low price but 5*quality 
R0116,Absolutely fab meal  The steak is probably one of the best I have eaten in Ireland  Delish
R0116,Awful quality of food  Steak was inedible  and side was manageable only because I was hungry  Ruined the first evening in Dublin 
R0116,Cold food and found plastic in the stew 
R0116,Cute pub with great food  We had the fish chowder and bangers and mash  Great service  Awesome location 
R0116,"Did not enjoy  food was overcooked and overpriced  even with a groupon 
Of the 5 wines  3 were unavailable  and the wine glass was dirty  The plates and furniture was mismatched 

Very twee  and a tourist trap  everyone around us was from a different country and I felt bad for them  Terrible place  in a fantastic location  it could be amazing if they made a tiny bit of effort"
R0116,Excellent lunch before the game  Great service  food and ambiance  Highly recommend it  Definitely my favourite restaurant in Dublin
R0116,Excellent traditional Irish food     traditional Irish pub     first time in Dublin didnt disappoint  
R0116,Excellent value for money and in a great location  very central  This is a small restaurant so I would say make sure you book ahead 
R0116,Fantastic  Im visiting Dublin and decided to pop in  I had the Chicken Kiev with a baked potato which was all extremely delicious  To wash it down I had yellow beer and still water  Highly recommend this place  
R0116,Food disappointing 
R0116, I got a burrito box  which was ok  there may as well have been no salsa as it was so flavourless but the chicken was nice enough  and that unfortunately is about the best thing I can say for the place 
R0116,Food was overall pretty good  Excellent chicken sandwich for lunch  I did have to rephrase my request and order to the waitress several times because she didnt understand what I was asking   
R0116,"Good food  Decent selection  Could use a gluten free sauce choice or two tho 

But overall pleasant experience "
R0116,great location   wonderful people   superb  flavorful food   
R0116,Great   Best seafood and fish and chips in town 
R0116,Hands down  the worst food Ive ever eaten  Chicken was bland  pita was stale  and it was an absolute mess when I unwrapped it  Never coming to this place again  Horrible experience 
R0116,"I have tried tonkasu ramen in probably more than dozens of Japanese restaurants because it is my favorite and this restaurant for sure offers below average ramens  First off  the broth is not ""creamy"" as it says on the menu; and the noodle is too soft and a bit mushy  The cha shu has no flavor  Broth got some flavor but by no means a slow cooked for long hours tonkasu creamy broth  Two stars for their ramen only  Didnt try other stuff "
R0116,I had the 8oz fillet  It was cooked to perfection  seared on the outside and medium rare inside  It was delicious
R0116,I was there on dinner   I think one of the best kabab shop Dublin; salad are really fresh  and  their own hand made sauce extremely A one 
R0116,Love it well managed  excellent service and consistently good food  Should get more recognition 
R0116,Lovely intimate restaurant  Great food and drink  Staff very amenable and attentive  Superb 
R0116,Made a reservation for 2:30 for st Patricks day bc I knew it would be insane  Made the reservation WEEKS ago  Showed up 15 min before my reservation and was rudely told �were full  Go away  this is st Patricks day  We dont do reservations � I said wait but I made this reservation weeks ago  why didnt you all contact me at all before today to tell me you wouldnt honoring reservations today and he said �were full  we dont do reservations on st Patricks day� and slammed the door in my face  Now we will of course never return  Dont trust you have an online app reservation with this place  bc they pick and choose when to honor 
R0116,"Meh  should have gone for sushi  Was so disappointed with the lunchtime special  Bowl of chicken ramen  only came with two leaves of pak choi and a few mushrooms  Nothing else  Not even a soft boiled egg  The noodles were thin and tasted plus looked like they came out of one of those packets you just add water too  The chicken was a bit dry 
Okay  it only cost 8 50  but I know some amazing ramens in town that only cost a tenner 
I had total food envy of the tables beside us enjoying some lovely looking maki rolls  
On a positive note: the edamame beans we shared were yummie  but its hard to get that wrong "
R0116,"My first Mothers Day lunch was here having a feast of seafood with my husband and baby girl  The staff couldnt have been nicer   attentive without being overbearing  and very accommodating  We shared the razor clams to start   they were a little gritty  and although the sauce was delicious it wasnt the best start  

For main  we shared the hot seafood platter: mussels in a cream sauce  Tiger prawns  four generous battered fish fillets  they were so huge you couldnt really call them goujons as the menu did   and calamari with garlic mayo and tartar sauce  Everything was delicious  but by the end of the meal we were feeling stuffed and wishing there had been a mixed hot and cold platter   some fresh crab or steamed prawns would have been a lovely contrast to the mountain of battered and fried fish we ate  lovely though it was  
Craft beer for my husband and a prosecco for me were lovely accompaniments  and a full box of butlers chocolates as a Mothers Day gift was a perfect ending  Well definitely go back "
R0116,Nice food with very friendly staff   only downfall was the price of drinks    Euro 5 50 for a SMALL glass of Heineken WTF   
R0116,Nice selection of salads and flatbread wraps  Moroccan flavours which always appeals  Good Value and healthy options 
R0116,Reservation made was not honored  We never ate there as they sat a walk in before us; even though we had a confirmed reservation  Would not advise using the app to book and to call restaurant directly 
R0116,The atmosphere is exciting and decor nice  I got the fish and chips  my friend got the beef stew and neither was impressive  She didnt even eat half of her stew  Overall a disappointing experience 
R0116,The California chicken sandwich was lovely as was the soup of the day  roast sweet potato  Nice spot  good coffee also and a big window to stare out of  Recommended 
R0116,The Pre Theatre Menu was amazing   Particularly the soup of smoked Haddock   Mussel and Dill was the best soup I have ever tasted ever  
R0116,The service was very slow and the food was very bland   Our table was uncomfortable   seating was very tight    Overall very disappointed 
R0116,The waiters were nice   but not Irish  Given that this is touted as an Irish establishment  I would have expected at least one greeting with an Irish accent   Never mind   If the food would have been decent  that could be overlooked   The food was just about edible  thats the best I can say about it   Dont order the Irish stew  the meat was chewy and frankly  I couldnt be bothered to finish grinding my way through it   It was my friends daughters birthday so she ordered some chocolate cake   which was so stale you could hardly put a fork through it   And it was the same price as the restaurant wed been to the evening before which was superb    So well overcharging for what you got 
R0116,They did not honor the reservation  They say your cannot make reservation online  If so  they should not use the system   In the end  is seems like just a tourist trap 
R0116,Was v disappointed had lunch at 1 30 on a Saturday and place was completely empty  Service couldnt fault  Actual steak was nice but baked potato small and onions were awful salad came full of dressing  Food bland and no atmosphere so didnt hang around  Would never go bacK  I didnt point any of this out on the day and shoukd have really 
R0116,We came accross this place quite by accident  The food and service was wonderful we would return here and recommend this restaurant to anyone 
R0116,"We read about the recent reviews and thought it would be a great place to have our dinner  it turned out quite disappointed    I dont know it is because of Monday night  

First of all  menu price on online app did not match what listed at the restaurant  I understand sometimes price slightly raise up every year because of the inflation  But that was not in our case  I really want to try the Irish stew  online app listed  Euro 8 while restaurant listed  Euro 19   I asked if there are small portions of the stew at lower price  the waiter said no  Surprise  

Hubby ended up ordering the lamb special for the night after hearing the next table of 6 all ordered that  with waiters recommendation   it turned out the four thin lamb cutlets are dry as wood    and the mint sauce is the worst we ever had  We look over the table beside us  theirs were not much better 

I ordered the house special combo platter  ribs  wings  onion rings and scampi   Ribs are ok  it came in later on a side plate I dont know why   Wings are horrible  very dry  very bland   Scampi    all I tasted were the batter  cant even tell what is inside  And no sauce was provided when the platter was presented  I had to request the sauce afterwards    

The waiter is nice  He took pictures for us and tried his best    but I am sorry    the food quality is really not there  We end up paying  Euro 46 for the two dishes with sparking water  not even alcohol   We really felt this is the worst we had with the price we paid for   "
R0116,We travel the world and have gone to many restaurants   Based on the description was expecting something different  The food was not that good 
R0116,Went there for diner with a fried nd  it is a nice restaurant to enjoy french simple food  Enjoyed the atmosphere
R0117,We enjoyed the evening  It was a real Irish pub experience that we will remember  While the noise level was high  the ambience was real 
R0118,I eat here all the time and am usually always delighted with my meal  and consider this one of the best Chinese restaurants in Dublin  However my visit on Saturday was absolutely terrible  We were left waiting for 40 minutes for even our drinks to arrive  and our food much longer that came in such different time frames that the main was cold by the time the rice arrived  The aubergine was undercooked and raw in places  and the chitterlings were not crispy or cooked enough  A really disappointing experience from a restaurant that can do better 
R0118,Really disappointed in this establishment  17 euro should get you more than having to ask someone to pour you ice cream  Not allowed to use the ice cream machine on your own is absolutely absurd  �Multiple meat dishes couldve have easily been dog for all I know  Do not go 
R0118,This is so upsetting to have to write  but I am just so confused as to what happened  The food took forever to come  we waited while other people who sat after us to get their food delivered  finished eating  and left before our food came  The others got the same food as us too  fish and chips  There was no apology either when the food finally came  The whole ordeal took 3 hours  Is it because we are American  We were sat first bc the bartender was so nice to us  He was upset when my husband bumped into him on the way to the bathroom and told him we were still waiting on our appetizer  I dont know what to say other than our experience   it seems everyone else had a good experience  I dont know what fell apart but an apology wouldve gone a long way 
R0119, I would have preferred the mushrooms to be slightly cooked and it was perfect
R0119,"Awful experience  The waiters were rude from the very moment we entered  

When we asked the bill they even requested a tip saying it was by law while clearly this is not true in Ireland  

I will never go back again "
R0119,Excellent food  Great portions  You wont leave hungry  Ask for the Guinness Bread  
R0119,Great place to start our pub crawl  Good food  Great people 
R0119,"I really like this place  The surroundings are pleasant and quirky  Staff are very friendly and welcoming for the most part  

A nice alternative to the more traditional pubs in the area 

I have never had any food so I cannot comment on that  Yet 

My biggest gripe with this place is their God damned fridges not being at the right temperature 

A few weeks back I was here and ordered Veltin Pilsner  Its in a bottle so comes from the fridge  The beer was not cold enough  I like this beer and I just asked for a glass of ice to cool it which as any beer drinker knows this is not appropriate behaviour  But like most Irish people  I dont like to cause a fuss whilst in company in a pub  I drank 2 or 3 of these and each time the temperature did not improve so I just kept asking for ice 

I presumed they had maybe just stocked up the fridge with these beers which would explain why these were not cold enough  Either way  its not acceptable to serve beer from a fridge that is not cold enough  especially at these prices 

So I was here on Sunday  and presuming that my previous experience was just a once off I again ordered a bottle of Veltin  It arrived and was NOT cold enough  AGAIN 

My boyfriend is Brazilian and doesnt suffer from Irish politeness syndrome and insisted I sent it back especially as this had happened before  I called over one of the serving staff and told her it was not cold enough and could she get me another one  She came back saying the fridges are at a certain temperature and that any other bottle is going to be the same temperature  She offered to get ice or to choose something else 

I chose something else  I ordered a Tiger as it was on draft and would be significantly colder  

Then she disappeared  A few minutes had passed and I had to approach another staff member about my missing Tiger  It had been sitting on the bar and the girl was no where to be found  She probably went on a break or something and listen that is grand  we forget things  Its fine  Im sure it was a busy weekend for these guys but as a result of all this fapping about I was sitting with no drink for about 15 minutes whilst my boyfriend was enjoying his  It also means we will be out of sync with our round which is very important to us Irish 

Lads  PLEASE sort out your fridges  I want to come back and drink what I like  not what I have to order instead due to your fridges not being at the correct temperature "
R0119,Service was very poor  streak had to be send back  dont even pour you water etc  not what I expected
R0119,Wonderful meal and good service would definitely recommend
R0119,Your waiter told me I had not booked when I had booked  He was passive aggressive and make comments about our food portions  My friend had strawberries for dessert and when she asked for sugar he committed loudly WOW you want sugar with all that  Disappointed as I brought my French friend and mum but it was embarrassing 
R0120,Nice place for a good hardy breakfast  No waiting  service was good  I had a traditional Irish breakfast 
R0120,After a week in Portugal this is heaven  Classic Fish and Chips and Pesto Pasta  Deelish    Cold Guinness too  Life is good 
R0120,As always  the place was excellent  Food and service magnificent 
R0120,Both food and service were excellent  I would highly recommend this restaurant
R0120,Dont eat there  Shitty place and terrible service  They dont do well under pressure and I dont know why anyone would go there  What a waste of my time 
R0120,Extremely enjoyable evening  very relaxing  attentive  and  extremely professional staff  Excellent food  and  choice  Looking forward to our next visit  Well done 
R0120,fabulous; for value   food and service this is still the best lunch in the city
R0120,Find the place  great steaks staff is friendly what can you say    Highly recommended 5 star place for meat lovers 
R0120,Food and service was very good  but as my wife said for New Years Eve the wow factor 
R0120,Food great  Atmosphere super  Everyone friendly    Live entertainment not so loud that it inhibits chatting    Thanks Mo for the Wonderful service 
R0120,Food lovely  as always  Waiter forgot to bring the potatoes so by the time they arrived we were half way through our main course  Also we prefer if our wine is left beside us so we can pour it ourselves at our pace  
R0120,Food was amazing;service was attentive but not intrusive
R0120,Forset and Marcy whales over this place   The service here left much to be desired vacillating between frenetic and neglectful   The wine steward lacked elegance  the ma�tre dh�tel was arrogant and unwelcoming casting an unfavorable shadow on an otherwise talented but possibly overrated kitchen   The butternut risotto dish was excellent as was the apple souffle 
R0120,"Frequent  customer 
Never disappoints 
Suberb 
Fabulous food and fabulous service    
Highly recommended "
R0120,Great food and fabulous service  havent been in a while but will be back soon 
R0120,Great little cafe with healthy nutritious food  Really good combinations of ingredients  Coffee is so good  Worth the wait for a table 
R0120,Had a fabulous evening with really excellent food and advice from the sommelier  Highly recommend for a special night out 
R0120,Had lunch here today for my wifes birthday which was said in my booking and it would have been nice to be acknowledged   Apart from this  there was a warm welcome to be fair and the service was good to start  Starter came which was reasonable good  We had both ordered a slow cooked beef for mains which came out and looked really tasty   after tasting mine  it was extremely tough but my wifes was lovely so I sent mine back  The new dish took a long time to come back out and my wife had finished her main course about 10 minutes before my new dish came and as a result  our wine had gone too  They topped up our glass by about a cm but to be honest  I didnt feel this was enough given we were eating our main course separately    Overall  for  Euro 180  had a cheese board and ordered another glass of wine too   it really was mediocre and I would have expected more from this restaurant  
R0120,Halal grilled chicken burger  Try it with hot sauce  yummy  And you wont want to miss the rosemary fries 
R0120,I visited this restaurant twice in a week for business dinners and both times the Food was very good but the service was slow  and  poor  it was difficult to get the attention of the waiting staff which is frustrating and disappointing when you have guests  they seemed to me to be understaffed 
R0120,"I visited this place on a Wednesday evening  Ive previously dined there for lunch and have always loved the decor and the quality of the food 
"
R0120,"In my opinion it is overpriced and totally lacking in atmosphere  The dining room was less than half full  despite our reservation being for 8 30pm
on a Friday night "
R0120,It felt like no major effort was made  The staff were nice but appeared very quiet and lacking a bit of rapport  One thing which stood out was how incredibly small the starter and main course portions were  The dessert was perfect size  There was literally nothing left on our plates  We really dislike big portions and find them off putting  however  for the first time ever  we found ourselves shocked at how small these portions were  Room for improvement 
R0120,It is simply one of best restaurant in Dublin Great value  pefect service and quality of the food is outstanding   Highly recommended 
R0120,Lovely food  reasonably priced  great ambiance  Visited with four other friends and we would all highly recommend  Service was very very good too 
R0120,Lunch service took too long  over two hours  I dont mind fine dining being a slower service but there were long 40 minute gaps between plates 
R0120,My Cod was more delicious than I can describe 
R0120,My favourite place right now for healthy brunching/lunching  I love it here  I am a huge fan of the chickpea burger or the harissa chicken with green beans and sweet potato  Their desserts are epic   brownie/blondie brownie  and  the peanut butter smores are delicious 
R0120,No atmosphere  A little stuffy which is quite unusual these days  Overpriced     Euro 5 50 outrageous for a coffee  Food was very good 
R0120,One of my favourite restaurants in Dublin   Great food  delicate and full of various nicely balanced flavours  Warm welcome and service  Lovely room 
R0120,Really disappointed  eaten here before and liked it but really poor menu  mediocre food and really expensive  Dont recommend it at all 
R0120,Small amounts of lovely food with great attention to detail 
R0120,"Thank you so much  

We have a lovely lunch   It was special treat 

The staff  food and service were outstanding  

Look forward to dining with you again "
R0120,"The flavours and quality of the food was very good  but the portion sizes were so ridiculously small that we cannot rate you any higher  To be honest 
when we went back to our hotel we ordered some food "
R0120,The food quality was excellent but the service was not good  Staff chatting to each other in the lobby rather than attending to patrons   despite the fact that as early diners we were practically alone in the restaurant  The offer of drinks and taking of food orders were very slow 
R0120,The food was pretty good but the service was so so awful  15 mind waiting to even order a drink  Very slow between courses  One of our mains orders was gotten wrong so one of us couldnt eat at the same time and they barely even apologized and there was no offer of a small discount as a result  Nobody asked us how our food was and they didnt care when we said we were disappointed
R0120,The Xmas menu was 75 euros   I had scallops   5 euros extra   and the beef   10 euros extra     I could cook this myself for 10eorus   Resonable bottle of valpolacell cam in at 56 E   God know what the mark was on that nad then then total bill for  3 was 315 which with a tip came to 120 which included 10 percent on the bottle of wine which was loaded to begin with   So very poor value   
R0120,They boast Restaurant quality food for collection and delivery  Eh  maybe they need to re think this slogan  If I had been given this food in a restaurant  I would never eat there again  Expensive  greasy  slow delivery service  cold food on arrival 1 hour 25 mins after it was ordered  At least had the food been of good quality it would not have been so bad  18 95 for starter and main course to be delivered  might as well have eaten in the restaurant  �Dont waste your money on this place  order from your usual reliable take away 
R0120,They were closed when we arrived for our reservation  We phoned and there was no answer  The internet said they were open  but they were not  Very disappointed  From the U S 
R0120,This is a fabulous restaurant   great food  great wine and decent service  If you are a foodie youll love this place  Highly recommend 
R0120,This is the best restaurant in Dublin  it has everything from fabulous service to the most amazing food  ever in Dublin be sure to visit
R0120,Very bad experience for expensive place 
R0120,Very good restaurant for a quiet and important business lunch in Dublin  The food is excellent  light and very well presented  Staff is attentive  and  extremely professional  Highly recommended if you are looking for a high level fine dining venue that is also cosy and intimate 
R0120,We had an extraordinary experience  The food was amazing and the staff far superior to any we have previously encountered 
R0120,We have come here on several occasions we hadnt been in a while  Very disappointed in the food also the price didnt reflect the quality of food 
R0120,We have eaten here a number of times and is normal great  however got the fish this time and it was raw  the staff were very nice however  they only took  Euro 10 of the bill for the fish being raw  which I felt was not good enough 
R0120,We made reservations to eat here on our last night in Dublin  Because of a change in location and Google maps it was difficult to find  We finally found it and were seated at a lovely table  Unfortunately the night we dined there was also a large business group in the same room  As the evening went on  they got louder and louder  We placed our order for drinks and it took quite a while to get them  Dinner took an hour and fifteen minutes to receive  Our white wine was kept in an ice bucket away from the table and our glasses were empty more than with wine  I think we were forgotten as couples who came in after us received their meals before us  It was when we finally inquired about our food that it was delivered ten minutes later  It may have been the large business group but it did seem severely understaffed on the night we visited  The food was fine  nothing too memorable  Not sure it was worth a visit on our last night of vacation 
R0120,"We had the Thai noodles and the beef Szechuan 
Noodles were edible but that beef was horrible 
Unfortunately I dont thin Ill  come again for the food "
R0120,We went for early bird as we had a show to get to  Whilst all food was delicious and wine was fantastic I felt the goats cheese main was more a starte than a main course
R0120,"We went to the new place which opened up on the Quays and were sorely disappointed 

I got a burrito bowl with chicken and the food was bland  with cold cheese and runny sauce covering everything  

I wouldnt recommend this place "
R0120,We were quite disappointed with our dinner   We were there before about 2 3 years ago on a pre theatre menu  and I remember it was a great experience  This time we went for dinner  Everything started poorly  as we were seated next to a loud group of people  There were only 3 course set menus available  which was quite a lot for us  as we dont eat that much  The food was good  but I was expecting something better  The presentation of the dishes was fantastic  Unfortunately  the taste didnt follow on the same level  Overall  that was a good but pricey dinner  For three people with a total of 5 glasses of wine  we paid 270 Euro  plus a tip 
R0120,went due to reviews  was not disappointed  Great music and really nice people there good drinks  great atmosphere 
R0120,Went twice  should have learned a lesson the first time   Do not mind paying for quality however the portions are tiny  very out of proportion in terms of expense  Very expensive  thimble size bites of meat and rushed service until the end of the meal 
R0121,"i have seen some of the food in here and have never been tempted to get it at all  it just does not look appealing at all and there are far better looking choices in the shopping centre 

this is a mediocre bar for watching sport  there are screens but i dont think they are well placed  but in fairness its not really a sporting bar and i dont think it was laid out with televisions in mind  no harm really 

I am not a fan of this pub at night and i do not like the night club at all  its too small and im not sure if i like the type of people who go there either 

the toilets are bad in here by the way"
R0121, Something that has to be experienced at least once  Steaks are great along with the optional sides  Onion strings are amazing  Have the New York Strip a faultless piece of meat  Ordering steak is a must here otherwise its a waste journey as the quality is out of this world  Atmosphere can be a little stuffy at times but you expect this so just go with it 
R0121,A really poor experience considering the compliments Ive hear people give about this place  My  Euro 11 cocktail tasted like water  and despite two servers confirming I could get the Pad Thai without chilli it still was full of it  Nobody came to check on us during the food despite different servers looking at my full plate with wonder as they walked by as if their attitude was �not my problem�   When my boyfriend was finished his food they came over and basically just said �oh� and offered me a replacement  I declined  and while they did take it off the bill  after that nobody came to our table to offer tea or desert or see if we wanted another drink  After 30 minutes of trying to make eye contact I had to wave somebody over and ask for the bill  She then forgot and 15 minutes later rushed over and apologised  If it was busy I would have understood but we were one of maybe 10 tables in this large location   Definitely wont be back 
R0121,Amazing food  cocktail and staff  I am in love with this place  My favorite restaurant  
R0121,As always food and service was excellent  couldnt fault a thing 
R0121,Been a few times and always cant wait to go back  Love this place 
R0121,Best restaurant honestly    Everything was delicious and the gluten free options were great as well  Will definitely be coming back soon 
R0121,Birthday dinner  A friend had a severe  allergic reaction and the response from the restaurant was atrocious  Looking into going legal with the level of negligence experienced 
R0121,Brunch menu wasnt on  despite having it on website  Not a single other person there at 2pm on a Saturday  No servers came to see if we wanted to order food so we just had coffee and left 
R0121,Disappointing   Maybe because it was a Wednesday night but food was okay but nothing special   Server was pleasant but had an �I dont care� attitude and never came to check on us our entire meal 
R0121,"Drinks were great  However  food was not up to the standard I expected  I ordered the Duck with asian greens and received a bowl of soy sauce with a few pieces of duck  some bok choi swimming in it and no other greens  I ate half a chilli in one mouthful and it ruined the rest of main which wasnt very nice anyway  2 of the other 3 friends that were with me felt their mains werent good either  Desserts were beautiful as were the cocktails  
I would go back for drinks but not for food "
R0121,Enjoyable evening  Friendly and knowledgable staff  Food is good without being spectacular  Nice ambiance 
R0121,Food and service excellent but the restaurant was extremely noisy  There were not a lot of diners at that point and the music was not overly loud but the area seemed unusually noisy  It was difficult to speak to my husband opposite me at the table without shouting  It must be the building itself but we ended up cutting our evening short and didnt stay for dessert for this reason 
R0121,Food was absolutely delicious and staff were so friendly and went above and beyond for us   We will definitely be back again 
R0121,"Food was amazing and always is 
Great service from Thomas as well"
R0121,"Good food in a really relaxed atmosphere  Easily transitioned from food to drinks 
"
R0121,Good Indian restaurant  The portions are huge so they are perfect for sharing the Currys are delicious  Service is normally good but can be slow
R0121,Great restaurant and fantastic food  The service was good 
R0121,I like the way they cook veggies here  Its always very tasty with friendly service  The only small negative is that it gets cramped sometimes 
R0121,I love this place  great food  and great service  Worth a visit 
R0121,"Ive heard a lot about this place as a  going out one for the weekend  But I read over here it is also a restaurant so I decided to come with a friend to celebrate my birthday 
We came on a Wednesday and the waiter told us there was a special promotion so we could get any 2 courses for a fixed amount of money 
I had the omelette Pad Thai and it was really good  The other course was Lime Chicken and the quantity of food was not that much  but still nice 
However  when we wanted to pay  the waiter took the card and the bill and never gave us back the last one  just the receipt of the payment of the card   We thought it was weird but when we got outside we realized: we got charged almost double the amount of the ""fixed"" price of the promotion the waiter promised us 
Really bad experience  not coming any time soon again "
R0121,It is a great place if you want to spend a nice night and share with friends or family
R0121,It is completely unnecessary to blast music at full volume in the restaurant  As loud as the music was  it didnt drown out the noise of the door to the toilets  Surely this could be easily addressed  This is a venue for parties or hen/stag nights 
R0121,"It is one the Dublin s Major street  A lot of tourists  We were touring Dublin and saw this place during lunch hour  The name sounded like a big restaurant  

However  after we paid in advance and went to the buffet  we were just disappointed  The food were stale with very limited selection  It tasted even worse  After trying out a little  we decided to just leave  We were afraid we would get sick  

I did not have data service to check review first  as we are in Dublin from the USA for only 3 days 

Please stay safe  Dont eat here "
R0121,It is rather pricy but excellent food  I would not make it my regular dining spot due to the price but for now and then its great
R0121,Last night in Ireland excellent service here
R0121,Normally this place is great but the wait was so long during lunchtime that I had to leave  Waiting 45 mins for food to find out we were still 8 tables behind  Obviously issues in the kitchen but no communication from staff till we asked the situation  Pretty surprised at how poor it was 
R0121,Not a bad restaurant  but was really empty when there and lacking in atmosphere 
R0121,Our waiter did not bring our change which was quite signicant  As it was a friends birthday we did not want to draw attention to this  Was not impressed by the service 
R0121,Really nice food  Staff were very friendly and service was very good  Nice spacious table and good atmosphere   Reasonably priced too  Will definitely eat there again
R0121,Tasty food  fab cocktails and brilliant service  Will be back again soon 
R0121,The caprese salad is outrageously overpriced for what it is  I paid  Euro 17 for that  plus a regular coke  When the dish arrived  it was literally four slices of mozzarella and four slices of tomato with a small dash of dressing  In addition  we waited over 30 minutes for our mains  even though the restaurant was not busy and all our orders were very basic  Having said that  the host was pleasant and the decor and ambiance is lovely  Unfortunately I probably wont be returning 
R0121,"We also purchased the raspberry pistachio tart    tasted like a cracker that fell apart in your mouth  The fork couldnt even penetrate the tart without using strong force and there was a whole lot of flavor going on  Almost lost a tooth chewing the raspberry assortment  Last but not least I got I cant recall  but it looked like a fluffy white pastry with delicious chocolate chips but biting into it    had the texture of styrofoam  the taste of crunchy air and was so bland I couldnt take another bite 
"
R0121,The food was delicious and the atmosphere is great
R0121,The pizza is the best in Dublin  Highly recommend it  The whole staff is Italian and the space was just renovated  A large pizza can easily be shared by two people
R0121,This place won me over with its excellent smoking room  Feels like youre outside but still warm and cosy 
R0121,Took my mum here for the mothers day and need to say service and the food wad outstanding    Cant wait to come back    Highly recomend 
R0121,Very enjoyable  excellent service and great atmosphere and drinks menu
R0121,Very good Asian fusion restaurant on George street   Great for a nice dinner out  witch a cocktail lounge connected to it as well 
R0121,Waiter wasnt friendly and arrogant not welcome and the glasses very dirty I didnt drink my juice
R0121,Was here for lunch for two  We ordered the chicken supreme and fish pie and we were both very pleased with our dishes  the desserts were lovely too 
R0121,We dined here on a deal and we werent treated very well  They queried the voucher validity and asked me to log onto my email on my phone to prove where the voucher came from  We purchased the voucher for a 3 course meal and they claimed it was for a 2 course even though it said 3 course on the voucher  They delayed us by questioning us  we were late for the show after  It ruined our whole night being embarrassed like this 
R0122,Amazing experience from start to finish  Waiter very helpful describing some parts of the menu when asked  Didnt feel rushed to leave the table
R0122,Amazing food  great service and the drinks menu can cater for all  Thanks team 
R0122,Excellent food and service  Highly recommend
R0122,Gorgeous food and pleasant service  Really nice atmosphere
R0122,Great food beautiful location 
R0122,Great food not too noisy 
R0122,Great place  Staff always friendly and efficient  Food always superb  Great spot for dinner before a show 
R0122,I didnt attend this lunch myself but the feedback was very positive 
R0122,Second time visiting the place and loved it  We all had starters   the Burrata salad which was delicious  Then pizza and pasta for main courses  All very good  Highly recommend 
R0122,Super food in a really pleasant environment staff are fantastic
R0122,"7:45 p m  reservations   seated at 8:00 p m  Our food finally arrived at 9:30 p m  An hour and 1/2 waiting for a bowl of spaghetti and a cheese pizza  Seriously terribly long wait for food  The table next to us had the same experience  Although two male servers were ""very"" attentive to the table of young girls who were seated an hour after us   serving their food and beverages in a timely manner  Disappointed and will not recommend "
R0122,80 Euro  for 2 people    2 drinks each  gin and beer  and 2 pizzas  They brought out a dessert for my partners birthday which was a nice touch but then charged us for it  Overall a grand experience but I wont be rushing back 
R0122,A good solid enjoyable meal  Always a pleasure  A vibrant place with great staff and food to match
R0122,A great meal as always   food  service and restaurant are fantastic
R0122,A hidden gem   Make sure to book in advance  Food is outstanding  creative and well crafted 
R0122,A little expensive but food was lovely ad service was great  The tiramasui was a huge hit 
R0122,A really nice place for lunch  Coffee is also great 
R0122,Absolutely amazing food and service  Got the big lucio and every course was amazing  Waiter absolutely fantastic  Great wine 
R0122,Absolutely Amazing     We/I had the best evening   From the moment we arrived we were treated like VIPs  Very friendly and helpful staff  Very attentive but not over the top  Food was outstanding and the wine was gorgeous  I highly recommend this place  even for a coffee  its such a beautiful place  Will definitely be back again 
R0122,"Absolutely amazing           
Great food  great service   great atmosphere "
R0122,Amazing breakfast   Staff were super friendly and made us feel very welcome  Worth seeking out this little place for breakfast
R0122,"Amazing food and service 

We went for the tasting menu which was a great way of trying loads of different items off the menu  Id highly recommend it but make sure you come hungry as there is alot of food to get through  Leaving room for dessert is a must  We had the tiramisu which was the best one Ive had in recent times  Thats saying alot having just returned from a weeks holiday in Italy where that was my dessert of choice  

Id like to wish the business continued success and look forward to my next visit there "
R0122,Another fabulous experience   Looking forward to the next time    Will be back 
R0122,Beautiful food    excellent service  great ambience
R0122,Beautiful meal  food was lovely and good choice on pre theatre menu 
R0122,Beef ragu was dry  Service was meh  
R0122,Beef ragu was dry  Wine was good  Affogato was good  Service was meh  Took them a 15 mins to see that our dishes were empty and then to clear our table  then we had to ask twice for another bottle of water  then it took another 10 mins to pay after asking for the bill  Service was generally a bit slow all night 
R0122,Been going here for years  Consistently fantastic and never disappoints 
R0122,Best fish and chips we had in our 10 day journey around Ireland   The music was great    the staff was very friendly    my new favorite pub in Dublin 
R0122,Best food Ive had in a long time  Staff were amazing 
R0122,Booked restaurant for pre theatre outing with my mum  and  her friend    fab a la carte or pre theatre menu options  We opted for the baked olives to start which were amazing   never had olives quite like this before even when i lived in Greece  Dinner was a fab follow up   smoked duck was devoured by all and mum commented best hake ever   Cocktails were also pretty good overall fab food fab ambiance and great staff   would highly recommend
R0122,Busy Saturday in the run up to Christmas but no need for staff to be rude
R0122,Cool location  super service and the food was very  very good  Decent wine list and the grilled octopus appetizer and wood fire pizzas were awesome 
R0122,Cuisine was outstanding   Wine was delicious   Staff was all very accommodating and attentive 
R0122,My pasta had about 2 half pieces of  broken up prawns in it and was borderline over cooked  The tiramisu was fairly dry too  As I said Im a big fan but the food was disappointing this time 
R0122,Definitely a big fan of the restaurant  usually go for work lunches  we booked for dinner  The food is usually really good but I have to say I was disappointed this time  We didnt even get the early bird and went full a la carte  The gnocchi with beef was a bit like irish stew with very large chunks of beef in it and overly soft gnocchi  and was very under seasoned  My pasta had about 2 half pieces of  broken up prawns in it and was borderline over cooked  The tiramisu was fairly dry too  As I said Im a big fan but the food was disappointing this time 
R0122,Delicious authentic Italian food  Nicely decorated  informal setting 
R0122,Delicious Italian cuisine  fresh ingredients  great value  We went with the tasting menu and its was well worth it  an abundance of food 
R0122,"Disappointing venue for private parties 
Not the way to get customers to come back again and again 
"
R0122,Easy walk   friendly staff and lovely food  You feel welcome and staff seem happy  Good pre theatre menu 
R0122,Excellent as usual  food  service and atmosphere is very friendly
R0122,Excellent authentic Italian restaurant   Great as pre theatre spot
R0122,Excellent cocktails  super fresh seafood  beautiful ambiance  This is a great place to get a healthy gourmet meal in Dublin 
R0122,Excellent food  reasonable portions  amazing cocktails and dessert   Highly recommend the tiramisu
R0122,Excellent selection of healthy and delicious foods  smoothies and juices  I tried the protein balls and loved them all  Definitely will go back 
R0122,Exceptional
R0122,Fab atmosphere and setting  Lovely for a catch up and ideal for a pre theatre meal
R0122,Fab service from beginning till the end  Great staff and the food was beautiful and a cracking espresso martini to finish it all off
R0122,Fabulous food and service  great atmosphere  Will definitely be back
R0122,Fabulous food  great service and great atmosphere  Alley a bit dark outside  Def will return 
R0122,Fabulous meal  Would highly recommend and will be back 
R0122,First time visiting restaurant  Really good honest italian food presented well by excellent friendly staff 
R0122,Food is exquisite and Spritz is really authentic  making me always eager to go whenever I miss Italy 
R0122,Food left a lot to desire
R0122,Food ok  wine not very nice  service a bit rushed 
R0122,Food ok  wine not very nice  service a bit rushed  
R0122,Food was decent  service was awful  The waiters were very nice but the management staff was very rude and dismissive towards us  Dont go here if youre looking to be properly attended and respected 
R0122,Food was good  not great  Pretty pricey for a simple plate of pasta or pizza  Very noisy space 
R0122,Food was good  However  very poor Service  I booked 2 days in advance when we came  2 adults and a teenage boy  they wanted to give us the table in the very end of the room  When I protested they said all the other tables were reserved and that we only could have this other table right in the corridor  at that time the restaurant was still almost empty  Such behaving upsets me a lot  as if I had asked for the worst table in advance  and all the other later coming guests would have named their preferred tables  Its a cheap excuse 
R0122,Food was poor  Ordered seafood pasta dish  approx two prawns in it cut up to make it look like more  
R0122,Food was poor  Ordered seafood pasta dish  approx two prawns in it cut up to make it look like more  Very little flavour 
R0122,"From the moment we sat down our whole experience was amazing  our waitress was so lovely   my husband asked her if they sold one of the dressings   she organised it with the manager  and  gave us a parting gift of a bottle  he was thrilled  
The food was superb from stater to dessert   my main the ravioli was just mouthwatering   My husband had the steak with cabbage  and  delicious  Would highly recommend  and  cant wait to go back  and  try the pizza  "
R0122,Generally not bad  service not great  food good  but certainly not value for money 
R0122,Good food lots of staff running around  Little bit claustrophobic to be honest  Had to ask front of house to replenish toilet roll

R0122,Had a fabulous time   Would highly recommend for any occasion   Very relaxed vibe with total sophistication   Wonderful food   Wonderful staff  Loved it 
R0122,Had expected really good food based on reviews but was v disappointed 
R0122,Had food there while staying in Dublin  Small steaks for price but still tasted unbelievable  Possibly all Dublin steak prices are similar 
R0122,Have been to this restaurant on three occasions within the last year and always found it to be quite enjoyable with great food  pleasant staff and lively atmosphere  Unfortunately on this occasion it had not met up to previous visits  The quality of food vastly disimproved  A starter of flatbread with lemon yogurt and minced lamb a lot to be desired you would have had to search with a beedy eye to see let alone taste the lamb    should have been quite tasty but just a flatbread with a slaver of yogurt not great   A beautifully described meat dish on menu basically turned out to be a tasty enough ragu with tagliatelle but for  Euro 22    A tad steep I thought   As for the steak it used to be served on a fresh bed of peppery rocket but now changed to finely shredded white cabbage not a great pairing  please return to the rocket   Spaghetti with clams  they were very hit and miss     Atmosphere still great though and staff very pleasant but disappointing on the food front    Im not looking to review this restaurant for fine dining but as a casual restaurant with tasty everyday food for value and on  this occasion it had not lived up to previous visits   Sorry but will not be back

R0122,"Heard lots of great reviews about the chicken wings and certainly wasnt disappointed  They are quality  Meaty generous portions and the sauce is amazing  The blue cheese dip could be better 

Really nice friendly staff and great atmosphere  I went Sunday day it was quite busy but wasnt waiting too long 

 definitely go back "
R0122,GO SOMEWHERE ELSE  PLEASE do not go here  Listen to me 
R0122,I chose the Apis pizza and its the best pizza Ive ever had 
R0122,I generally do love coming to this place  the decor is fab and the service  and  food is normally great  Today the chicken I ordered was just so so  I didnt finish it  however I will say this is not normal for them  normally the food is great so perhaps the chef was having an off day  It wont put me off returning 
R0122,I had a green smoothie and a Tuna bagel  The service was fast enough and everything was excellent  The place is very small  its better to take away 
R0122,I love this place  great food  lovely atmosphere and staff are very friendly  Very good value too 
R0122,I loved it  great food  lovely atmosphere and staff are very friendly  Very good value too

I am looking forward to my booking "
R0122,I really love going to this restaurant  It is my favourite kind of food and my favourite Italian Restaurant in Dublin  
R0122,I was disappointed with the tasting menu  
R0122,I was disappointed with the tasting menu not good
R0122,Incredible home made pastas   Truly wonderful experience 
R0122,Its a pity this place has only one salad on the menu for lunch time  but would have expected a really innovative and special salad for  Euro 18   but it was really disappointing in every way for that price  The rest of the food  i e  pastas etc  looked good but I can only judge the place on what I had  Very basic chicken salad with leaves  some avocado and tomato  no bread offered  Feel completely ripped off

R0122,"Lively spot and great selection of beverage plus tasty food 
Talented Irish musicians entertain only the way Dubliners can "
R0122,Loved the ambiance  Disappointed with food  brushetta bread so hard could not eat and prawn linguine had about 3 prawns in it   at24e thats not good enough  Service good 
R0122,Loved it  Elegant but not too pretentious   Staff wonderfully friendly and attentive enough 
R0122,Lovely    delicious pizza 
R0122,Lovely food; pizzas are just great  wonderful service   And quick  just perfect 
R0122,Lovely restaurant with great food and a nice ambience and very friendly staff

R0122,Lovely restaurant  food was beautiful especially rhubarb panne cotta  service friendly and efficient  definitely will return
R0122,"Lovely  will visit again 
Maybe a few more vegetarian options"
R0122,Me and my boyfriend went few times for dinner  Everytime  time  food was amazing and service even nice   highly recommend   never disappointed   so far�
R0122,Nice venue  good service but a very unbalanced main course  We had the chicken dish on the pre theatre menu  It was undoubtedly very tasty but had too much meat and too little veg  Very unbalanced   The panacotta was very small in a very big dish Also the carafe of tap water was warm  Overall I dont think it was value for money 
R0122,Nice variety of menu options  attentive staff  very tasty food
R0122,One of our favorites   Consistently good   Food fab
R0122,Our reservation was confirmed and the restaurant was closed  
R0122,Totally irresponsible
R0122,Outstanding food and a buzzing atmosphere  Will definitely return soon 
R0122,Overrated and overpriced 
R0122,A superficial and narcissistic environment  small portions of mediocre food  a good buzz but thats about it 
R0122,"Perfect experience all over 
Food was delicious with amazing service"
R0122,Perfect place to have a lovely and romantic nite  Food amazing    The staff are super nice  Everything so perfect 
R0122,Perfect pre theater menu   excellent food   friendly fast and efficient service   No complaints
R0122,Pleasant atmosphere and wait staff  food beautiful  efficient service for pre theatre dining 
R0122,Poor food  drinks and service  do not recommended 
R0122,Poor food  drinks and service  do not recommended  Nothing good
R0122,Possibly the worst cooked Italian pasta I have ever eaten
R0122,Possibly the worst cooked pasta I have ever eaten
R0122,Pre theatre deal is excellent value  Excellent food and atmosphere
R0122,Food was OK   had pizza and to be honest youll get better in Dublin nearby  Service was good to start with but as soon as we received our mains  we were pretty much forgotten about 
R0122,Pretty average restaurant  In a nice location and looks like a nice building  however its very stuffy inside and the tables are a bit cramped 
R0122,Previously reviewed  an old favourite 
R0122,Really  enjoyed our pizza and wine pre theatre meal    lovely friendly staff     would definitely recommend
R0122,Really delighted with this restaurant  It was top class  The staff were so friendly too  We will definitely be back 
R0122,really impressed by the food   had a lovely evening  Drinks were expensive but well worth it 
R0122,Really lovely staff and food and wine  Top marks   Definitely return and recommend
R0122,Really nice meal  Good service  handmade pasta is great  good wine   all under vaulted ceilings   we loved it
R0122,Really nice menu selection  Loved the food and friendly fast service  Great spot for food before trip to the theatre  We will be back 
R0122,"Really nice place with great atmosphere  tasty food  and very nice staff   
Good choice for night out  "
R0122,Really nice Restaurant and in a great location for theatre etc   Great atmosphere and the food is superb 
R0122,When we arrived at this restaurant we were told we could not have a table for 3  So  us 3 mature women  were shown to a bench table with bar stools located at the door and place settings for 6  We ended up sharing the table with another couple  which obviously stifled our conversation  We ordered from the pre theatre menu  Food was tasty  yet barely a quick lunch portion size   Euro 110 for  three 2 course meals  3 glasses of house wine and 3 Americano coffees 
R0122,This restaurant is a dark and treacherous walk down a poorly lit and cobbled street  The customer service from the hostess was abismal  Wait Staff very friendly and efficient  Poor value for money  Will not return nor recommend 
R0122,Roasted olives were as hot as hell
R0122,Roasted olives were as hot as hell  Skip it
R0122,Save your money  Not worth it at all  Ran out of a few things on the menu  lobster  fish and partridge from a very limited menu to deign with  Then substituted with things not in the menu  Claimed they want to keep only the best ingredients  Really  We had a big group by the time the waiter got everyones order we all had different fish  The bread could probably be used as weapon it was so hard  The service felt cold as if they were just �going through the motions  No interaction with the group  
R0122,Service was friendly  attentive but not intrusive  Food was excellent  Great place for a casual meal with friends 
R0122,Staff couldnt have been nicer  or the food any better    Love this place   it just gets better and better    Theyre always upping their game
R0122,"Staff very very friendly  
Food excellent 
Will certainly return "
R0122,Start to finish everything was excellent  Highly recommend
R0122,Superb food in an exquisite restaurant  We will definitely revisit soon 
R0122,tagliatelle with duck ragu  extremely salty  no taste of duck  could have been any minced meat  sauce was a really strong beefy taste 
R0122,Tasty Italian cuisine   great service  cozy ambience
R0122,"The food was nice and great ambiance at the restaurant  Unfortunately  there was a mix up with my dish  as there were two dishes with an Italian name that sound quite similar and when ordering we intended to order a specific dish and the waitress confirmed the name as the other dish  not being Italian speakers we assumed it was the same dish so said that was right  When the dish came out we realised the mistake and I asked to swap it as I would not have enjoyed the dish that came out  It was a simple misunderstanding  but the waiter was quite rude and said ""so you want me to throw out this dish "" It made me feel quite awful  but it really was just a language based misunderstanding  I didnt just ""change my mind"" and would not have enjoyed my meal if I hadnt asked for the swap to the intended dish  I was quite taken aback and upset by the attitude as it was clearly a misunderstanding and you would not expect to get this type of attitude as a customer  I was very polite when making the request and expected the same in return "
R0122,The food was of very poor quality  I ordered the bruschetta to start  It appeared 30 seconds later  clearly been sitting there for a while  It was burnt  Not a little burnt  but burnt black  I couldnt eat most of it  I ordered the quail for mains  While it was ok  there was very little actual quail meat and practically nothing else on the plate to eat 
R0122,My partner had the fish and it was similarly mediocre  The bill came to 69 euro  Most definitely did not get 69 euro worth of food  Will not go back 
R0122,The food was really beautiful  However when we arrived with our 2 babies we were made feel as if  we were an inconvenience 
R0122,The guy at reception informed us that we couldnt bring the buggy into the restaurant due to limited space available  We have a new born baby  and  a 2 year old  We ended up sitting at a high table that the high chair was  half as tall as  therefor the baby would be practically sitting under the table  Then we were asked twice to move to allow a wheelchair come in  and  out  This I didnt mind so much but we werent offered as much as a drink  
R0122,The flatbread was not satisfying   different from foccacia  but not something youd order again  It all made me want to go back to Rome 
R0122,The green salad was delicious  The atmosphere was lively and cheerful  though mind your head  especially at the back of the restaurant   if you are tall   The wagyu ragu was oily and unpleasantly flavored  and decorated with a spray of individual rosemary needles  as if they were chives or parsley 
R0122,the new menu is really good but I think squid ink linguini should be on the menu again
R0122,the new menu is really good but I think squid ink linguini should be on the menu again  
R0122,The pizza was amazing and the other loved their pizza and pastas too  Would definitely recommend to a friend 
R0122,The pizzas  the wine and the staff were all excellent  
R0122,The service was outstanding  food was super tasty and the restaurant itself its gorgeous  Would definitely recommend it  Lovely fine dining 
R0122,"The warm olives are ""to die for"" "
R0122,They asked if I wanted some potatoes as the main came as just the fish by itself without any sides and they charged 6 euro for 4 tiny potatoes as a side  No chuffed 
R0122,This is one of �go to� places in town and its always great  
R0122,This is the only restaurant in Dublin to date that I have been to more than twice and I had a great meal every time  The menu changes regularly  which makes sense   so I had different dishes on each visit and I loved every bite  They also have a good selection of wines  Highly recommended 
R0122,This place is authentic and have an amazing   and ever changing    menu  We consider ourselves regulars
R0122,"This restaurant came highly recommended and have to say it disappointed  Service was very good but food quality was very poor given the prices  

Maybe got the them on bad night but no plans rush back "
R0122,This restraunt  and  bar is beuatiful   brilliant location   food is amazing   great service  and   the staff are very  friendly
R0122,"People arent kidding about the slow service  Took them ages to take our order  But the food came out fast enough  Although  they did take my steak back as I asked for medium rare and not well done  I was quite disappointed but then again my expectations of bear were high but was based on their dinner menu  The brunch menu isnt as meat focused and all the cuts of steak are SO THIN   The red cabbage salad I ordered was also a bit of a disappointment    The cocktails are super sweet and so Im glad I went with their Bloody Mary  


I still aim to sample their dinner menu as it looks phenom "
R0122,This was a spot Ive been dying to try out for numerous reasons but the main one is for their so called award winning wings  Which I would have to disagree with majorly due to the fact that the sauce was just not my cup of tea  it had a very ketchup taste to it  While I was massively disappointed with the wings 
R0122,"The price they charge is outrageous considering the food was so tasteless and of a very low standard  It was also noticeable that the restaurant was actually empty with only one other table of diners  
Perhaps they are busy with work lunch crowds but for evening meals this is just a terrible experience and I have no idea how they are still open serving such poor food at such insane prices   Also  our conversation was constantly interrupted by passing trains literally overhead  Not to mention how cramped the toilets were  Overall  there was this air of pretension but with absolutely nothing to back it up  
If you like good food of a high standard then AVOID this restaurant at all costs  One of the worst meals weve ever eaten  I do not like to give bad reviews but I felt so annoyed leaving this restaurant after paying so much for nothing  Just Horrible "
R0122,"This was one of the most overpriced meals Ive eaten based on nothing but sheer pretentiousness  The food was beyond basic  with the bruschetta being undressed and bland   flavourless main courses with no sides and extremely sweet  Everything tasted of sugar  Having lived in Italy I can assure you this is not good Italian food 
I reguarly dine in expensive restaurants and have no problem paying for quality "
R0122,Thoroughly enjoyed our lunch �get together �   Service was excellant   staff really welcoming and food was wonderful    In all a wonderful experience
R0122,Too loud to talk  The food is just okay but very expensive
R0122,Very busy as it was a pre Theatre dinner   staff were lovely  and  very efficient  Food was amazing   my friends loved it  and  we will definitely go back 
R0122,Very expensive for a piece of taglietine  Never again
R0122,Very good food  nice atmosphere and excellent service  Definitely going back  Bravi 
R0122,Very nice and cosy place  Friendly staff  Outstanding food 
R0122,Very nice experience   Fantastic food 
R0122,Was absolutely amazing  Pizza was the best Ive ever had  Will 100 percent be back and would recommend to anyone 
R0122,"We arrived a little late 9 45 
The staff were very anxious to get our orders in and when we asked for extra bread they said the kitchen was closed  

After dinner we ordered cheese which came with bread  
This was disappointing  
I have eaten in here many times and mostly the staff are very good but they let me down this time "
R0122,We came in and they claimed our reservation was canceled even though we didnt cancel it  They were able to seat us anyways at the bar  Food was good but pricey but we had 5 different people ask if we were ready to order which makes it seem like they wanted to get us out as quickly as possible despite the restrauant not being full  
R0122, Definitely didnt feel welcome here  Wait staff were very rude
R0122,We got table by the door in cold draft Food wasnt worth of money that my boyfriend paid They dont have many meat free options Vegetarian pizza that I ordered was just disgusting  Its nice place and staff is nice and welcoming but Im disappointed 
R0122,We had a great dinner  as usual  The food is always excellent and the service is top notch 
R0122,We had a lovely meal here on Saturday night we will definitely be back
R0122,We had high hopes for this restaurant   looks stylish  great location  Unfortunately  the dining experience was incredibly disappointing  
R0122,The starter  burrata with picked onions  and  heirloom tomatoes  was far too cold and tasteless  The tagliatelle with ragu sounded delicious but unfortunately  it was heavily salted and unpalatable  Pizza was admittedly good  We felt rushed through our meal  the staff were brusk and the food was too expensive for the quality delivered 
R0122,We had lunch to celebrate a work colleagues birthday  The base of my pizza was burnt 
R0122,We had such a great time  the food was fantastic and the staff were great  Will definitely come back 
R0122,"We had the tasting menu  Fab starters and dessert  underwhelming main course 
Service was great  Wine was very nice but not cheap "
R0122,We had the tasting menu   loved every minute cant wait to go back 
R0122,"We just loved it
 I truly recommend it  The staff is super nice and the food and beverages are really homemade  
I recommend it "
R0122,We went for our table  Taster menu  it was just an incredible food experience  It takes 2 5 hours and its a lot of food but it was so tasty  Great night and great service  highly recommended 
R0122,We were 10 minutes early and were placed at the bar to order a drink even though our table was ready  The noise level was very high and we were right beside a very noisy table of 8 women  Very poor vegetarian options 
R0122,We were seated close to the entrance on a cold night and there was a cold draught throughout the evening   I ordered a Tiramisu for dessert and asked for it with no icing sugar sprinkled on top  The waitress came back with a message from the chef saying that there is icing sugar in the Tiramisu  I found this very strange as it would make the Tiramisu sickly sweet  I therefore did not have a dessert   The use of icing sugar in the dessert is a very poor baking practice leading to very poor quality desserts 
R0122,We were very disappointed with this restaurant  It was extremely noisy 
R0122,Were rushed since the moment we arrived   Terrible
R0122,Weve eaten here quite a lot of times and its always excellent 
R0122,Went with my elderly father who is in a wheelchair  Could not have asked for better attention and service  Thank you  
R0122,What a poor excuse of a place  you ask the waiter for a focaccia and before even asking the chef he blatantly refuses  They offer an item already on the menu   which has nothing to do with a focaccia  Whilst the food is very good  the service is just as poor  Which authentic Italian restaurant serves coffee before dessert    More embarrassingly   so many misspelt ingredients on the menu  I would have revisited the restaurant again 
R0122,What a poor excuse  The poor service broke the camels back and unfortunately I will never set foot in the place again 
R0122,Will always be one of my favourite restaurants in Dublin   such a cosy setting with consistently great food and service 
R0122,Wonderful evening  wish we did not have to rush away to a show in the Bord Gais 
R0122,Wonderful starter mains and desert  Great old fashioned cocktail  Would highly recommend
R0122,Your octopus starter was the nicest starter Ive had in years  and youre polenta fries I could eat everyday forever
R0123,"Absolutely amazing staff and food  This will be ""our"" restaurant in Dublin  Loved everything "
R0123,Big comfortable smoking area  strong Irish coffee and good location at the end of the temple bar 
R0123,Do not eat here  It is very expensive  for what it is   the staff are incredibly unfriendly  The food is really beyond mediocre  Do not eat here 
R0123,"Every time I come here I get the pad thai  And every time after taking my first bite  I wish I hadnt  

Flavourless and unforgivably greasy  I feel sick every time  

Avoid if you can; this is my last time I swear  "
R0123,Excellent enjoyed the food tremendously  �The view of the canal was fantastic  �The staff most excellent in performance and conduct 
R0123,Food ok    The pizza was the best but service is poor 
R0123,Food was excellent but service wasnt what you would expect from such a top rated restaurant  We had a reservation for 9  left standing waiting at the door to be seated until 20 past 9  No aplogises given for delay  After being seating staff taking the orders very rude 
R0123,Food was good  Service needs work  Waitress took our order didnt write it down and then brought wrong dish   Sat there for 20 minutes waiting while my family had their dinners  Maybe we just caught them on a bad night 
R0123,"Food was superb and beautifully presented 
Service was pleasant and friendly 
Definitely will be returning in the near future "
R0123,Great food and great ambiance   After a walk in Dublin  its a pleasure to eat in this restaurant  
R0123,Great food  and a decent price  one of my favourite places to eat in Dublin
R0123,I came here for lunch and ordered their Tonkasu ramen  Didnt try other stuff  If you are a fan of tonkasu ramen  you will be disappointed 
R0123,I have no idea if this restaurant changed hands or chef recently  Food used to be amazing but I have visited twice recently and the food was extremely disappointing on both occasions 
R0123,"Poor service 
Burnt pizza "
R0123,"Portion size for money paid very small   We ordered Gnocchi which was literally smaller than an appetizer size  The chicken was so so 

And there could be no variations  All I asked was can you add more veggies to the penne  and was told no  
When I asked ""why not  you have the veggies  and you can charge me""  the server said  ""our chef doesnt want to mess up his signature dishes""  Lollll  I didnt tell her that a chef who isnt creatively flexible is no chef   

What I asked wasnt anything too difficult  We are vegetarians for religious reasons and I have never been to a restaurant where a vegetarian pasta with additional veggies wasnt made for me upon request 

Also  the waitress came to table once to take order and never returned  We and another patron began to go downstairs to request the check when she came up and asked  ""oh  you dont want anything else ""

The head server/greeter was snotty  as if giving us a table was not in his interest  When we first walked in  he said  ""were booked for at least 2 hours  if youd like to check back later""  Thats when we booked on online app and voila  we had a table within 30 minutes 

Too bad  cause the food was delicious   But I go to restaurants for the vxx entire dining experience and will rank higher those who offer good service and mediocre food than restaurants like this one that has great food  good ambience  but poor service "
R0123,Probably among the worst service Ive ever experienced  It was as if the staff had been beamed down to earth that morning from another planet and didnt have a clue what was going on  We really should just have asked for our money back and left  but of course our dining companion was hungry and he wanted food  thus we waited on those pancakes   for a long  long time  Five star food and one star service equals a three star rating overall   and Im probably being extremely generous here  please get your act together and train your staff properly  otherwise youll alienate a lot of customers if you dont   
R0123,Service was slow  Food was good but they messed up a meal and we received the wrong order  They did compensate us by giving us a complementary deserts  Would not hurry back though 
R0123,"Staff not the best utensils dirty plates cold very bad in dining area 
Food it self of average quality "
R0123,The service was very slow  While the food was good value  the wine was very expensive  One of our table was told that she could only order two glasses when she asked for a third  The food was mediocre some of the dishes were only lukewarm 
R0123,Very central a busy vibe early in the evening  Tasty food  Service was very rushed we really felt they wanted the table back that was our only flaw 
R0123,Very convenient location  friendly staff  Both food and service were excellent 
R0123,Very good food and atmosphere  For a person with a disability its very awkward to get to the bathroom  
R0123,We Booked a table for 9pm for 6 people ; the restaurant called a while later to say they couldnt accommodate us at that time  We agreed to delay the reservation until 9 30  with the staff member saying it would be ready by then  When we arrived  there was no table  The lady dealing with reservations was extremely busy setting up other tables  not for us   and just asked us to wait In the centre of the restaurant but didnt give a time frame on how long it would take  We eventually asked for any table in the short term and got a table  for 4 whilst waiting for the other table to be added  We had to find additional chairs ourselves  We eventually got seated at 10 to 10  which for us was way too late to eat  As a positive the service staff that actually dealt with us when ordering were absolutely lovely and the food was very tasty  I just wouldnt depend on the reservation times at all and there was also just an assumption that wed continue to wait as long as was necessary  To be fair  if wed known  we would simply have booked elsewhere  but at that hour our hands were tied  It seems to defeat the purpose of the app if the available slots are not actually available 
R0123,We were out for a meal for 2 on a special occasion  when we were seated and served our food a table for 4 to our left was turned and rearranged for seating for 6 people  This had a very bad impact on our whole experience  due to the fact we then had the backs of the people seated there  in very close proximity to us which impinged on our privacy  Also when the staff were serving this and other tables and people going to use the toilets we felt like we were eating in a corridor due to this table rearrangement  Our evening was cut short and spoiled as a result of this  When leaving we made our views know to the manager who seemed to be totally uninterested in our evenings experience 
R0123,Went there while visiting our daughter  Our daughters order was messed up and arrived 20 minutes later  The booth next to us was being used to film a commercial which completely disrupted our meal and the service  This shouldve been done after hours 
R0124,Very enjoyable night  Great food and good service considering it was valentines night
R0125,Food was terrible  Floors were dangerously greasy  Bathrooms were shabby 
R0125,Poor service  priority given to delivery orders  Food was cold and mushy when arrived  Overpriced 
R0125,The foot was very good but the service was extremely slow  We waited and waited and had to order bread to carry us over  Love the atmosphere but the service is way to slow to deal with 
R0126,"Comfortable seating but noisy when full due to the hard surfaces and high ceilings  Second time to eat here  The first time was much better as it was quiet empty so service and food was much better 
Last visit we waited 40 minutes for the starters and 80 minutes for the mains to come out from the order taken  Also left waiting for the cocktails to arrive  we actually finished our wine for the meal whilst waiting for the drinks to arrive 
Everyone in our group enjoyed the food but did say that they would not return due to the long waiting times "
R0126,Excellent food  prices have increased and service has decreased since my last visit 
R0126,Fantastic Restaurant  would highly recommend a visit if you havent yet 
R0126,Fire alarm was going off intermittently from when we sat down until we got the main course  Couldnt have a conversation  Really loud  Headache inducing  Main issue was that no one apologised or explained  we had to call our waitress over and ask what the issue with it was  We also paid full price for the meal and werent even offered a free drink by way of an apology  Food is not cheap either 
R0126,Firstly  the food here is good and we all enjoyed our meal   When we were ordering  we asked if we could make a side dish subsitution on one of the dishes  and the waitress spoke to a manager who confirmed this was fine   But when the bill arrived  we were charged  Euro 7 for two additional side dishes   We queried this and the staff member confirmed a mistake was made and a new bill was brought   It definitely left a bad taste in our mouths 
R0126,Food was dry  asked for more maple syrup and was told there was already some on my pancakes and didnt get any more
R0126,Food was lovely  But service was very slow   Only got two drinks as no one came near us   We also asked for the desert menu which wasnt brought   Drinks empty  We had to go look for someone to bring the bill to us
R0126,Gorgeous food    greeted and seated quickly    service was quick and friendly    food delicious as always    would highly recommend it
R0126,Great atmosphere  food was amazing    Will be back soon
R0126,Great service  Was given a booth as we had a buggy which was great they seen my special requests   Food was top notch as usual  Very friendly staff  Highly recommend this hidden gem of a restaurant 
R0126,"I prebooked a lunch time table for two for an anniversary  On arrival was greeted very rudely by lady completing a task on a hand held device   ""With you in a minute "" Hardly looking up   A waitress came to assist and was likewise snapped at as she had to be shown how to confirm the booking on an iPad  ""Put them over there"" was the instruction  Food was hot and service reasonably quick in a busy lunch time  Its a noisey place when busy but knew that going in  Overall a bit pricey at  Euro 55 for two mains  two teas  two desserts  My partner sent an email later to complain about the attitude and received a prompt reply at least  Disappointing "
R0126,"Ive been to restaurant a number of times  however  I was a little disappointed with experience on this occasion  The resturant was very cool we had to ask for tge ""heater"" beside us to be turned up  The food wasnt to its usual extremely tasty standard  The starter  soup was delicious but the mains selection was not great  The dessert was just ok "
R0126,It was better than the last time i was there as there was no vegetarian option on menu
R0126,Look at changing your breakfast tea  this very weak in taste and we have found on a number of occasions its not hot for long 
R0126,Lovely place for lunch very quick service and lovely staff    will return
R0126,Lovely visit with very pleasant staff and a delightful meal   What more could you want  
R0126,Main course was ok  not great  The dessert  which Was baked Alaska was bland and was rock hard  The restaurant was cold and lacked an atmosphere 
R0126,"Melting ball didnt melt 
Goats cheese with sourdough bread was not as expected the bread was miniture very thin strips rather than a slice
Apart from these issues everything else was amazing"
R0126,"My order was a small one as I was really just after a snack  so I got a side of crispy duck pancakes which come with Hoisin sauce and spring onions  I love duck pancakes  but these poor lads were a pretty poor attempt  Three tiny wraps that looked more like sad cold little papery fingers  containing bits of fatty duck  drowned in sauce  with one tiny limp piece of spring onion which one would assume was initially included for a bit of crunch   

I ate it  but only cos I was hoping to convince myself that it was going to be nice in the end  It wasnt "
R0126,Nice food and staff but service very slow  We would have liked dessert but were not offered a menu and we then ran out of time 
R0126,Nice meal with friends  Food good  Friendly staff  Decent value
R0126,Not impressed with our meal  Atmosphere was super cute but service and food were average at best  I had to explain how to charge us correctly to our server twice  Literally walk him through our food choice and how we were being overcharged 
R0126,Omg  The worst hamburger Ive ever had in my life  look at rhe picture of it and how small it is  how are you supposed to eat something like that  I asked for medium and it was well done and the top was burnt it was tough to cut and the bun was so stale  The only good thing about it were the polenta fries  they were great  My friend had the pasta with pork and you can see from the picture how unappetizing it looks and it was just extremely bland the pork had good flavor but that was the only thing good about it  neither one of us finished a quarter of either dish  it was so bad this place is god awful
R0126,"Right  updated review  
One of the worst dining experience of my life was had yesterday evening  Myself and a friend dropped in for an after work bite and a cheeky Tuesday vino  We were seated and then ignored for 15 minutes till I hollered at a waitress for a couple of glasses of water  20 minutes later and with no sign of anything to quench our thirst  never mind a chance to order  I signaled another staff member who was pitching for Irelands rudest waiter  It still took 10 more minutes for the water and wine to arrive and then a further 20 for the food  By this point we were both about to chew the leg off the table  so imagine my friends disappointment when her meal arrived  and was incorrect  which it proceeded to be the 2 more times we sent it back      The 3rd time it came it was almost right  so she figured this was probably the best that could be hoped for and chowed down on her baby sized portion  seriously  the burger was the size of a pog    Mine also was titchy tiny  but at least correct "
R0126,Second time at peach tree east  Much the same as the last time   Excellent food  service and ambiance  Cheers guys 10/10
R0126,service was very slow  seated at 5 32 got starters at 6 02  had to ask waitress to put through our mains when starters came as we were in a rush  didnt seem to make any difference  there were 3 waitresses and about 5 tables taken
R0126,Steak was done to perfection  love this place  Great value and service 
R0126,The food is amazing  always fresh and delicious but the service is poor  We had to wait for the main course over 45 minutes  considering some of us did not order starters it was a long time to wait 
R0126,"The food is nice  would not go out of my way for it  but if I was in the area I would give it a go again 

Only main criticism is the food was lacking seasoning "
R0126,The food was excellent   However  we all thought the waiter was a bit too pushy and in our faces   He insisted on pouring the wine which we would have preferred to do ourselves   Also the service at the end of the meal was very slow  even though we had specified that we had to leave to go to a show   We ended up not having time to finish either our dessert or our wine 
R0126,"The food was lovely and presented really well but the restaurant was so cold that we couldnt enjoy it  We had to sit with our coats on through our entire meal  We complained to the hostess and she told us it was because there were so many windows and they were having a problem with drafts  We decided to order some tea to try and warm ourselves up and we had to wait 20mins before it arrived and then they charged us  Euro 5 80 for the tea  They could of at least offered us complimentary tea given the cold conditions  

The food was lovely but Very bad service atmosphere and conditions meant we didnt enjoy it  Would not be returning"
R0126,The restaurant is so uncomfortably cold that you simply cannot enjoy the experience  When I go out to eat I dont expect to need to leave my coat on  Such a pity  because the food is very good
R0126,The worst brunch ever 
R0126,This was our fifth time to dine so I was very disappointed  to be given tough turkey in my salad when I asked for chicken salad which was the one on the menus   We are known to the staff and couldnt believe they would treat a customer this way of course it was change for me after 10  min too late as my husband was finnished his meal the butternut soup was very good
R0126,Top quality food  friendly service and great value for money 
R0126,Very impressed with our visit  much improved since my first time there but on that occasion it was not long opened I would definitely make a return visit
R0126,"Terrible service:

 1  Food served within minutes of ordering and main course arrived as soon as starter cleared

 2  Incorrect main course arrived

 3  Sommelier  who looked some way from being sufficiently well groomed to be in a food service environment  was inattentive except when he was shuffling about pushing past us to get to the window ledge he was using as a wine rack

 4  Within seconds of being served coffee/tea  we were still pouring it  the Maitre D asked us if  on promise of a free drink at the bar  would we mind leaving our table   we declined  he badgered us for much longer than was comfortable  he hectored couple behind us who also declined at first   they ended up wedged sharing a small table with others near the bar as they had their free drink

 5  Bill contains a drink we didnt order  they had noted and corrected on way to table 

 6  Waiter turns up with wrong coats

 7  Approach manager at end of evening to discuss all the above   his response  broad indifference and ""sorry  nothing I can do about it now is there "" No offer of restitution etc "
R0126,We always enjoy this place  The only thing where sitting at back there was a draught  People at end of table were cold  Everything else was enjoyable
R0126,We enjoyed a delicious lunch at the Peach Tree last Sunday  Friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere  I shall return    
R0126,We had a table book for 4 but 1 of our party couldnt make I told the girl on arively dat there was only 3 now she put us at a 2 seated table which was beside the piller and pushed a chair over and didnt even put a table setting on the table we order drinks wen the food arrived but did not receive them till over food was eaten 
R0126,Would not recommend at all  AVOID
R0127,Always a great spot to go to  Great food and service and very reasonable pricing
R0127,Delicious brunch and friendly service in a beautiful setting that is family friendly
R0127,Food lovely  service efficient  and  friendly  Not happy about being charged  Euro 1:50 for one slice of sliced pan bread 
R0127,Gorgeous little spot with tasty well prepared food and a lovely ambiance and great value  A really lovely dining experience 
R0127,Had lovely lunch here a few days ago  Good service   Food was very fresh and beautifully presented  Will go again

R0128,Food good service good noise level a bit high  felt a bit rushed with meal  otherwise enjoyable
R0128,Food was excellent and so was ambience but what really stood out was the superb staff 
R0128,Lovely room  a little empty at lunch time  staff good
R0128,Lunch for 2 was excellent  it was great to have a choice of 1  2 or 3 courses 
R0128,Really good food and great cocktails    Great vibe 
R0128,Service all very nice Pre theatre menu very tiny portions
R0128,"Very inventive cuisine
Lively atmosphere  and  interesting people watching 
Great service 

Highly recommended"
R0128,3rd time coming to here on weekend trips to Dublin  One of my favourite 
R0128,5 Star service  food was well portioned  exceptional quality and we felt very well looked after from start to finish
R0128,A great evening with excellent food and wine  Attentive but not intrusive staff 
R0128,"A last minute dinner plan and a desire to eat at an indian we hadnt tried before  left us landing at this doorway at 10pm one Saturday 
Looks pretty unprepossessing  but I didnt hold that against it  Not empty: a few tables  one lively youthful one was having fun 
The service was unenthusiastic  but not rude  there were none of the usual pappadams to whet your appetite  
The prices were middle of the range  say 12   15 for a main course  The options  straight down the line  no surprises  The wines seemed overpriced for a place like that; I think there was nothing under 25 and all sounded uninteresting 
But the worst thing was the food  gloopy  cornflour thickened sauce  with a smell of over the counter curry sauce  You can get as good or better from the chilled section of Tescos for 3 euros 
Couldnt get attention to pay our bill either  we debated doing a runner  but didnt  But what a waste of money 
Give it a miss"
R0128,A lovely experience   The food was divine  the service was exceptional
R0128,A most enjoyable evening     well worth the visit  And a repeat visit     
R0128,A rich and wonderful combination of excellent friendly service  good quality food and healthy portions  great ambience delivering a near perfect evening for us  couple looking for casual but special eating out experience   Have eaten a number of times before and each time I return the experience reminds me why I come back each time  Highly recommend 
R0128,A very nice suprise  the quality of the food was excellent and I will be definitely coming back   
R0128,Absolutely a brilliant night   great food  wine  and service  Highly recommend for any occasion    
R0128,Absolutely fantastic restaurant   Very friendly waiting staff   table was perfect  lovely atmosphere  everyone dining there appeared to be really enjoying themselves  Food was just amazing   perfectly cooked and my friends commented several times how many flavours the dishes had   Perfect place for a romantic night out or a get together   Will most certainly be back   highly recommend the cocktails too   Little glasses of heaven  
R0128,Always a pleasure to dine here

R0128,Beautiful meal  both the fish and vegetarian options were exquisite  We will definitely come back 
R0128,Booked this restaurant for a special occasion   Food and waiter service was excellent   However we were put under pressure to vacate our table before our allotted time   Our waiter was obviously uncomfortable with this   Ruined the whole evening   
R0128,Both the food and service was excellent  I would recommend this restaurant 
R0128,"Came here for brunch  We arrived before 12 on a Saturday  It was pretty empty and we managed to get a window table  The window tables are great for people watching  

The staff that served us were fine  They were polite but not as warm as they could be  The music was OK  It was easy to hear because the place seemed to lack a buzz  
There are far better places "
R0128,casual dining vibe aside  the music was way too loud for a dining room   service was decent to be fair but the beef was 75 percent grizzle  the broccoli tasted like smoke and the chips were cold   et walla  
R0128,Celebrated my brothers 65th birthday  fabulous night  food and service was amazing  Would highly recommend it  looking forward to my next visit

R0128,Easter Sunday lunch with hubby  Extremely good value of Euro 28 for three courses 
R0128,"Food = Ugh  this is annoying  I really wanted to enjoy this but nothing was very good  in fact  it was kind of bad if Im honest  Steak was rubbish  like rubber  Sides were huge but bland and over cooked  
Wouldnt recommend based on that visit "

R0128,Excellent dinner  Great choice of food and cozy atmosphere  Everyone was friendly

R0128,"Fantastic service 
Knowledgeable staff and the food was excellent "
R0128,Fantastic service  great cocktails  amazing food  Wonderful dining experience 
R0128,Felt very rushed  we were told we had the table for two hours but were asked to vacate after an hour and 20 mins
R0128,"Firstly  I will say that the service was recognised on the night to not be up to standard and we were offered dessert free of charge  This was a nice gesture but I feel it still needs to be mentioned  
We felt ignored when we first sat down to our table  there were 2 people beside us who arrived 5 10 minutes after and were served before us  It was almost impossible to order a bottle of wine and on the third attempt we managed to get a guys attention  However our main courses arrived and still no wine   no record of an order so we had to order again  Last but not least  my fiance received the wrong main course but at that point we were fed up trying to seek peoples attention  We had received a voucher for this place  from friends for our engagement and it really was a disappointing experience  We wont be back of our own accord and its not somewhere we would recommend either "
R0128,Food   especially the meat was Divine   Fantastic eve 
R0128,Food  and  Service was of a very high standard  Look forward to returning

R0128,Food is wonderful  venue central and staff are so professional  Just a great  fun place to eat 
R0128,Food was delicious and very well presented 
R0128,Food was delicious and very well presented but waiting staff wanted to hurry us along
R0128,Food was excellent   halibut was really good   and the Malbec is worth ordering
R0128,Food was excellent   presentation was good as was the flavour   Good selection 
R0128,Food was excellent and staff were very friendly and informative on the menu and drinks selection 
R0128,Food was excellent but the restaurant was very busy  the noise level was incredibly loud  and  made the experience extremely uncomfortable  We were in the area at the back by the window but we couldnt hear each other talking  Was looking forward to a nice leisurely lunch but couldnt wait to leave unfortunately 
R0128,Food was excellent  Services was great  Food saved the day though 
R0128,Food was fab  great service
R0128,Food was good  but overall very disappointing   Hectic and lack of soul for a Bib gourmand restaurant 
R0128,We spent over �300 for lunch for 4 people  I would expect far better at half that price 
R0128,"Food was ok but the service was terrible  Given a table that was really cramped  when we asked to move to one of the many free tables we were told they were all booked 
An hour later half the restaurant was still empty 
The waiter had no idea what the specials were so one of us got up to go read the board   We asked what he recommended and he just said it depends what you feel like "
R0128,"Food was very good 
Service was a bit flakey   20 minutes to get a drink   Staff busy looking cool   not focused on anticipating customers needs 
On returning from the toilet   I cant shouldered out of it by the waiter who didnt get me a drink earlier 
Hes obviously a "" very important person "" as a customer to him Im clearly not 
The music was headache inducing   boom boom  endless tuneless   not conducive to relaxation"
R0128,Food was very good  Service was good up until the end when the waiter made us wait close to 15minutes to pay by card while he chatted away at other tables  not actually serving  despite acknowledging we wanted to pay and saying he would be with us in a minute 
R0128,"Food was very poor for the cost 
Tables too close 
Had to ask 3 times for the bill"
R0128,Good food  knowledgable and pleasant staff will be back
R0128,Gorgeous meal  very helpful and accommodating staff

R0128,Great staff Italian and Romanian
R0128,Great welcome upon arrival and we got seated quickly  Unfortunately the service slowed significantly as the meal went on and we had to try and catch our busy waiters attention for more water  the bill etc  Two of us thought our meal was superb but one friend felt both her fish starter and main was very salty  Would go again but would have concerns about service 
R0128,Great venue  Great food  Lovely relaxed environment   Love it and cant wait to go again soon 
R0128,Had a lovely meal  The food was delicious and the service was great  We were not moved on from our table even though we stayed for almost 3 hours  I will be highly recommending to everyone and well definitely be back  Thanks to all of the staff for such an enjoyable evening 
R0128,Had a lovely pre theatre meal here  Astonishing standard and value for money 
R0128,Hadnt been in quite sometime and it was one of the finest meals I have had in Dublin this year  Highly recommend 
R0128,The food is good so it has potential but the place is just dirty looking and messy 
R0128,"I felt the service was poor; staff were pushy and unfriendly 
Portion sizes were ridiculously small  Wont be returning "
R0128,I genuinely cant recommend this place more  Went for a business meal  Incredible service  food was genuinely fantastic and everyone who came really enjoyed themselves and raves about how good the experience was  I highly recommend this place   Looking forward to my next meal there  Simply outstanding from both a food and service perspective  I will be back  
R0128,I had a guide dog  no disability awareness  Accident with wine not acknowledged  Food vegetable virtually non existent  Broccoli very tough  could not cut it  No water offered to my guide dog 
R0128,I have eaten twice in two weeks because this restaurant offers excellent service  delicious food  and a very comfortable yet stylish atmosphere   The menu has a variety of choices that should please everyone   on my first visit I had an very tasty pork loin preceded by an amazing foie gras parfait   One of my friends had the pea soup as her starter  and she said that it was far and away the best pea soup ever   I can also recommend the rocket salad as a side dish   Other main courses that we loved were the spring lamb  the suckling pig  and the John Stone strip loin   i highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who appreciates great food in a beautiful setting 
R0128,"Food was mediocre and expensive  I ordered fish  which was overcooked  The restaurant was extremely noisy and it was full  but the place was cozy

R0128,It came highly recommended by friends and did not disappoint  Sauce with the mussels was amazing  Entrees were all excellent  Did not have dessert  ate way too much bread  and  mussels sauce 
R0128,It has such a lovely atmosphere and is ideally located in the heart of the city  The staff is friendly and helpful and the food is to die for  Id highly recommend it to anyone 
R0128,"Its so sad  given that there really arent that many restaurants on oconnell street  This place  with a location like this  could actually be turned into a nice place to eat that would really be very busy  
Honestly  regardless of how hungry you are  go somewhere else  This was just awful "
R0128,"Just ordered from here  read some good reviews so was pretty excited  
What a let down  food arrived not completely cold but not hot  Taste was not good at all  We got taco fries  couldnt eat them  donar kabab was very dry with no sauce and flavor not great  Chicken burger was greasy with half a slice of tomato  
The best thing about the meal was the can of coke  It was binned and we are now making baked potato  
Order somewhere else"
R0128,Love this place  one of my favourite restaurants  Fantastic food and atmosphere 
R0128,Lovely seasoned  tasty food cooked to perfection  Early bird fantastic value  Lovely ambiance 
R0128,Lovely surroundings buy very disappointing quality of food and wine for a place with such a good name 
R0128,Lovely Sunday lunch first time food delicious and all fresh products our waiter was excellent a very nice guy will def pay another visit next time in Dublin
R0128,Lunch on Tuesday October 2nd  Best lamb chops I ever had 
R0128,Most comfortable dining chairs   I would advise that you should not ask customers over 65 to wait sitting on high stools at the bar 
R0128,My first visit to Dublin and wanted somewhere good to eat for my wedding anniversary and took advice from  online reviews which were very good  It lived up to my expectations  the food was excellent as was the venue  atmosphere and efficiency for such a busy restaurant  If I am being picky one of the waiters who served at the table wasnt very friendly but others who also served at our table made up for it  Highly recommended 
R0128,"My friends and I were traveling for a few weeks in Europe for holiday and our Uber Drvier from the Dublin airport recommended this place  The food was delicious the service was excellent and very friendly  The ambiance was lovely  The bar had a very adventurous menu of cocktails and we would have stayed longer  except we had visited one too many pubs before dinner   
Would highly recommend"
R0128,"Nice place and so central   I ordered the pre theatre option of Salmon with chickpea chorizo  Great dish but they didnt seem to integrated with each other and salmon was just placed on top   I would have liked some bread with the dish too as its perfect for mopping up that great sauce  I hate asking for bread in restaurants for this purpose 

They also completely ignored my birthday note in my booking message "
R0128,Nice location / staff and good food well presented
R0128,Nice restaurant  very nice atmosphere  staff very attentive and friendly  Meat and fish dishes went down a treat  vegetarian option not so exciting 
R0128,"Nope  Nope  Nope  Definitely never again    

Food 
Lacklustre  underwhelming and expensive 

If you order via a la Carte  youre getting mighty ripped off    Even by opting for their 4 course special for  Euro 18  its still not worth it  

Staff 
Disingenuous  unfriendly and sloppy  plus with a mandatory service charge they can be cause their taking a tip whether they serve you good or bad    Cheeky  Very cheeky  

Entertainment  
No background music in the dining room so you can blatantly overhear the next tables conversation very easily    But out of nowhere appears this guy with a guitar wanting to sing us a song  like WHAT  Is this happening in a Dublin city restaurant    Perhaps loved by tourists  I dunno but we instantly felt uncomfortable and politely declined his offer"
R0128,One of the best meals Ive had in dublin  Staff great
R0128,Our best meal in Ireland  Fantastic menu  excellent preparation   enjoyable in every way 
R0128,"Our first visit was 18 months ago and was outstanding  We had some close friends who flew over from England to join us for our evening having been sick of hearing us rave about the venue  We found the online booking service efficient and received both confirmation emails/texts confirming booking for 8 15pm  On arrival at 8 15pm the table was not ready so we approached the bar to order pre dinner drinks  When we asked the bar man could he recommend a cocktail etc he replied ""A pint of vodka with an ice cube each"" he was not interested at all so I intervened with the awkward pause and ordered two bottles of wine  We had to stand in the corridor which served as bar and waiting area and reception and two tables trying to eat so we were basically in a line having to dance around in circles to move from waitresses  customers etc   not a good start  Once seated the specials were explained and menu was fab   sad to see the pre dinner cocktails at the top of the menu that the barman had failed to recommend  We made our selections from the outstanding menu  The starters arrived beautifully presented but mine was wrong   to avoid embarrassment i kept quiet until one of our guests noticed his was wrong too    back to the kitchen they went  The bread was handed out to keep us going with a portion of butter the size of a two euro coin between the 4 of us   when I asked for more butter the waiter asked how much butter did I need   My husband went to the Maitre D and explained our disappointment and embarrassment   and the service escalted to expectations immediately Starters eventually replaced and were again delicious as were the mains  The food here really saved the day  Our bill was adjusted to reflect the hiccups we experienced but has left us feeling nervous about a return visit "
R0128,Our meal was absolutely amazing   would highly recommend dining here  
R0128,Outstanding cuisine with great company   Staff were friendly 
R0128,Outstanding food  drink  service  ambience and location 
R0128,Outstanding service and value 
R0128,Outstanding service  delicious food and excellent value 
R0128,Poor service  to start we were given wrong menu � not kid friendly   had our 6 year old with us and they have no childrens menu   Would not go back   Expensive for what you get    high prices   much nicer around the city for same money and less 
R0128,Really impressed by the quality of the food and the excellent service   Loved it 
R0128,Really lovely restaurant   Great food   Loved the pre theatre menu   Good value 
R0128,Really this is one of my favourite city restaurants  Food is both interesting and good 
R0128,service excellent  food very disappointing  Starter of beetroot and goats cheese no goatscheese   Main lamb very tough and raw carrot    Bad value 
R0128,"Service was good
Food was good
Very noisy 
Great location 
Nice bar"
R0128,Service was outstanding  Try the lamb   You wont regret it 
R0128,"Service was slowish but adequate 

The pork belly had quite a lot of cartilage which made it uncomfortably crunchy

Have had good meals here before  this wasnt one of them"
R0128,Simply Great
R0128,Smart trendy restaurant with open kitchen  always a good sign  Great ambience  Excellent menu and food with a great selection of  really good wines by the glass  Service and attention to detail was first class Would highly recommend it and I will be back 
R0128,"Sorry we had a very bad experience food was rushed out my wifes main course was cold fish 
broccoli was like a rock we complained to our waiter next minute another portion of broccoli arrived again like a rock did not take away the old one
They did not charge us for our Starters   "
R0128,Stunning menu choice and food did not disappoint  service was also spot on  highly recommend
R0128,Superb food and service  The core de bouef was top notch  Cant wait to go back 
R0128,Tables too close together and noise level almost unbearable  Food and service was great 
R0128,Tables too close together and noise level almost unbearable  Food and service was not so great 
R0128,The atmosphere is rather hectic  not what you would call relaxing 
R0128,We were asked to vacate the table just coming up to ten minutes before the two hour allotted slot and presented with the bill without asking for it  I know this is common practice but what an annoying thing that has become so common in restaurants 
R0128,The food  and  service is exceptional 
R0128,The food was excellent  service was perfect  a bit pricy but totally worth it
R0128,The food was good  However  it was served before e we could finish our aperitif 
R0128,The food was very tasty and the presentation in the plate was excellent 
R0128,The food  wine  ambience and service were spectacular 
R0128,"The menu presented was unlike menu on website  I wanted to go for the two course lunch menu  I had hoped to order the pig cheek ragu as seen on your website  It was not on the menu  This is misleading and wasting peoples time  As I dont eat fish and didnt fancy the risotto  the chicken was my only option  Frankly chicken with BBQ sauce  bubble and squeak and sweetcorn is not at all appetizing  
We skipped this place  and headed to the this place  where we ate very well "
R0128,The restaurant is fabulous and the food delicious  The staff are great too  I would highly recommend it for a special  occasion 
R0128,The staff were very welcoming and friendly and the food was gorgeous  All tasty and unhurried
R0128,The starter  and  dessert were lovely  The main course  Halibut was underseasoned and bland  The music was much too loud and not cosy restaurant appropriate at all  It was also cold  Really disappointing for a nice restaurant 
R0128,The steak was great  but the starters not as good  It was noisy in there og little bit overpriced 
R0128,They had a feckin photoshoot on while we were trying to have our meal  Camera flash going off every 30 seconds  Also had 20mins+ wait for the bill  Boo urns  Superb food though 
R0128,"They pushed the specials and when we ordered them they were out  

Service was hit and miss  The girl greeting us on arrival was great but our table waiter had attitude and was clearly angry about something    slapping our food on the wobbly table and huffing about between tables 

Extremely disappointed that they even open and serve this poor quality food on a slow nights  we were there on a Monday   They should protect their reputation by never deliberately staffing the kitchen with the B team on slow nights  

We definitely wont be back "
R0128,"We didnt expect much meat on the suckling pig and was surprised there was even less than expected  It also was the only warm thing on the plate  The vege was cold 

The halibut was bland and not hot  the vege was room temperature  Awful soggy oily cold baked vege and fish that didnt deserve to die and end up on a plate like that 

The sides  completely unnecessary but heavily pushed  were also cooked many hours earlier and were barely warm and soggy    inedible  

We got our bill   Euro 104  after several requests and left to have dessert elsewhere  "
R0128,This is one of our top places to go in Dublin and it never lets us down  Im always recommending it 
R0128,This restaurant never disappoints  Its always top of my list for celebrating an occasion 
R0128,This was my first time and I will absolutely be returning  There is a great atmosphere and I genuinely couldnt find fault with the food  We had a drink at the bar first  the barman was knowledgeable and very helpful  The cocktails were delicious and he walked us through the process as he was making them  All the waitstaff were friendly and helpful without being overbearing  The food was fresh and really tasty and there was  a good selection  Great experience and I would highly recommend 
R0128,Too crowded   Loud music
R0128,top class food   staff went above and beyond expectations   Nothing was a problem 
R0128,Totally amazing exeperience for 30th  Anniversary   Waiter fabulous owner the Chef  and a great restaurant manager   Food so amazing  Venison and Beef with a all the trimmings   Wine list to die for   Highly recommend this restaurant when in Dublin  Ireland  
R0128,Tried steak tartare for the first time and mind blown  Great food and service  Will be back soon 
R0128,Two course lunch menu was good value  Mussels starter was delicious but chicken main was a bit strange  I dont think the flavours complimented each other particularly well  Broccoli side was also good but bit disappointed that it wasnt tenderstem  Noise level was very very loud  which impacted the experience  Service level was ok  Felt a bit rushed through the courses 
R0128,Unfortunately the evening was  rushed  When I booked I was not told the table was required at 8 
R0128,Obviously the table was booked  after us and each course came very quick  There was 5 of us squashed onto a table for 4  Waitress informed us the table was required back but we could finish our drinks in the bar but then came back and said the bar was booked  It was very expensive and not enjoyable as I felt we could not relax 
R0128,Very disappointed   Bar staff more interested in having a good time and being �cool behind the bar   rather than engaging with the customer who is clearly an inconvenience to be �dealt with � until they are moved to the table    We were seated at bar while waiting for a table and barman not particularly interested   Too busy cleaning glasses and tossing empty bottles in the bin   the racket was extraordinary   that I actually thought we were too late and bar no longer serving   I asked him were they closing and he looked at me like I was mad   Then asked for a peroni beer    listed as being in tap   and curtly told there was none   His attitude didnt invite question   I waited until another bar tender appeared and asked him   He apologized and said yes that Peronis was listed as draft but had been changed to an alternative now available   Easy     and courteous answer   I have to say this set the tone badly for the rest of the evening   We would have left at that stage but table became available   Just ordered a mains then   Have to say the dining experience was totally rescued by our wonderful waitress Julie   Just outstanding   Absolutely worth her weight in gold   Food was lovely   House red wine   primitive   was good    Unfortunately   we wont be back and the sad reality is that this restaurant   and certainly the staff with the exception of our Julie   will be neither interested nor bothered  
R0128,"Very nice staff  atmosphere and food
Is great"
R0128,Very pleasant experience and food excellent indeed
R0128,Very poor experience   I expected much more from this place
R0128,"very welcoming 
friendly  and  courteous
food excellent
very enjoyable lunch

will return"
R0128,Waiter was a bit rude when we arrived and just wanted dessert
R0128,We arrived and felt as though our booking had been forgotten  We had to wait for our table and were sat between two very large  loud groups of people  
R0128,The food was lovely but the ambience was awful  Im sure that this was a departure from the restaurants usual high standards but we were so disappointed 
R0128,We dined on the pre theatre menu  which was fantastic value and had a great choice too  Would highly recommend 
R0128,We had an amazing meal with incredible service on our last night visiting Ireland   We highly recommend this 
R0128,We had an excellent meal  with great service  Would definitely go back
R0128,We had been here before and really enjoyed it however our most recent experience was very different  I had the same dish as what I had ordered before and in comparison was small and tasteless  My partner had the beef which he described as lacking flavour  Disappointing as we ordered the same dishes as the last time which were incredible before  Assume there has been a change of chef
R0128,"We had dinner in this place  the previous weekend and found it excellent so I felt very sure about booking it for lunch yesterday as we were hosting an American friend    But  while the service was very good we were all disappointed with the main course   especially  The guinea fowl was overpowered by the almost indigestable barley and my husband was not impressed  with the organic salmon and felt it was overcooked      Soup and terrine were very good but I felt the sauce was too sharp with the mussels  Ils Flottante was excellent   While we chose the cheapest white wine  we expect a reasonable taste but this fell far short   
I was particularly disappointed because I had insisted on going to this place  with my previous experiences   the other times had been for dinner but I did not expect such a deviation on standard for lunch  "
R0128,We went there twice   once at the beginning of the trip and then on the way back out of Dublin  Highly recommend it 
R0128,We were a company of three   Two of us had perfectly adequate food  but the third got burned gnocchis and burned cauliflower   I dont think its possible that the kitchen didnt notice   She did not want to make a fuss  but it totally ruined what would have been a nice meal 
R0128,We went for a company lunch  Needless to say the staff messed up our orders and we had to wait another 45 mins  Very unprofessional 
R0128,Unfriendly manager  Good food  Okayish service 
R0128,"We were a party of six celebrating 2 birthdays  We couldnt fault the food it was delicious    The service was not good I am sorry to say  the manager was unfriendly and didnt look like he wanted to be there and as for the waiter he was was just rude and in some ways we felt he was looking down on us to the point of we stopped talking/laughing when he approached the table  He may not have liked s a group but I think it is unprofessional for anyone in the service industry to behave that way All customer should be treated the same 

I would love to go back but the service needs improving  and a little more friendly "
R0128,"We were extremely disappointed  To start  the techno music  if you can call it that  was so loud we could not hear ourselves speak  If we wanted a noisy bar scene we would have picked a pub  
The one duck dish was so tough  barely able to be cut with a knive  The waiter  never did come to see what was wrong  The dish  sat untouched  Eventually the manager came and asked about the meal  and if anyone had approached us about it   No 
We didnt see the waiter until after the manager brought the bill 
In fairness  the manager did remove the item from the bill  but  the evening great dining experience we had anticipated was a total fail "
R0128,"We were so thrilled to get last minute reservations for our last night in Ireland here  8:45 pm     and were seated with no issue next to an open table set for a party of ten or so  My first mistake of the night was not requesting to be moved 

Once the large party arrived  they were basically screaming across the table to one another  making it impossible to speak to or even hear my fiance sitting directly across from me  It only got worse as the night went on  and in the bathrooms I heard other guests complaining of headaches from all the noise 

Our starters were nice enough  but our second mistake came with our choice of entrees  We had the ribeye and the venison  both which came out grey  way overcooked  and vastly underseasoned  Shame on us for ordering meat at a self proclaimed steak house  right 

�100 later and were off to get fish and chips from around the corner  What a farce "
R0128,Wonderful night  The food  ambience and service was excellent  Our server Colm was very attentive  friendly but unobtrusive  Most enjoyable and would highly recommend the whole experience  A great night
R0129,Excellent ambience
R0129,Amazing food  great wine and outstanding service  Would highly recommend 
R0129,An intimate very French treat in Temple Bar 
R0129,As usual  very good quality of food and good advice for wine
R0129,Cosy with great food and great choice of wine  Pastas are delicious and staff very helpful and friendly  Good for small groups
R0129,Dropped in here after seeing reviews on web  The breakfast was excellent and staff were very friendly  I will definitely be back 
R0129,Food absolutely gorgeous and staff extremely friendly and professional 
R0129,Food was excellent as was the wine  pleasantly surprised
R0129,Food  atmosphere and service all get full marks  thank you  Will definitely try and make it back here soon 
R0129,"Good food and  friendly service 

Picked a random wine from their �Weird Wine� section    it was great 

Highly recommended "
R0129,Great atmosphere  very good food quality  out of the touristic classic rounds  Strongly recommended  
R0129,Great food especially the chefs special and good service 
R0129,Great food  great service  Will be recommending
R0129,Great service  great pizza and a great ambience  �Just an all round gem  �Highly recommend 
R0129,I spent a week and a half going through top  recommendations before coming here  The food is the best 
R0129,"Absolutely vile  And the �this place is not at all clean  �It doesnt seem so at first but then looking around it is evident how dirty it is  �Im honestly  It sure how it stays open  

Avoid this place  "
R0129,"it was the type of place that youre groovy you went at least once toga e a drink with friends with some bites  but not the one that will become you HQ because its quite expensive for what it offers overall  3 Euro  for one single tapas is too exagerate  it is not like you had cabiaryon it  
To summarize it was nice but I wont go back instinctively"
R0129,It was very hot upstairs on Saturday last   Food was good but croquettes a bit disappointing  Wine list good
R0129,Mistake on the bill and 36 eur for a bottle of procecco   very disappointed 
R0129,"Our meal here last year during a stay in Dublin was the highlight of our trip  so we were very much looking forward to revisiting  Unfortunately  during our second visit   we received the worst service we have ever experienced  from our male server  He was rude  service was slow  and he even asked whether we would like to add a tip to our card payment  This is the first time in our lives that my husband and I have not given a tip  
The food  however  was delicious and we can not fault it in any way "
R0129,"Outstanding as usual  
I totally forgot to leave tips  Ill tip double next time Im in   "
R0129,Really lovely staff  the food and wine are delicious  and the prices are reasonable
R0129,Such a fun place  We love a decent wine list and theirs was very good  Claire was a delight  let us sample a few wines to order just what we like  She recommended dishes and everything was so delicious  Octopus  deviled eggs  pasta w pork  and the prawns were divine  Plus they played great music  Its cozy and charming  Highly recommend 
R0129,The best in Dublin  staff so nice and knowledgeable
R0129,"The food here was fairly good  and the wine was excellent  However  the service was genuinely very disappointing  We were booked for 5pm  so we were really and it wasnt busy  We were seated upstairs and had to wait over 10 minutes after they seated us before we got a menu  then a further wait to get drinks  

The gluten free options werent great as most things were served on bread  but they had no gf alternative 

After asking for the dessert menu  we had a further wait of nearly 15 minutes  after which we decided to just pay and leave without dessert  Another table of guests upstairs had to go downstairs to order their own drinks  and they were having the same conversations about poor service as we were  They didnt seem to realise or care theyd forgotten about us  If the service has been better we would have had more wine and 2 desserts  so it is their loss "
R0129,The place is simple and clean  There is not a ton of seating  but I do appreciate the outlets  Not a lot of food other than sweets 
R0129,This was a lovely refuge on a stormy night last Friday  Music was beautiful as well  Thank you  C
R0129,This was recommended by the Irish Times and was disappointing  The food was mediocre  service slow and inattentive and the place itself is in a sore need of a makeover  Definitely not coming back  would not advise others to visit 
R0129,Very disappointing food not sure how it was in the top 100 food review on the Indo  wine was very nice bit overall food was poor
R0129,"very disappointing that they have not made adequate provision for wheelchair users in this restaurant   But managed to get a table for two installed downstairs 
Disappointing food  It was okay  but no more   A nice place to sit outside during the summer  maybe   and have some of the pinchos  With wine   The main courses are very bland "
R0129,Very nice staff  fresh products  awesome pancakes with maple syrup  We had a pleasant family time on Sunday morning 
R0129,We really enjoyed our visit  Food was excellent and service very attentive
R0129,Went here on recommendation of a Dublin chef  Short menu but everything was excellent  No problem recommending it  We will certainly be back 
R0130, Another one of my pleasant experience during lunch at this place  Wild Irish game and pork terrine for starters was arguably one of the best starters i have had  Moving on to the pigs belly for main course  it was an amazing dish; something different to ordering a steak like i normally do but i was happy that i chose different  Not too heavy on the pocket  the restaurant offers a nice view onto the grounds of trinity college and i would recommend the place to anyone looking for a tasty lunch break 
R0130,Absolutely delicious   Service was great  Food was great  Atmosphere was great  Would have eaten more but what I had was so damn filling  
R0130,Five star food and wine and a five star experience  Unbelievable staff prompt service excellent presentation  A definite repeatable experience 
R0130,Food was flavourless and bland  Forgettable  and will not be back 
R0130,Gorgeous Italian food with excellent staff  and  atmosphere   
R0130,Great bar  and ambience  They dont have Guinness but they have a good selection of beer on tap 
R0130,Great beer  Loved the ambience  
R0130,Great restaurant  lovley Food   ambient was nice  
R0130,Had a lunch there at the start of December and found the food to be very good  The presentation of the food was excellent and the atmosphere was nice 
R0130,"I love this place  I discovered it whilst studying in nearby st  �It definitely falls into the ""cheap and cheerful"" category of eatery  but please dont let that put you off  �What I mean by that is that the food is relatively cheap  but it will definitely make you cheerful  �The portions are deceptively generous and extremely flavoursome  �My personal favourite is the Pad Thai  but I could also recommend the satay dishes  �As another reviewer correctly observed  this is probably not the best place to go for a first date  as the general appearance of the restaurant is closer to greasy spoon than it is to four star splendour  However  I would defy any foodie to set any prejudices aside and just enjoy the taste sensations and friendly staff  you will come away a happy camper  �At the sort of prices charged here  if youre in the area and hungry  its a no brainer  Enjoy  "
R0130,"I Went for dinner with friends and we definitely loved it the food and customer service 
Everything was marvelous "
R0130,I find these remarks and conversation very rude and unprofessional  It clearly seems they are either unhappy with their work or with services which has nothing to do with me 
R0130,Loved this place  Great food  solid coffee  friendly staff and a really enjoyable environment  Fantastic 
R0130,Lovely spot  great service
R0130,"My friends wanted to check out the Temple Bar  but I think we went to the wrong one LOL  A lot of pubs in Dublin seem to have Temple Bar in their name  so it was a bit confusing 

We came here before dinner time  so the bar was kind of empty  I cant believe how big it is though  Its three stories and live entertainment begins after 5pm  I could here some Irish music playing around that time  but when I went downstairs to look for the restroom  it looked like regular customers were just playing their instruments and singing along  which was still pretty cool 

For food  we shared the mussels  sweet potato fries  prawns  and seafood chowder  I also tried their strawberry beer and it was actually pretty good  The sweet potato fries were soggy  so I didnt enjoy that very much  The mussels were so good that we ordered another one  The prawns were more like shrimp  but had a nice sauce to accompany it  The seafood chowder had an adequate amount of seafood  so nothing to complain about 

Since we sat upstairs  we had a nice pretty nice view of the area  There were a lot of beers from around the world in glass cases behind our table for decor  When it got busy  it was hard to locate our server  but she did come to check up on us once in a while "
R0130,Place was clean  guy was nice  student special was a great deal  food was hot  extra condiments to put on  Relatively fresh  You get what you pay for  Great alternate to other fast food 
R0130,The staff are so nice  They made a fuss of our birthday boy  He was chuffed 
R0130,Their pricing is very modest  and the portions are still well sized �
R0130,This is a lovely  personal restaurant  I booked because I was looking for good food  reasonably priced with a nice  non intrusive  non loud music  relaxed ambiance  It was the 34th anniversary of my fathers death   an important date  We were not dissapointed  It is staffed with pleasant    authentic and attentive staff  easily located under the Luas tram station in Ranelagh  The overhead trams are irrelevant in the ambiance of this unique restaurant  As it is a small restaurant I  encouraged booking The app is excellent   There is on street parking but I recommend public transport so you can enjoy some wine  Excellent food  reasonably priced  Highly recommended 
R0130,Wonderful authentic Italian food  great service from the staff and no service charge on group bookings 
R0131,Always a great service and better food  Totally recommend this place if you like proper Italian food
R0131,Amazing pizza  great atmosphere  the vegan options were really good  Prices are really reasonable also
R0131,Amazing staff  food and ambiance  I loved every bit of it  We had a great time  We ate here as a group pre theatre and it was lovely 
R0131,Best dinner experience in Ireland  �The food was fabulous and flavors  unexpected  The wait staff were extremely friendly and helpful  Ambience  beautiful and comfortable 
R0131,Best pizza in Dublin 
R0131,Came here for a quick drink  Lots of selections on tap and the waitstaff were all so kind and hospitable 
R0131,Excellent food and wine  and very friendly staff  Would definitely recommend 
R0131,Great food and service will definitely go back when in Dublin again
R0131,Have visited 4 5 times  absolutely perfect but avoid the Christmas period where standards seriously slide  Perfect Michealan standards otherwise  chief often comes out and the sommelier is always spot on 
R0131,Loved this restaurant  it looks like a really authentic Italian which is cosy and romantic  the food was amazing  I wouldnt have gone for a pudding but based on how good the main was I knew the tiramisu would be homemade and deliscious and it did not disappoint  The staff were great and friendly and made it a lovely experience I would highly recommend to anyone visiting Dublin
R0131,"tasty food and warm welcome
great location
rather noisy"
R0131,"This place is highly recommended for anyone visiting Dublin  I went to dine at this place and I had an amazing time  Its located up in the mountain in a picturesque pub 
Friendly service  diverse menu  decent beer especially Guinness "
R0131,Very nice staff  really enjoyed the truffle ravioli 
R0131,We came for dinner in this restaurant on our last night in Ireland with a large group  excited to find somewhere that could accommodate all 10 of us  When we arrived  it took a while to track down our 7:45 reservation  Finally  we were showed to our table  It wasnt until 15 minutes later that someone came to take our drink order  Drinks were finally delivered and we ordered our food  2 appetizers  bruschetta and mozzarella caprese  neither of which required cooking   and 10 entrees  all of which were pasta dishes or pizzas  We waited a half an hour after ordering for our simple appetizers to arrive  Once they were finished  nobody came to clear the plates  or ask if we needed drink refills  We waited  and waited  and waited    and waited for our entrees to come  Finally  around 9:15  1 5 hours after arriving   I asked for an update on the status of our food  and was told that since we ordered appetizers  our food was going to take longer  Our party included 3 kids and 1 infant  who was starting to get fussy by this time  Our food was not delivered until 9:45 PM  2 hours after we had arrived  I was told time and time again  with very little actual empathy  that we ordered appetizers  and that there were several large tables that night  and thats why our food was so late  Im sorry  but if you cant accommodate large quantities of people  dont offer reservations for them  And appetizers or not  there is NO excuse for food to not be ready for 2 hours from the time of arrival at the restaurant  especially when every item we ordered was a very simple dish  Thankfully  the food was quite good  but we were all so frustrated and ready to leave by the time it arrived that we hardly enjoyed it  Skip this restaurant and take your business elsewhere 
R0132,Food was underwhelming and somewhat disappointing  Ordered calamari as a starter  It was fine but nothing special  Mains were a major disappointment  My daughter ordered a burger and it came as a meat patty baked in pizza dough  Menu stated burger came on their home made garlic bread  Well  apparently their home made garlic bread is their pizza dough covered in garlic spread  Extremely odd  I ordered a goat cheese salad which was essentially a salad made of toppings they use for the pizza and was hardly worth eating  My husband ordered pizza  It was okay  but not worth actually going here for it  Service was good and ambiance okay  Pretty empty for a Saturday night  After eating there I knew why  This place seems to cut corners in the kitchen to save money instead of making food that looks and tastes good 
R0132,"
They got nothing right and still charged me for everything"
R0133,"5th time dining here  great food as always  Service was quick a very courteous  
Ill be back next week "
R0133,Amazing Ramens and tasty sushis  lovely staff  cosy atmosphere  New favourite more than welcome in the vibrant neighbourhood 
R0133,Amazing sushi  one of the best around  Ill be going back soon  and have already recommended it to friends and family
R0133,Great little restaurant  fab ramens  especially spicy beef rib  Been there twice in a week  Yum 
R0133,"Ok  so I m serious about my ramen  I dont just say it because i ve watched the ramen girl and have suddenly decided to be an expert  I mean I tasted ramen in every major city I ever went  On my opinion  there are 3 things you should judge ramen by: 1  broth 2  eggs 3  pork  I m gonna concentrate on the eggs  cause u can judge the pork and broth on your own  and there is nothing worse than having over cooked chashu pork   � The proper serving of an egg is crucial  as I ve had boiled  fermented  and everything in between served w my ramen  If you get a hard boiled white egg in your ramen you should walk away shaking your head in disappointment  When cooked properly an egg should have absorbed the soy colour and marinade taste  Accomplished by 24 48 hrs of prior marination   The yolk should still be runny  but not under done  Every time I was served improper eggs  I presumed laziness or lack of knowledge  and in neither of these situations  you should be cooking ramen  if you fail to nail down the basics of cooking eggs 

Now since this is Dublin  Ireland I decided to go for tonkotsu butter misu  and let me tell you  it did not disappoint  The eggs were cooked properly  chashu pork was juicy and full of flavour  the noodles   fresh  and the broth  oh the broth tasted like Irish butter     Absolutely fantastic  props to the chef "
R0133,"Really bad experience  Average service  Great live music  

Would not recommend  Not if you need a quick meal "
R0133,"The staff were lovely and very attentive   Unfortunately the food let the entire experience down   

The ramen was greasy  and lacking in flavour   The goyoza spat out a greasy soy substance when I bit into it   The chilli mayonnaise served with the  chicken barely had a gentle hum of spice   

I was full of hope as a local but to be honest it will take a lot to get me to return  Its overpriced and under tasty "
R0133,"This was our 2nd visit as the 1st visit was great and really wanted to go back a second time to try a ramen dish which looked so good  unfortunately was such a let down  Of all the dishes that need to be hot its this one and it was cold    My bad for not getting it replaced at the time but the people next to us had cold ramen too and they were waiting ages for their replacements and we just didnt have time as we needed to be somewhere 

So I mentioned it to the waitress at the end as an FYI  she apologised but that was it  Would have been a nice gesture to discount something like the one beer we had or offer coffee   I Live locally so was planning on this becoming my regular haunt but regretfully that will not be the case now   "
R0134,Absolutely delicious food; generous portions for fair prices  incredibly well prepared 
R0134,Amazing food with very efficient and friendly service   Lovely restaurant would go back in a heartbeat 
R0134,Came from belfast for a girly day and had the most amazing wine and dinner  The staff are soo attentive and the food is just outstanding

R0134,Lovely food and great flavour   gourmet dining with flavours that Make sense
R0134,Really enjoyed the food and the staff were excellent  Local is great  Cant fault it would definitely recommend it  Great atmosphere and not overpriced 
R0134,This is a hidden gem  beautiful food in an elegant room
R0134,Unfortunately was a poor experience  Made to feel like second class citizens as using a groupon voucher  Customer service poor  Spoilt a family evening
R0134,Wonderful meal and a good escape from typical �Irish� menus that seem to repeat all over Dublin 
R0134,Wonderful pretheatre dinner experience  Delicious food  beautifully presented and the service was perfect 
R0135,Beautiful venue to bring beautiful company
R0135,Excellent food and service  Worth a visit

R0135,One word Disasterous
R0135,All round perfect visit  highly recommend to all  The food was delicious and great atmosphere  Wish we returned for the second night of our trip too xo
R0135,"All style no substance  
Nice looking restaurant with good atmosphere  Average food and service "
R0135,all was well  gorgeous venue and nice food and drinks
R0135,Amazing experience  great food and service was very good

R0135,Amazing food  cant wait to go back  Service is friendly and excellent 
R0135,Amazing food  nice atmosphere/ambiance and great service 
R0135,Amazing staff great food super service in all always a great experience
R0135,Beautiful Food  Outstanding Service  Great wine and cocktails  Lovely venue 
R0135,Beautiful venue but just not sure if Ill be back   The Mai Tais were the highlight and staff were lovely   My shrimp linguine was disappointing 
R0135,Being in the mood for pizza  decided to go to this place  I regret it  All those calories for such horrible pizza  Why oh why didnt I take it back and ask for the money back or just throw it in the bin and eat the salad I should have had in the first place  It was tasteless  dry and the crust had a strange texture or something  Not pleasing at all  
R0135,Being seated in the worst table at the kitchen door was not a good start   I noticed many empty tables that were never filled so putting us there made no sense   Pizzas were adaequate and Parmesan fries looked nicer than they tasted as they were very dry  Its  a nice space and perhaps a table on the Liffey side would have been nicer   Disappointing as its close to where I live and Id hoped to be a regular  
R0135,Big  loud  lively  welcoming  great bar  friendly service and sadly terrible food   I had concerns that an italian restauant in Dublin just wouldnt source real high quality italian ingrediant and my concerns were proven true 
R0135,Booked for a family lunch  Not told at booking stage that a limited brunch menu applied  Very good ambience but place is let down by the food which was very poor 
R0135,Booking from 6 8 and were asked to give back the table at 7:40  Particularly annoying given the fact that the restaurant was half empty 
R0135,Booled for my wifes birthday for the 2 of us  Food was ok but nothing special  and service was slow  Probably would not return for a date night  However the place was buzzing and would consider going back with a large group for a night out 
R0135,"Brilliant atmosphere and great location 
Food was fab and good value for money"
R0135,Brilliant service  really lovely spot  Very contemporary interiors and delicious food 
R0135,Brunch is good  but the desserts need some work 
R0135,Can you call it burgers  For us absolutely NO  I am sorry but we like big and taste patty beef burgers  They bring you a big sandwiches full of everything  you fa see from the pictures  but very is the most important part  The meat 
R0135,Cracking place  will be back quote a lot  we need more of these restaurants in Dublin 
R0135,Cracking spot for brunch  Food and drinks all on point  Definitely worth checking out 
R0135,Dinner for two with one drink each and one shared dessert was about 90 Euro   Inattentive staff  Mediocre food  Very cool vibe  but very loud 
R0135,Disappointed with service and standard of food  Such a pity  as the venue is great 
R0135,Worst dining experience of my life
R0135,Everything was good except I found it hard to get waiters attention at times 
R0135,Everything was really lovely 
R0135,Excellent cocktails and food  The service was great and I would highly recommend it 
R0135,Excellent service and food  My husband and I really enjoyed our date at this restaurants
R0135,Excellent service and the food was of top quality 
R0135,Excellent would highly recommend thank you         
R0135,Excellent  loved it all and cant wait to return 
R0135,Excellent  really enjoyed myself and the food was amazing and reasonably priced  Have to say the best Pork Chop I have ever had  Service was perfect and staff were very friendly  Would highly recommend it and will definitely be back 
R0135,Fabulous venue but unfortunately the really mediocre food lets it down  Its a real shame 
R0135,Fab venue  Delicious food
R0135,Family home from abroad ate here really good food and experience
R0135,"Fantastic food in a great atmosphere 
I always go here for brunch with the girlfriend "
R0135,First they wouldnt put an egg on the pizza  Chef does not accommodate changes  The ravioli was pea and asparagus  Not a great combination and not tasty at all  The pizza came after an hour waiting and the cheese was hard as if it had been there for a while waiting to be collected by waiters 
R0135,I only ate 3 slices and the waiter didnt even enquire as to whether everything was ok with it  Very poor experience  We will not be back again 
R0135,First time in here   Very enjoyable   Lovely staff delicious food  Will definitely be back
R0135,First time visiting for brunch after hearing great things from friends  Big fan  Will definitely be back again soon 
R0135,Food okay but atmosphere was great 
R0135,"Food presentation was unexpectedly bland and difficult to eat from the basket  Processed cheese was very dry and the dish was tasteless 
Well go back with friend but will scrutinize the menu first "
R0135,Food was average
R0135,Food was average unfortunately our hot food and drink didnt last long as the area we were seated in was absolutely freezing 
R0135,Food was really good but let down by the service  On arrival we were told 4 times that the table was needed back by 8 30pm before we had ordered anything  Service staff seemed really stressed and at times aggressive in approach 
R0135,Food was so over seasoned with salt it was nearly inedible
R0135,"Food was very poor  
Three of our group had salmon and all very disappointed  The taste of sauce/dressing was most unpleasant One other had pasta with cauliflower and equally as bad with no taste 
Will not recommend nor return "
R0135,"Good atmosphere 
Food was mediocre 
Waiting staff pleasant but some had poor English 
Would recommend to pop in for a drink"
R0135,Good food   service is lacking  We paid in cash and the waiter and/or front of house assumed we were giving a 25 percent tip; never returning our change  Seems they were understaffed as once our food arrived there was no further check up from floor staff on our table until we had to call them for more water 
R0135,Good service  bland food  Definitely would not go back 
R0135,Gorgeous place  food was amazing and a lovely treat   Staff were very attentive also
R0135,Great atmosphere  the food was amazing  Well definitely be back 
R0135,Great atmosphere fab surroundings  Food yummy   Highly recommended 
R0135,Great cocktails and creative preparations of food 
R0135,Great evening for a Monday food and wine were good and staff very attentive
R0135,Great experience overall would definitely go back 
R0135,Great food and amazing environment  The place has a different decoration  really gorgeous 
R0135,"Great food and service
Good vegetarian options 
Really nice vibe"
R0135,Great food  great cocktails  a bit expensive but nice for a special occasion
R0135,Great food  
R0135,Great food 
R0135,Great food  Exceptional friendly service  Would have liked to see a better range of non alcoholic beers  Upsells on mains should be promoted more 
R0135,Great menu    amazing building and decor    but food was barely lukewarm when served and service VERY VERY poor and it was a Wednesday evening and not very busy    When we had to ask for the bill a second time the waiter barked his reply   it was actually quiet embarrassing as I had friends visiting from out of town  Will return for drinks perhaps but definitely not for the dining experience 
R0135,Great service and buzzy atmosphere but main courses were pretty much inedible  Its a cool place with great potential but unfortunately  we wont be back 
R0135,Great setting  nice food but the waiters could do with some customer service training  Less than 90mins into a 2hr sitting and we were told we couldnt order dessert as they needed the table back in 10mins  Not a great end to an otherwise nice night 
R0135,Great spot  Would highly recommend thus restaurant   A hidden gem
R0135,Great venue  service and food   Will definitely be back 
R0135,Had a fab lunch in here  Staff were excellent as well as food and atmosphere 
R0135,So disappointing when dining for a special occasion  Save your money and time and go elsewhere
R0135,Had specified 2 months in advance it was a special birthday occasion  Was shown to tiny side room with no other diners while a massive hen party was placed in their main room  Was given no attention by server  After mains was asked 15 minutes after we asked for the bill if we wanted desert  So disappointing when dining for a special occasion  Save your money and time and go elsewhere
R0135,"Hi  We brought our friends here Sat night 

 This is my second visit 
The first visit was v good as our waiter was exceptional  Our food was cold that night but the waiter dealt with it all v well  

The second visit  on Sat night  our waiter was Not friendly and a bit abrupt  I spoke to the manager on duty who helped with the situation  Our veg were cold  The soup only warm  To be honest the venue is fabulous  But both visits  cold food and the waiters Manner just finished it off  

V disappointing  "
R0135,Horrible service  Horrible music  Who plays Justin Bieber and Hispanic music the whole time while in Ireland  Two of us payed  Euro 10 cover charge each for NOTHING  We went up to the bar with hundreds of people surrounding it because they only had two bar tenders staffed  After standing at the bar for literally 45 minutes without being served  we decided to leave  �DO NOT GO HERE  All the annoying / basic Americans go here   I am Born / Bred in Texas  I have the right to say that 
R0135,Host was a little snooty on the evening  Not a plesant experience 
R0135,Host was a little snooty on the evening when I asked could we move table 
R0135,Huge restaurant  full so great atmosphere  Would be great for large group parties  Highly recommend the tiger prawn linguine  was really tasty service was really good
R0135,I am a coeliac and it was hard to get anything but a salad for brunch  very disappointing food  I would just go here for the drinks and ambiance
R0135,I am disappointed that we are not taken into account my reservation message   I had asked for a candle on the dessert and I did not have one   I had said that it was a birthday 
R0135,I booked this for the veggie menu on the website but we were told by the waiter they were no longer doing it  Pizza or salad were the only veggie options  Cauliflower side was burnt   Bar staff were very slow to serve  Has so much potential as despite the above issues we enjoyed our visit 
R0135,I couldnt eat any cereals and it was really difficult to find something to eat  I had to have one of the starters 
R0135,I didnt like the service  My friend was allergic and we ordered a dessert  normal cheese cake   We didnt realize this dessert had fruit  which my friend is allergic to   The waiter didnt want to change the dessert since she wanted I eat the dessert because I was no allergic  
R0135,Everything is expensive for the quality of the food  The speical pizza is awful  it is not a normal pizza  because the middle of the pizza es empty and it includes lettuce instead  
R0135,"I had a dinner in the place    the food served was very poor  poor  quality of some of the starters and small portions   main dish lamb was like a chewing gum    overall a bad experience and a  pricey one  >100 euro without dessert or bottle of wine just 2 cups 

The place itself very noisy and not suitable for evening dinner but more for pizza and cocktails in a vibrant environment      bottom line i can not recommend the place for a dinner maybe for a pizza and cocktails it is better"
R0135,They only have two  mexican  beers on offer  Modelo and Corona  which isnt very cool 
R0135,I had visited this place in December 2018  and  was so impressed that I booked a table for my husband  and  I  and  our 2 friends  Very disappointed that we were brought to a table with 5 chairs  but only 4 people  The 5th chair wasnt taken away  Our coats werent taken from us to hang up  as had happened previously  When the food was served  the waiters leaned across the table rather than going around to each person to serve us   and  the food was taken away  and  we hadnt finished our meal  So disappointed as I had recommended  and  booked this restaurants  dont think well be going back
R0135,I have been to several of the restaurants owned by this group and this was by far the worst experience of what is typically an otherwise great experience  The wait staff was irreverent and took a long time to get their attention  They were also visibly standing around joking with each other while we were trying to get their attention   it was quite frustrating  I also noted that there was not one female staff member on the floor while we were there   I am also a meat eater  but do not eat pork  It really limited my options to only a few items when otherwise vegetarian options had pig product in them 
R0135,"I just want to express how disappointed I and we all were last Friday with the customer service provided by one of your staff who was looking after our table  I was very excited to bring my colleagues in as my first time there the staff was lovely  

We completely understand the 2 hours policy  Its a fast paced environment we dont want to become an inconvenience  However that day half of the place was practically empty and the way your staff treated us was unacceptable it was like there were people outside waiting to be seated   He was taking our food without asking  took my friends drink without asking  A simple confirmation would be nice  He was basically pushing and rushing us to finish our food  it was 7:30 and our 2 hours wasnt meant to be up until 8 and we were just finishing up when he comes to the table and grab my plate of pizza which I confirm I was finished with it and me and my other colleague wasnt done with our bowl of chips and just grabs it  One of our colleague came in late and because the place was empty we said ok try to ask for the menu if its ok  but his response was unprofessional and rude  He gave the girl a very rude gesture saying your 2 hours is up what are you going to order in 20 mins  "
R0135,"A policy is a policy and customer service is another story which I believe is the priority for this industry   We would have completely been ok if he came to our table and said "" apologies but due to our 2 hours policy  its not possible to order any more"" etc etc  But he was rushing us and pushing us to leave our table  We were there to enjoy our meal after a busy week at work just like most people who go there   and what we got is possibly the worst customer service Ive ever come across  I was disappointed that I chose this place to bring my work colleagues  To think we paid that much for that value of customer service is unbelievable 
"
R0135,I love this place and am there a lot but on this occasion the service was terrible  we had to ask for everything  and  waiter clearly just forgot we were even there  We were left for around 40 mins after we finished eating  and  had to get a waiters attention for dessert menus  The food was great as always  I told the FOH lady but we left a very small tip because of this 
R0135,I loved the ambiance of the place however the food was just average  I thought the brunch menu was over priced  16 euro for eggs with salmon and salmon was just a tiny piece  We ordered latte but there was no sugar on the table  no salt 
R0135, The latte was spilled on the way and was still served regardless  There s so much hype about the place however we didnt really get the value for money and the service was just average  The place has a potential but I found it a little disappointing as we were looking forward to the experience 
R0135,"I met a friend here for lunch last month and had high hopes as the place was packed  We ordered at the counter and a minute or two later our food was ready 

I had the paleo bowl with chicken and my friend had some kind of pesto pasta  She seemed to like hers but mine was just okay  The bowl itself had decent flavour but the chicken was so dry and bland that it brought the dish down a bit  
Fine for lunch but definitely wont leave you dreaming about returning "
R0135,I ordered the avocado toast  portion size was better than last time I had been  but it was so bland  I could have made better myself  Blueberry pancake was good 
R0135,I was craving noodles  came by here  ordered some pad thai and   was disappointed 
R0135,I was really disappointed with the limited  menu choice  
R0135,I was so surprised how rude the waiters were  They shouted specials at us and threw down dessert menus
R0135,I went with friends for dinner  The starter and cocktails took nearly an hour to arrive  The waiter forgot to order one of our starters so we received it with our main dish  The food was average  but the service was incredibly slow  slow water refills  took a while to bring the bill and the credit card machine  accidentally charged us for an additional dish we didnt get  forgot to put one of the orders in   Has potential to be a lovely place with the ambience and location  but wasnt a great experience 
R0135,I would highly recommend  I have been there for both Brunches  and  Dinners over the last few months  The food is excellent but its the atmosphere that brings us back time and time again   The staff are friendly and always remember customers   They are friendly but not overbearing  The buzz is great  I have more bookings in the diary and plan on spending my birthday there in March 
R0135,"Ive went to this place last week and would not go back  The service was so slow and we had to ask where our food was on numerous occasions  The food was then below average and cold due to the delay  No apologies from the staff until the very end when they knocked half price off our main meals  
Would not recommend to a friend "
R0135,Would not recommend to a friend  Poor service
R0135,Ive been here before for drinks but found that on this occasion for brunch the service was very slow  We got water as soon as we sat down but we were waiting ages to actually order our food and drinks  which once ordered did come very quickly  Then to order a second drink  which we didnt in the end   it was very difficult to get the attention of staff who seemed to be occupied resetting the restaurant  After our table was cleared we decided to just get the bill as nobody came back to take a drink order after we looked at the menu  It was a little disappointing especially as the restaurant wasnt busy when we got there 
R0135,Nothing special  I wouldnt recommend it whatsoever 
R0135,It is structurally a lovely venue  I really didnt enjoy the ham and cheese and there was no cheese  The rigatoni was pleasant enough but very overpriced  
R0135,Dessert was bad
R0135,It is such a great spot  The food  THE PIZZA     ambiance and service were all amazing  Every staff member we dealt with was super nice and professional   A great range of cocktails and I loved that the menu showed what type of glass each one came in  They even made up a cocktail that didnt feature on the menu for my friend  They also had a good selection of non alcoholic beers and mocktails for anyone expecting/non drinkers  Would highly recommend it and cant wait to go back 
R0135,It was amazing I expected nothing less as I am a massive fan of its sister restaurants
R0135,It was nice had a great time
R0135,"It was sunny  I saw their outdoor seating and thought Ill have a quick bite to eat here  I expected it to be touristy and overpriced given the location  but I figured it cant be too bad since it looks nice 

The food was thrown in front of me  and it was just sad  A dry chicken fillet staring into my face  Sad damp pieces of lettuce  Coleslaw was code for a lump of mayo with some cabbages coming out of it  Fries were stale  Really  really bad food "
R0135,Large group and all of our food was delicious  Especially the salmon Benedict  Service was lovely 
R0135,Limited menu  which would be fine if the food was good but unfortunately it wasnt 
R0135,Loved it  great food  and  service and the interiors are fab
R0135,Loved the venue and the food was good  However service was terrible  The restaurant was near on empty and from the second we arrived we were treated like our waiter didnt want us there and put under pressure to order  eat and get out asap  We were only there for about an hour and a half  so didnt even use up our whole table time  yet we were made to feel very unwelcome  Disappointing for such a lovely venue 
R0135,Loved this pleace would recommend to friends and colleagues  The Pizzas are the best  
R0135,Lovely building great views over the river but the food was very average   
R0135,Lovely place but could improve the quality of the food
R0135,Lovely restaurant and tasty food  Staff were excellent and all enjoyed the evening 
R0135,Lovely room  great view of the Liffey  nice furnishings  and  staff were excellent  Food was inedible  pizza   and  bland  pasta   A shame  wont go back 
R0135,Lovely venue   Very noisy   A bit chaotic   Our waiter had a bad attitude  I moved my seat to sit closer to person I was with and he asked me rudely to move it back so I wouldnt be in anyone elses way  I asked the other clientele around me and they said it was no bother at all  Way over prized  for the moderately good food 
R0135,Maybe the dinner menu is better but we felt the brunch menu was very limited  My 2 friends ordered the avocado toast with a side of smoked salmon but the salmon was served on top and cooked the salmon which they found unappetising  The bread underneath was also soggy  I had no complaints with my sausage muffins  We were disappointed that the waitress didnt ask was everything ok when she cleared away 2 nearly full plates of food  Loved the atmosphere but wouldnt come back for brunch 
R0135,Meh  neither good nor bad  Decent enough food  but waiting 45 mins for attention when restaurant/bar was almost empty 
R0135,Most unimpressed with the service  We were advised we would only have the table for two hours despite the restaurant being empty for half the night  Server leaned directly over everyone whilst attending table  Order was incorrect and when correct food was given it was cold  Overpriced bar food  Bar is nice and trendy but I would stick with the drinks 
R0135,My daughter and me went this evening to celebrate her 22nd birthday over dinner  I booked a day ahead with a note that it was my daughters birthday  I also called the restaurant earlier today and spoke to reservations to arrange for a dessert to be brought in after our dinner  on a birthday plate with candles and a birthday message  They confirmed a specific dessert and informed me that it will be done  However  no dessert / birthday message came eventually   we finished our dinner  had dessert cocktails    kept waiting  but nothing came  When the steward came with the bill  I asked to talk to the manager  All that the manager  said was that she was sorry and that they did not get a message from reservations   How can that be    I had mentioned about the birthday even in my booking     so that should be on the system at the minimum    The manager lacked ownership  the apology did not sound sincere enough and there was no attempt towards any loyalty gesture  Extremely disappointing experience     This was our first visit to the restaurant     I will never go back again  The food was good    but service was pathetic 
R0135,The food was good    but service was pathetic 
R0135,Myself and my friends went on Saturday for brunch  It is overpriced but a lovely restaurant with great atmosphere  The food was good however the service was slow  It took ages for the food and also we had to ask twice for water  We asked for the dessert menu and nobody came around to take our order so we just asked for the bill  I had booked on the app and left a message about it being a special occasion  but nothing was recognised for this  Dont think ill be returning  
R0135,Nice atmosphere   service was prompt   overall was good 
R0135,Nice decor   great atmosphere  but this is not a restaurant for good food
R0135,"No spoon on the table for soup order 
Ordered white wine server brought out red 
Lack of communication skills from the waitress  Its the little things "
R0135,Not a great place for dinner  Had brunch there before and it was nice but for dinner its over priced for the food you get  Wouldnt recommend it for dinner
R0135,"On arrival before we got our table we were told we must be finished by 7 30  Good start to our evening  I ordered a vodka and tonic   no Schweppes   Crab salad starter   where was the crab   We ordered a bottle of wine at 7 00 and our waitress questioned whether we were qualified to consume it in our 30 minutes remaining and she asked if she could bring the bill at this time   The experience was further compounded by the arrival of the Manager at 7 20 reminding us that there were people waiting on our table and that we should go now 

The whole experience was unbelievably unprofessional  inhospitable and rude   Producing a stressful memory and ensuring our resolve never to annoy your staff again   "
R0135,On arrival  the employees at the desk were fighting and extremely passive aggressive to one another  Our waitress was extremely pleasant  Very poor vegetarian options   there was one 
R0135,One of my favourite Dublin restaurants  I have been at least 5 times in the past year or so and the food is always excellent  Great drinks selection from the bar and friendly professional staff  Prices are a bit steep  a 2 course meal without drinks could get up to 40 euro per person  especially if you get a steak  but I find the quality of food so good that I think its worth it  Highly recommended  
R0135,The desert was the worst  Much better restaurants in Dublin of much better quality and fair higher standard of food for the same price  
R0135,"Overpriced very average food  I did not finish any of my three courses 

Service was average  We were rushed to finish and asked three times if we were ordering a desert within a very short space of time  Not relaxing "
R0135,Poor food overpriced  No options to add ingredients to pizza therefore Im assuming theyre already pre prepared  Food came out too quickly 
R0135,Why is the menu so limited  Staffing problems  Not good enough for the money being charged 
R0135,Poor menu   too few options  My dish was not up to my expectations of this group of restaurants   I will not be returning  Why is the menu so limited  Staffing problems  Not good enough for the money being charged 
R0135,Poor service  half an hour waiting for table  Bar man didnt open  of pour wine  food wasnt delicious which is what you hope for 
R0135,Really attentive staff and delicious cocktails  Great for a special occasion or brunch with friends
R0135,Really enjoyed it  Food and service was amazing  Highly recommended 
R0135,Really fab place but pizza wasnt good  Pizza shouldnt be a hard thing to get right 
R0135,Really good service  Food excellent too  Highly recommend this place 
R0135,Not worthy of your precious night out
R0135,Really poor experience over all  Very disappointing  Ive been numerous times since opening  Now  its clear that they are just providing a generic experience  with a take it or leave it attitude  Service was lack lustre with attitude  Food over priced  and  mediocre
R0135,It is a lovely restaurant with beautiful  modern interiors  We went there to celebrate my daughters 18th birthday  We were a group of 8 mixed ages with my mum being eldest and my niece 12 the youngest  We were asked three times to take our table even though we arrived on time and had ordered some drinks  When we took the table in the empty part of the room with no atmosphere it felt uncomfortable 
R0135,The waiter was nice but then before our coffee order he left to �go on his break� and from then we were on our own  Coffee order was lost twice and then we were asked to move from the table as they needed to clean the area we were sitting in  Menu very limited also  I would not recommend this restaurant if you would like something special 
R0135,"Rude and rushed 
This is certainly not a restaurant that valued us as customers  While it may be a nice venue for drinks  I would actively advise not to go here for dinner  The service was slow and yet we got pushed off our table after 2 hours exactly   we were made feel like we were part of a factory process  churning through as many people as possible as quickly as possible  Important to note that nowhere on our reservation was the two hour restriction mentioned  nor on the reservation confirmation call that I received the day before 
The food is good  but not near good enough to warrant such arrogance  The restaurant manager was extremely rude when we mentioned our complaint to him   we will not be back "

R0135,"Rushed     Told at 8:20 that our table would be needed at 8:30 although we were told nine   Only finished our main courses at 8:20  due to slow service  didnt have time for desert    this s is a beautiful restaurant but thats about it   More customer focus needed   I can see this place fizzling out  


The food 
Bread   two mini loafs of brown bread looked nice   however tasted stale and very hard to cut  
Starters  were nice I had the pork belly and lentils and my friend had the braised beef    
Mains   Pizzas   Not great   nothing special   could of got nicer elsewhere or out of dominos   
Sides   chips were delicious   We also ordered tempura courgettes that never arrived   we were not charged  
Dessert   couldnt have as we had 10 minutes go get it and eat it  

Cocktails   Delicious 

Bill was  Euro 84   we did leave a tip as the waiter was nice and it wasnt the waiters fault as to why we had to leave or why our main was slow coming out  

Would I recommend   No

Why   
Can get better service /food  for a fraction of the cost elsewhere in Dublin"
R0135,Rushed off our table even though restaurant wasnt full 
R0135,Said I wouldnt go back the last time  But gave it another go  Awful food  Terrible service  to the point of having to look for staff  Overpriced poor food  Nice interior but now feels out of fashion  followed a trend that now looks so lame 
R0135,Service very disappointing  Would not return or recommend 
R0135,Service was particularly good  Girl who served was above and beyond 
R0135,Service was terrible  From the moment we arrived  we were told we had to give the table back by 8  only giving us 2 hours to have a meal and drinks   The last half hour of our meal we were given our bill without asking and within 2 minutes we were instructed to pay  Really bad service and not accommodating at all 
R0135,Slow service  forgettable food  loud
R0135,Poor choice especially only one steak and came with sauce on steak after specifically asking for it on the side  3 potatoes which were over cooked and totally not worth the price paid 
R0135,Standard of food was below expectations especially in caparison to the prices 
R0135,Starter was nice but pizzas were awful  Way too much cheese  Was just a tasteless soggy mess  Very little ambience  Place doesnt really have an identity  Kind of feels like a school hall or canteen after restaurant closes 
R0135,Starter  crab salad was very boring for the price  Air conditioning too high  noise levels ridiculous  a place for the young Im afraid  would not go back
R0135,"Starters were brought back  

Mains were very average

Wine selection wasnt great  

Mix up with bill at tyre B

Nice venue "
R0135,"Sunday brunch: nice place  friendly staff but very expensive for what you get  The quality of the food is pretty poor  Eggs Benedict  Euro 16 with potatoes only half cooked 
We now know why the place was half empty on a Sunday at lunch time "
R0135,Super place   Food very good  Really nice place   Good music
R0135,Super restaurant  we were well looked after  even though it was v busy
R0135,Super service  and  excellent food could not fault one thing 
R0135,Tasty food and great service   Tables at windows have a great view   Tables spaced out nicely 
R0135,Tedious and absent table service  Complaint emailed  Willing to listen and try again depending on response  Bar service atrocious 
R0135,Tasty food  nice atmosphere 
R0135,"The atmosphere was good  especially as it got darker outside  The lady who served us was great 

The food though was very disappointing  it seemed like quantity was emphasised over quality  It was too expensive for what was served  
The serving of cod for the main course was very large  tasteless and not cooked through  raw in the centre  My husbands steak went cold very fast and as a result was not enjoyable beyond the first couple of bites  Our daughters had pasta and pizza and were happy with their food  
Given the cost of the main course it was not good to be asked to spend another  Euro 10 per person for potatoes and vegetables  

It was our daughters birthday so we did not want to make a fuss over the food but I would not be recommending this restaurants to anyone for food  Our experience was that we were charged a lot for very poor food  
Just also to note that the absence of a vegetarian option for the main course was unusual "
R0135,The decor is amazing  a very special venue  Food was middle of the road  Pity  Also food was not hot  Very happening place  young stylish crowd 
R0135,The food was a massive let down  Nobody enjoyed their mains  The service and the drinks were good and the place looks great but would not recommend as it is pricey for a very average meal 
R0135,The food was alright  although the main concern has been the service  The waiter mistaken our orders twice and we have been charged for the wrong orders as well  Overall I wouldnt recommend
R0135,The food was cold for all 7 of us  The space is great so thats unfortunate 
R0135,The food was great but the experience not so good  I get that restaurants want to turn around tables fast but 2 hour slots for meals do not make for a relaxing experience  We wanted to have a drink after we had finished dinner as we normally would in a restaurant  Not a whole session just a drink  But we were moved off the table and could not get seats in the bar  We asked staff if we could sit back down as our table was still empty but they said no  We then asked could we have to space at the bar vacated by the next occupiers of our table  the staff said we could but then disappeared not to be seen again  It seems you actually have to reserve space at the bar     We stood to finish our drinks and then left  So while we enjoyed dinner the after dinner experience spoiled that for us 
R0135,The food was incredibly disappointing  The price did not reflect the quality of fare served  Otherwise  the venue is great with a buzzy atmosphere  pleasant staff and an appealing interior  Unfortunately due to the standard of food  I would not recommend this restaurants for dinner  One could always pop in for happy hour/late night drinks  Improve the food and this place could be a real gem 
R0135,"The food was just fine  Only fine 

Our bill was  Euro 84 we left  Euro 100 we had every intention of leaving a 10 percent tip  However she never returned with any change which is just bad manners"
R0135,"When we were leaving there was 2 receptionists standing there and they didnt even say goodbye or thank you 

So will not be back EVER"
R0135,The food was nothing special  portions are too small yet everything is still over priced  My  Euro 8 chocolate dessert was the silliest plate of food I have ever been served  It looked like half of it was missing 
R0135,"The food was terrible  I only had a pizza and it was heavy  greasy and tasteless  I didnt finish it which is really unusual for me 
Bless them though  nice staff but I wont be back "
R0135,"The good points were that this is a lovely room and the staff were friendly for the most part  There were few mistakes with our order and the staff were great at making it right 
Less good points were the bouncer outside who was surly to the point of rudeness barely speaking on arrival and not even acknowledging a goodbye when we left  We were seated right next to other parties to the point that we might easily join in their conversations because we were so close as to be uncomfortable  I guess it is ok when the place is busy but it was not even a third full "
R0135,The kitchen closes too early and the place was too noisy
R0135,The mushroom linguine was wonderful however the experience was rather disappointing  I had booked in advance for my mums birthday so I thought wed get a nice enough table  Instead we were brought over to a fairly basic looking small table with loads of empty seats/nice booths around  but with no people in them   We felt excluded from the buzzing atmosphere you see when you first enter and instead  we were in a whole section on our own for the entire evening which was right beside the staff station 
R0135,The pan fried hake with a Wasabi mouse and ginger was outstanding  Fabulous service too   
R0135,The place is really nice and staff is very pleasant  however the ambience is not as expected  We had a pizza that was taffy  a salad that was OK  not very tasty for its price and very small and a chicken with carrots that was small and chicken without any flavor at all 
R0135,Very loud with ecco everywhere  too dark and food was not tasty at all  Price vs value was not as expected at all 
R0135,The place is very nice and has really good service  The food was disappointing  worst pasta we had in a fancy place  3 of us ordered it and think the same  was expensive and the shrimps were smaller than an instant noodle soup 
R0135,Overkill    Not only did we feel rushed out the door from the moment we arrived but he finished by being extremely rude  He was tall  sort of spiky haired  not Irish   wish id gotten his name  He was totally obnoxious  The reason im recommending the place for pre theatre is that its ideal for when youre in a rush  The staff are just short of shoving you down the stairs  
R0135,The place itself is nice but our waiter ruined the night for the 3 of us  If we were told once  we were told a thousand times we had the table for a set period of time 
R0135,The place was very busy and as a result incredibly noisy  All the hard surfaces dont help the acoustics  Service quite slow but at least they didnt hustle us off the table after the agreed two hour window  which was good 
R0135,The service in here was really bad  we were there for my birthday brunch and there was very little option on the menu  Trying to order a drink was a nightmare  the place was not the busy and yet we would be waiting 10mins at times to get the attention of one of the servers  We were told we could sit until 4 30 and at 4 10 we were asked to pay our bill and if we wanted to get a drink we would have to go to the bar where we also were not getting served  Over all not a great experience and wont be rushing back 
R0135,The service is always great  have been a few times with big and small groups  never disappoints
R0135,"The service was amazing and its a lovely setting  The food was just so bland and overcooked though 

I had the breakfast muffins  they were dry beyond belief  Im a regular customer and the breakfast muffin served down there is much nicer  My friend had the burger and it too was so dry and the bun fell apart which would indicate it was not fresh 

Im not one to complain and I will be back again as maybe the kitchen had an off day but honestly  the food was not good on the day in question "
R0135,The service wasnt great to be honest but the food was delicious 
R0135,The service  drinks  atmosphere is great  The food lives up to the standard of all the above 
R0135,The staff could not have been more accommodating to my friend who was in a cast  They made sure that we had a table at the bar after our booking as she was unable to stand  The food was delicious  highly recommend 
R0135,"The venue decor is nice  the atmosphere is lively and the food is good/average for a city centre restaurant 
They are the only good things that I can say about it 
The service is mediocre  at best 
The wine list is average/poor and seriously over priced 
My friend and I could hardly hear each other talk  thanks to a combination of the DJ starting up and two very drunk tables close to us 
The restaurant was also uncomfortably warm 
Overall  it was a poor experience and I will not return "
R0135,"The venue looks fine  location is central and staff is ok too  

My main issues with the place are a  I requested a small birthday dessert and they forgot  b  food portions while pricey are ridiculously small and finally c  aperol spritz is mostly load of prosecco with ice "
R0135,The waiter was very attentive and professional   The hostesses need to work on their behaviour   After cocktails  starters  two bottles of wine and mains  they never once checked on our table until they needed the table back   At which time they never had the courtesy to ask us themselves but sent the waiter instead   Poor form and very unprofessional  I like the venue but the management needs work 
R0135,"My husband was given a flat pint of Guinness that looked like it had been sitting on the bar for hours when he asked for a fresh one the waiter questioned him quite rudely and then took 30 minutes to bring a fresh one  The service did not improve for the rest of the night  We asked what was the fish of the day and he grunted ""theres no fish we only changed the menu today""
That sums up my birthday night at this restaurant   "
R0135,The worst service I have come across in a restaurant in a very long time 
R0135,Trendy stylish bar with delicious cocktails  Service was pretty good  My food selections were overall very disappointing  Would probably order pizza or salad next time as my cod  main  was tasteless and my iberico ham   starter  lacked flavour   I wouldnt recommend for dinner or any special occasion 
R0135,Trendy yet cosy atmosphere  Perfect for brunch  Amazing food  the Eggs Benedict and Blueberry pancakes are highly recommended 
R0135,"Unfortunately food and service were really poor  While the furniture  setup and bar are very cool  For example our table had to request water from our server  some 4+ times before it arrived  And again multiple times for a second top up  Food offering is very limited   menu very small  Drinks were nice and enjoyable  

 Disappointed  as really wanted to like it "
R0135,"Unfortunately this was a very poor experience  Menu direction is all over the place and descriptions are rather odd : a popsicle turned out to be a filled pasta dish  Duck pizza was very under baked   so much so that it wasnt charged for 
It will be  some time before I or my host will be back  indeed I havery declined an invitation to meet others there next week   A bright buzzy place  OK service   but needs to find its feet in terms of its food offer "
R0135,Unreal design and look  great staff and atmosphere   Best i have been in years
R0135,V disappointed  food awful  will never ever go back 
R0135,V disappointing food  V expensive  V noisy  Didnt like being stuck in middle aisle 
R0135,Venue is good with the bar also  Food was just very average  I got the sausage pasta for main  and  there was barely any sausage in it  Got the financier dessert  Financiers were nice but a bit of a bizarre combination with creme anglaise  and  sorbet  Disappointed with the food hence would not be in a hurry to go back  despite the good venue 
R0135,Very average high priced food  Seating arrangements quite crowded and difficult to get staffs attention for service  Quite disappointing 
R0135,Very disappointed  it was very cold where our seats was  food was ok  not value for money  Dont Think it is a place for dining as a couple  very loud  Our desert was the worse I ever seen  It was berries Elton mess  Which was a bought hard merguire broke up and a few berries over it  discussing at a cost of 10 Euro  Will not be recommending this restaurant to any one  This was a very speacial ocassion for us but turned out disappointed  
R0135,Very enjoyable dinner in beautiful surroundings  Will definitely be back on my next trip to Dublin 
R0135,Very expensive tables very close togetherange not for a date requested a booth never got wanting a table of four instead for thats dublin for u the now money money lack of customerservice
R0135,Very happy with the food and service  Would definitely recommend 
R0135,Very limited menu and very overpriced  Nice ambience and bar area but definitely not value for money 
R0135,Very nice food and really nice place but the service was quite lacking
R0135,"Very over priced food and wine  
Nice dining room and decor but very cold where we were sitting and even after asking our waiter if a door could be closed behind our table  it was still left open 
Rushed off our table at short notice despite not being told a specific time the table was needed back at the start of our meal  Told we could then finish our drinks at the bar but no seats available there so we had to sit outside in the terrace where there werent even any functioning heaters 
I will not be returning "
R0135,Very overpriced and my steak was nothing but a lump of fat  Never again 
R0135,Very poor service  Table booked for 8pm and rang earlier in the day to see could we have an earlier seating they said no  Arrived at 8pm and the restaurant was empty 
R0135,VERY VERY NOISY  IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAR ANYBODY IN MY TABLE 
R0135,Waitress was fab 
R0135,Was a good meal  Service could of been better as where waiting a while for drinks
R0135,Was there for my Birthday  Absolutely loved it  Reasonably priced  Food and drinks were lovely 
R0135,Was traveling to ireland for my partners birthday and booked this restaurant to celebrate it in  Food was delicious  cocktails were even better  Service was great  both really enjoyed everything ans the atmostphere  Would highly recommend 
R0135,We arrived at 8 30 and our table wasnt ready  We were seated by 8 45  but no food arrived until 9 45  When we complained a 10 percent discount was given on the bill which wa gratefully received but unfortunately the delay meant we ate much later than planned and changed our evening 
R0135,We booked a table early evening few drinks and food    everything was great loved the place
R0135,We booked a table of 6 for New Years Eve  We got a comfortable booth for dinner and we were able to keep it for the rest of the night  Service was really good  our waiter was great  however the food was a big let down  Prices are high so I was expecting a high standard of dishes  The starters were good overall  but the mains were less than average  Two of my friends had the steak and it was unedable  Meat tasted sour and burned  The gnocchi was only ok and the chicken was dry    the waiter took one of the steaks of the bill  I dont think I will come back as there are nicer restaurants in Dublin especially in the same price bracket as this restaurants
R0135,We had a 6 30 p m  booking  the service was very bad  our food arrived at 8 p m 
R0135,We have been here before and bought friends   They liked it as much as we do  Thanks for a lovely evening 
R0135,"We ordered our �hot choc and a lemon cheese cake    Unfortunately we received 3 forks and 1 knife and    lemon morangs    Ai  After asking to get a knife  we got another fork    Mmmm    Bad start

Ok  when we got what we ordered  it was tasty indeed  but its far from what I was hoping: a bit slushy  and misses the kick I was hoping for  the lemon attack of my taste buds  Petty   "
R0135,"I ordered the pepperoni pizza which was soggy and bland  However  my two friends ordered other pizzas and said they were lovely  I was just disappointed in mine as a pepperoni pizza is always a good choice as it is hard to get wrong  

Overall  not thrilled about the experience with the food and the service but the place is nicely decorated and the drinks were tasty "
R0135,We waited about 10 minutes to have our orders taken  when we had to actually stop a waiter and ask them if we could order now  We also had to ask him then if we could order drinks as no one had come to take our drinks order 
R0135,We went after the mini marathon  I had a pizza and my friend had a mushroom pasta  The pizza was ok but not worth  Euro 16  I didnt like the pasta at all  Overall the service was great the restaurant is beautiful but the food was bland and overpriced  Dont think I would be back for dinner  Maybe give brunch a try at some point
R0135,We went  with our children  I had been there several times before and loved it so was looking forward to taking my husband  My husband and daughters meal were poor  lukewarm and lacking in flavor  Sophie had the prawn pasta  she left most of it on the plate  when I mentioned it to the waitress she told me it was the most popular dish  My husband had the duck which was over cooked   Both my son and my meal were excellent 
R0135,We were celebrating my daughters 19th birthday  We had 4 steaks which were not tender and badly cooked  The potatoes were over cooked  I had also requested a birthday cake which they totally forgot  Very disappointed
R0135,"We were expecting a christmas lunch menu but got a very poor brunch menu instead and the food itself was just about ok
There was a large groupopo of men seated beside us and we could barely hear ourselves talk
The staff were pleasant"
R0135,We were quite disappointed with the service told we have to leave or table before our end of time which was 2 30pm  All the waitress cared about was getting the bill sorted  and  that was it   we ended up carrying our own drinks  and  a bottle of wine to the bar before 2 30pm  no assistance offered  We would have stayed longer at the bar for more drinks but left after the wine was finished  Felt very rushed overall  
R0135,"Were we seated on the fair corner and pretty much forgotten by the waiters  Everything was hard to get  menus  drinks  food  dessert menu  bill  
It would be understandable if the place was packed  however  it wasnt that busy  
Pretty disappointing  and stressful brunch "
R0135,"Were we seated on the fair corner and pretty much forgotten by the waiters  Everything was hard to get  menus  drinks  food  dessert menu  bill  
It would be understandable if the place was packed  however  it wasnt that busy  
Pretty disappointing  and stressful brunch "
R0135,"While the food was very good  the service was a big let down   

The first of our party  3 people  arrived at 18 50 for a table booked at 19 00  Upon arriving they were asked if this was it of if the rest of the party was on the way  They waitress was advised that the rest of the party are on the way  We were then asked the same question when each person arrived  Drinks had been ordered so it wasnt that the table was being held up with no money being made  Before the last of our party arrived we were asked if we would be having wine  As we didnt have the full party  and  those there already had drinks we couldnt answer  When the last of our party arrived menus were placed in our hands  and  we were told that they need to get the order in as they will need this table back  Most of the party hadnt really got time to even look at the menu but orders where given  And again the wine question was asked but before we could answer the glasses were removed  and  we were told they can bring the back if we order wine 

When the starters arrived they were very nice but we felt very rushed to finish as the waitress hoovered around until the last folk full was eaten  This was the theme for the night  The same happened with mains  and  it ""most get order in"" happened for deserts as well as the hanging around waiting for us to finish 

We tried not to feel rushed but this was very difficult and the only time we were left alone was when we had paid the bill  Then they never came near us again while we finished our drinks  not being asked if we wanted more   The kitchen closed  and  the table was not required as the waitress appeared to understand 

I understand that staff have lives  and  kitchen need to close etc  is this really necessary 

Would I eat here again  not for the service  and  not for the price  To celebrate a birthday this is not the way you want an evening to go "
R0135,Would be nice to sit at the waterfont  Nice place but a bit noisy 
R0135,Would have preferred a fuller menu rather than purely a brunch menu running through the day  Service was very slow as didnt appear to have enough staff to cope with the customers 
R0136,10/10 manager was exceptional
R0136,Always like this place but the service was very bad    Forgot our wine and had to follow it up   Food slapped down on us and wine crafe slapped onto where dinner plate was supposed be going   Had to ask for empty water bottles to be taken away even after they gave us new ones   Not good enough service for the price    Manager was filthy dirty with sloppy hair and suit
R0136,Amazing place and voted as the best place for wings in Dublin  The food is really tasty and portions were great  Waiting line for the place was about 20 minutes as it was packed  For sure one of my favourite places to eat in Dublin
R0136,"As alway  the food was very good  However  the service was very disappointing
and has undoudtedly deteriorated compared to how it used to be  We found the staff to be poorly trained and not at all attentive  The manager showed little or no interest in his job or his staff  
Overall  it was not the experience we would have expected and enjoyed previously"
R0136,"As usual problem using voucher  We did not receive the ""requested"" voucher confirmation  used the restaurants site to book table and added on the site an email asking would there be an issue with the voucher as have experienced every single time a problem   no reply to email   We werent the only people on the night that gas this problem  It need to learn about customer service its non existent  Food was good however"
R0136,Buzzing atmosphere   Excellent food   Very attentive service   A very enjoyable and pleasant experience
R0136,"Cute place  The largest collection of beer Ive seen  Great vibe  But management should pay closer attention to their personal  The bartender was rude at the beginning  which i thought is ok   and then a huge pile of dirty glasses was fallen on me because a poor waitress slipped over on the floor and almost fell  Noone even apologized  It was odd to see other customers coming over and trying to help me or ask if I am fine  
Really upsetting in the service "
R0136,Dining room was dirty  After highlighting cobwebs and dirt in December  was shocked to see it worse on this visit 
R0136,Enjoyed the late lunch  the food was okay good service from our waitress Maria  however received an attitude from a dark haired waitress after we asked her for a bill since we couldnt see Maria  Thats just made the whole experience Negative 
R0136,"Excellent food let down by very poor service 
The staff would appear not to be trained in any way at all   
Three different staff had to be involved in ordering a gin and tonic  
Shame   food is good  and reasonably expensive   so what a let down to run a restaurant without training the staff who serve the customers 
Will not be going back and would not recommend "
R0136,Excellent food and service  We have dined here many times and would highly recommend it 
R0136,Excellent service by all the staff  Very attentive without being overly so  A lovely special night out with excellent food  Would recommend to anyone 
R0136,Extremely noisy restaurant  Food just ok   Way over priced
R0136,Fantastic as  Always  will definitely be back soon
R0136,Food is fine  Delivery is awful  Always late with no knowledge of the the area and often have some of the order missing  Dreadful 
R0136,Food very old fashioned and not well executed
R0136,Food was excellent  Service was appalling  Very slow  We were forgotten about in the corner  Waiter tried to make it up to us by offering us free desserts but too late 
R0136,food was good however front of house service was shockingly poor   was told I didnt have a reservation until I had to prove that I had   once I found the email I was told well ok but you will to have to leave in 1 5 hours   really bad
R0136,Food was good  potato and veg portions smaller than usual  Service was absolutely diabolical  Restaurant manager was very apologetic  gave a cake to my mother  we were out for her birthday  and offered us a round of free drinks  Hes a credit to the restaurant and only for him the experience would have been terrible  Weve been visiting here for years and gave serious consideration to not going back again 
R0136,Food was lovely  great flavor however service was very poor  Not friendly  made you feel they wanted you to go as soon as possible  even though we came on time and not for the latest service  Removed napkins during main courses  didnt provide any new ones   we have to ask  It was good food but I wouldnt go back as there was no warmth  its quiet loud but the main reason is the service or lack of  Its a shame as based on the quality of food it could be such a nice place to eat in 
R0136,"Food was ordinary
Took forever to get served  and even longer to pay the bill
Staff were having a barney"
R0136,For breakfast or beverages  go elsewhere  Cost saving methods like deep frying the black and white pudding and possibly the mushrooms is disgusting and unfortunately so widespread in this country  Their prices are very high for the standard you receive  
R0136,Good food  Decent service  Would consider returning but definitely check out the lobster burger if you do  You wont be disappointed
R0136,Good place to eat in Dublin   Generous staff and clean  food so testy and good service 
R0136,Great food  pleasant atmosphere and service and attentive waiting staff  recommended
R0136,Great food service and value   our go to restaurant in Dublin
R0136,"I am normally OVERWHELMED but this experience was my first Less Than Average experience  Felt rushed  No one was attentive  We had to ask for a drink  Poor service and we felt like we were just being pushed through  
I booked online and asked for a booth  No reference to my booking and we were just parked at a table in the corner 
Not impressed "
R0136,"I booked through app  Received confirmation email on booking  The restaurant rang me at 2pm on day of booking to say they cant do the time  7pm  after receiving confirmation and could I do 9pm  I was really annoyed at late notice as we found it very difficult to book another venue  
Ive used the app in London New York and never had a problem"
R0136,"I cancelled my reservation as I had had such a poor meal on 30th August 2017 
I will never go there again  "
R0136,I had made reservations for the restaurant but when I arrived found there had been a mistake with online reservation and there was no space for me  It had been a thirty minute walk from my hotel  so I accepted a seat on the casual bistro side  Obviously menu was not the same as the one I had looked forward to from other side of restaurant  I ordered shrimp  which was deep fried and served with French fries   They were small and tasteless  Ugh  Wine was nice 
R0136,I have been here on many occasions  The experience was a shade below normal and less than expected  Difficult to describe why  maybe it was our location  but bit difficult to put into words 
R0136,I love this place   Super service   Nice pints of Guinness   No rip off feeling as prices very competitive  Might just give better warning re 10 percent service charge  
R0136,I took my son to this place for his 35th birthday as he likes to go there  It would not be my 1st preference  especially as it has got so expensive  there is no  2 course option and they  slap on a 10 percent service charge  We were both happy with our meal  However  we got a very badly placed table and when the window table to our left was vacated the staff thought nothing of gaining access to clear this table by pushing and moving and interrupting my son a number of times before we requested that they desist  as this is not the way to treat a diner in any restaurant  We made the maitre dee aware of what went on and he apologised and offer my son a free drink which he did not avail of as he was leaving and didnt want another drink  I might add that the staff in question appeared to find nothing wrong with their behaviour 
R0136,"I was disappointed that special deal  Euro 29 95
For 3 courses did not include coffee  I did not have starter so thought 3 course would include coffee instead  also I thought desert was rather sparse "
R0136,it is very elegant and comfortable  We found the portions small and the service haphazard  however  Genuine friendliness by staff and value for money generally bring me back to a restaurant  they need to work on these  in my opinion  I dont mind paying for a meal that is ample  We were three hungry men but the portions were more suited to older people with small appetites  Go up a notch with better service and more on the plate and they will be first class 
R0136,It�not good for tourists  They messed up our order  �Food is greasy  Hash browns from frozen patties  not fresh  �Even the tea is soso
R0136,Khan was a real gentleman  fantastic maitred  Broccoli was slightly over cooked unfortunately  fantastic meal overall  Be back soon
R0136,Look  its good but nothing out of the ordinary  the beer selection is terrible 
R0136,Meal was late  confusion as to what  was it was not included in menus  simple things like salt cellars being empty  questionable as to whether Guinness was Guinness and not Murphys  NO value for money
R0136,Messed up my wedding party  Poor management
R0136,"Myself and partner went for a bite of lunch  we were left standing before anyone came to us for 15 minutes  

We were then seated and I asked what was the soup and the waiter didnt know even though he had just served it to the table beside us  He eventually came back  

Got soup with no spoon had to ask twice for one  Had to ask 3 times for a glass of water 

The service was horrendous and will not be returning"
R0136,New York Deli  Irish hospitality  killer combination 
R0136,"Ok but felt like they were just turning over tables  
Service was good but impersonal  Some staff members could take more care of their appearance "
R0136,"On arrival  the receptionist made no attempt to help my colleague with her coat and asked me to leave my umbrella at the door in a receptacle containing at least six others  When I asked if it was a safe place to leave my umbrella  she was dismissive 
We were then brought directly to a table containing six other diners  When we pointed out that we were not members of that group  there was no apology 
The tables are too small and too close together  The noise level was deafening  You could plainly hear the conversations on either side of our table  The service was appalling  Amateur at best 
The restaurant was full  I cannot understand why 
Take my advice and give it a miss "
R0136,One Word  DELICIOUS  The only fault was the steak main course but all other courses were amazing  The atmosphere upscale with friendly service 
R0136,Outstanding dining experience   Wine selection was great as well as the food   The service was excellent   Everyone was friendly and helpful   I had a local dish and I loved it   Would highly recommend dining here 
R0136,Staff were friendly  Delicious fresh  home cooked food  Presented beautifully  Cured my hangover Slept like a baby 
R0136,"Stopped in here for a quick bite and a pint on the halfway point of the long walk back to our hotel from city center  The pints were good  the service was fine   i �wouldnt recommend getting oysters here �  as the review says  ""meh   Ive had much better"""
R0136,"Stopped in for a late night meal    
Fun place  cute decor    Burgers were good  loved the sweet potato fries  Waitstaff was friendly"
R0136,The service was lacking and entirely dependent on which member of staff arrived over  generally found the male staff very helpful   A half jug of water arrived and landed on the table with no effort to fill a glass  the food was tasty although again the waitress made no effort to accommodate allergies  To top it off I checked my receipt after leaving and was clearly overcharged for desserts and alcohol I did not have  Recommend to avoid 
R0136,They dont look at online bookings for breakfast   we booked and got an email acknowledgement but when we arrived we were told they dont book breakfasts   we had to show a staff member our email acknowledgement     moral    ring this restaurant
R0136,This is a well managed restaurant with good quality food being serviced  Whole experience pleasant and friendly 
R0136,"This restaurant is hugely over priced whilst  at the same time  the service is at best ""clinical"" in the sense that the waiting staff almost go out of their way not to develop any rapport with the customer  I would certainly never go there again "
R0136,Tourist trap  The advertising picture was Irish dancers so I assumed the dancers would play a large part in the performance  I was very wrong  I would say there was only dancing 15 percent of the whole performance  Most of it was men who played instruments and sang  Dont get me wrong  they were very talented and great performers but almost every bar or pub in Dublin has Irish singers or performers throughout the week so this is not much of a novelty  Food was pretty meh  They have a 3 course meal option but it was all subpar and didnt fill me up  Ended up going to get food afterwards  I got the ham hock for my first course and it was dry and I didnt eat much of it  Second course got the salmon option  It wasnt the worse thing Ive eaten but it had no flavor  I got the mini trio of deserts  They were the best part but you could probably buy the same at Tescos  The server was very disorganized  I think he had too many tables and wasnt able to manage all of the work  Kept asking for water and I never got it  When I got the bill it was priced wrong and I received anothers persons bill that had many upcharges and liquor  They had the wrong bill too  We all played pass your bill to the next person until you find the right one  All in all food was not worth it and the entertainment wasnt anything unique that you wouldnt be able to see at a pub for free  They shouldnt have Irish dancers as the advertising picture when that isnt the main act  Very misleading 
R0136,Trip to Ireland for St  Patricks Day and visiting some relatives 
R0136,Unfortunately the restaurant was extremely busy and the service was absolutely dreadful 
R0136,Very busy restaurant  Tables turned multiple times  Service is brusque  rushed   Food good   noisy crushed atmosphere  Overpriced 
R0136,Very disappointed  the whole meal felt very rushed  food was ok but  expensive for what it was 
R0136,Very disappointing    Asked to adjust air con 4 times and didnt make any difference    Had to sit for two hours in a very cold enviroment 
R0136,"We are regulars we live in Ballsbridge
But Saturday we where unhappy with our sitting area It was my birthday so we did not enjoy I think the management must have changed for the worst not impressed "
R0136,"We came here on a Thursday morning around 10 for brunch as a group of 5 + 1 child  �The place is on the top floor 1  �Lack of service : There were only a few other tables of customers for brunch when we came  We were seated right away but the waiter took A LONG TIME to come back and take our orders  
2  �A bit pricey: yogurt with fresh fruit  and  granola  porridge  or fruit cup will cost you  Euro 7 9 while main dishes like french toast  pancakes  full Irish breakfast  eggs benedict will cost you  Euro 13 15  Coffee and lattes are  Euro 3 3 5
3  �No kids menu or half portion for the kid size
�"
R0136,We got off to a very bad start with our drinks order of gin  at tonic  It took 4 attempts to get 2 drinks correct  We had at least 6 different waiters and waitresses and only asked if everything was alright by our dessert waiter  Food was fine but overpriced  Service was not great and it felt like everyone around us got served before us  Sadly wouldnt be in a hurry back 
R0136,We had called ahead for a reservation because we were a party of 8  When we arrived there was no table available  We had to wait for 15 minutes  The fish and chips was big enough for my wife and I to split and also share a salad but it was just average  It was convenient because it was just across from our lousy hotel but I cant rave about the service or the food
R0136,We have been their customers since they opened and always enjoyed both parts of the restaurant until we used your vouchers for 4 out of 5 of us following a graduation last week  When I said we got vouchers that day the atmosphere from the staff soured/ the service went downhill/ the fish portions were certainly much smaller than the table beside us   who ordered the same meal  They pestered us at least 5 times to buy drinks  2 of us were not driving and had beer and wine  It got to the point I had to state the other 3 of us were driving  I had to repeatedly ask for water
R0136,"On arriving we found
Two dirty glasses and spoon on the table   Cold water was not cold we had to ask for ice 
Service very slow we were given three potatoes for four people  wine  was was not poured
for us and no one asked through the meal was everything ok 
The manager was informed of our experiences when paying our bill and they did apologise and deducted cost of wine 
I would be reluctant to use online app again as we had guests with us and we were totally embarrased with the attitude of the front of house"
R0136,We were sat in a booth in the most uncomfortable seating Ive ever sat on in a restaurant  Plus we were very low down and felt we were reaching up to the table to eat   My daughters chicken fish was terrible  Rest of food very good  Would never go back or recommend due to such poor seating  Inexcusable really 
R0136,Weekend away in Dublin  and  we were lucky to get in  Bustling restaurant with Great food  atmosphere  good wine list  and  attentive staff  Will be back 
R0136,What a beautiful restaurant  Very cozy and comfortable  The food and service were excellent also  we really enjoyed it 
R0137,"A colleague really wanted to eat here and we were in a rush  so against my better judgment we went 

This location is the absolute worst among its chain in Ireland  �The food is fine  its the overpriced tripe youd expect  but the serving staff is a different monster altogether 

The waitress we had seemed determined to maximise the bill  �She said some nonsense about charging for tap water  0 20  �Charging for sauce  �Saying shes doing us a favour by accepting a free chip voucher  with purchase of a burger   �I inquired as to why this was a favour  as it was not expired and specifically states this location on the voucher   her reply was that management decided not to honour them anymore "
R0137,Absolutely trash no flavor and over cooked and no sauce with the meal  Guy asked me if I wanted salt and vinegar I said yes but there wasnt any not worth the walk and not worth the hassle of not having a place to sit and eat  You would only enjoy these fish and chips if you are transparent
R0137,"After extensive travel i arrived with one of my friends to a colleagues birthday party 
She had booked this venue for 130 people and this place aint cheap 
The waiter was not efficient enough to handle the party  We had to wait for him to come  "
R0137,Beautiful venue  Terrible service  Might be a nice place for drinks but I wouldnt rush back for meal 
R0137,Cant fault the sandwiches from here but the past few times Ive been here the guy handling the money at the till has touched my sandwich or the guy making my sandwich has then taken the money off me  with his gloves on  and has gone back to making the sandwiches  Its something Im really sensitive about   maybe Im being too precious 
R0137,"Cheap  cheerful  all you can eat Chinese buffett  �Very popular and open really late  �Contemporary and tasteful decor  �

A wide range of dishes to choose from  �Admittedly  you will find the odd item thats been under the heat lamp for too long  �But then this is a cheap all you can eat buffett   what do you expect "
R0137,Crap management at weekend  Avoid coffee dock sat and sunday   they ignore waiting customers 
R0137,Delicious tasty food Central They know what theyre doing  
R0137,"Disappointed  Weather was bad and Dublin had gone into siege mode  All the more reason to conjure up a warm welcome   It didnt happen 
Shown to the worst table in the place by an extremely brusque young man and given a very
limited cafe menu  Then left with no explanations regarding the availability of any other menus  Eventually we were served a drink by an equally brusque young woman and left to our own devices  
We decided to abort our visit and it was only then
that a more senior gentleman became involved  He was charming and very understanding but by then wed decided to seek food elsewhere
I have been coming to this place for a number of years on my visits to Dublin and was so looking forward to my meal   Hence disappointment "
R0137,Excellent  friendly service  good menu and good food
R0137,Fantastic meal and service   would highly recommend 
R0137,Food was ok   from what I had been told  I was expecting a lot more from this place  On arrival at 4 55pm  having shown the details of my reservation for 5pm  I was told by the floor manager We dont open until 5 30pm and the chef doesnt start cooking until then  Oh  youre in the cafe   Not the most pleasant of greetings    Will not be returning 
R0137,Good food and excellent service in beautiful surroundings   Well worth a visit especially if it is a special occasion 
R0137,Great as always  Food is excellent and their set menu is brilliant value for the quality of the food  Staff are always lovely and service is good  It is a local gem 
R0137,Great place to eat  good food   spectacular environment  Good for conversation and the owner   Veryyy friendly    
R0137,Having been here previously on this occasion it was not up to the standard of previous visits     Staff were not too busy and we had to ask twice for a drink already ordered    Being Xmas time no athmosphere  We were perhaps 1 st booking to arrive in the evening of Xmas week and felt it should have been busier    Based on this visit we wouldnt be in a hurry to return  
R0137,I had been meaning to try this place for ages and ended up getting take away  I expected it to be at the higher end of thai take away places due to its online reviews but I was seriously mistaken  The quality was poor and the food was cold when I got it  I got battered veggies and they were soggy and stale tasting  Overall the whole thing was a massive disappointment  Never again 
R0137,"I had to give a star for food  ambiance etc to leave a review  However we never got to eat the food as the restaraunt did not reserve the table that we booked  

I used to eat here regularly and Im even enrolled in their loyalty program  I know its busy on a rugby weekend so I booked 7 days in advance  It was also my daughters first visit so a bit of an occasion  They RANG ME 2 days prior  13/9 at18:35  to confirm the booking  I also got a text requesting confirmation 24 hours prior and another confirmation text when I replied  After all this back and forth  there was NO DOUBT that they knew we were coming  and we knew they were expecting us  

On arrival  on time  they clearly had not reserved a table but didnt admit it  I saw the reservation sheet guys   I might have been less annoyed if theyd been honest  They left us waiting without giving a reason  There is a restaraunt upstairs separate from the other restaraunt  but we were not offered a table there  Instead  after waiting 10 minutes without explanation  the waiter passed us carrying an extra table out from the storeroom   put it almost in the shop area with a tablecloth and expected us to sit in an part of the room not normally used for eating  that was effectively a walkway from the restaraunt to the exit

At this point we had been treated sufficiently badly   including a rather rude female receptionist  that we decided to leave  I eventually  accidentally  found the owner who offered complimentary dinner   There wasnt much point since we didnt have a table anyway  we hadnt been offered a suitable alternative place to sit  and we were too upset by then to eat  

I am a season ticket holder with Leinster  so would have been there at least 14 more times over the winter as the restaraunt was a favorite of mine  but Ill be much more wary of going here now  Absolutely furious  No excuse for it  given that they rang me on my mobile to confirm  proving that this had nothing to do with the app "
R0137,I visited Thursday 1st Dec 16 at 8 30 I booked through web  when we arrived there was confusion about my booking so we were told to take a seat in the cafe were we where pretty much left to our own  devices  our server arrived to take our drinks order after about 20 mins and a further 20 mins after that to take our food order  and pretty much went down hill after that  as this was a very special occasion and now has been tainted by our experience on the night   On a  positive note it was very good value for money 
R0137,I was surprised how different it looked at night  beautiful ambience with thanks to bottled candles  It made the restaurant look like a romantic wine cellar  
R0137,Im sure there are much better pizza places in Dublin 
R0137,Ive had my fill of poke bowls  �and these were by far the worst and the smallest  The tuna in my husbands ahi poke didnt taste fresh  The nori in the salmon bowl I built was so stale that it was hard and inedible  �We both had ponzu sauce  and it was so salty and tasted nothing like what its supposed to  I tried to drain out as much of it as I could  The one good thing was the salmon  �It was fresh and there was a fairly generous amount of it  Needless to say  we wont be back  At least not for poke 
R0137,"Impeccable service from the amazing hostess to our server  Amanda   

Sitting in the quiet wine room was lovely   Our food was excellent "
R0137,It was my husbands birthday but we were the only people in the cafe   it was a Saturday night at 8 30 and we were the only people there so zero ambience   food gorgeous but no pink gin Normally love this place
R0137,"Its OK  

The quality of the bread was poor   possibly frozen as mine was soggy underneath  So either frozen or they spilled something on it  �The mozzarella was like rubber 

For two sandwiches and 2 small coffees the bill came to  Euro 17 50  For that I would expect a bit of a side salad or something 

Coffee was good so it gets two stars  �Wouldnt go back for food tho"
R0137,"Left standing at door after we gave our names not sure what to do  We were therfore in everyones way coming in the door  People who came in after us did not give their names but went straight upstairs to their tables I presume 
Very poor service  at least 45 minutes before we had our drinks  Service of food was good when it eventually started 
Way too noisy  Christine Rutledge"
R0137,Lovely relaxed surroundings 
R0137,Mixed up booking at their end  bad table then offered  cold and drafty  First choice of meal not available  Overall ok experience but disappointed given recommendation of friends
R0137,"Poor ambience and limited menu  
Was superb restaurant years ago  Obviously not anymore "
R0137,"Really disappointing   Id heard from a number of friends that this place had gone downhill in recent months and I didnt want to believe it  but they werent exaggerating  Very average food; ""hand cut"" chips now mean french fries  and burnt french fries  at that  ; very slow service   we were hoping that the desserts would make amends for the poor main courses  but after a 20min want to ask for the dessert menu  we decided it was taking far too long so we just paid and left  I really dont think Ill be going back unless I hear that theyve returned to the great levels of food and service that gave them such a good name to begin with "
R0137,Really enjoyed our evening         I would highly recommend it       great dining experience         Staff exceptional 
R0137,Really good location close to Royal Dublin Show  Good value for quick meals 
R0137,The evening was very enjoyable  the staff were friendly and attentative and the food was delicious 
R0137,The food was good but the service that evening was not  Good atmosphere and local feel 
R0137,"The food was nice but the service was awful   I had to ask 4 different servers to bring us water and none of them did so I had to go to the bar to get it myself  

There were no condiments on the table and no waiters brought me any despite asking   Finally near the end of our meal I was given the condiments  

I would never go back here "
R0137,My friend ordered the vegan fish which was uncle bens rice and some crap out of a jar sauce  I will never be back here  Most of the food was simply not worth buying  do yourself a favor and stay home and cook something for a better experience 
R0137,very disappointing mainly due to the lack of atmosphere  We arrived at 8pm but but 8 30pm the restaurant was empty apart form our table of 7  It was the Friday before Christmas  The lack of atmosphere together with a chilly restaurant made it a dull experience  The management moved us to an table in the upstairs restaurant for our main course which was full of atmosphere  what you would expect  Id never book the Cafe again  Staff were pleasant
R0137,Waiter got the order wrong  delivered another order to our table  charged us the wrong prices   guess what  too high   and took forever to serve us  Very disappointing 
R0137,"We booked here for a family meal following my sons Graduation  I based my choice on my previous good experience of the Bistro upstairs but thought the more relaxed cafe was more appropriate for this occasion 
I was very underwhelmed by the whole thing  a less than warm greeting when we arrived  admittedly a very nice waitress to begin with but the server banged down plates several times and was less than gentle with glasses etc  Nobody collected the extra setting and glassware   as we were one person short   nor removed unused wine glasses from my sons who were clearly drinking beer  The candle  which had burnt down and out was not replaced when requested 
The food was lovely  but it only forms part of the whole dining experience 
Overall  the lack of attention to detail was disappointing for such a well known establishment "
R0137,We had a really nice meal at another place but it wasnt spoilt by the waiters who continually throughout our meal leaned over us to reach bottles of wine which were positioned awkwardly in a cabinet beside our table  We tried to ignore it and laugh off the annoyance but it got to much and so we mentioned it to the waiter who proceeded to not apologise and we were then given dirty looks by the other staff  Very unimpressed  They make us feel invisible 
R0137,We visited it with the friends and spent a great time there  Food was fantastic and live cooking show great 
R0137,WE WERE NEVER  ONCE ASKED IF EVERYTHING WAS OK  WE HAVE EATEN A FEW TIMES IN BISTRO UPSTAIRS AND FOUND IT VERY GOOD BUT WERE DISAPPOINTED  IN CAFE 
R0137,Went for early dinner on a Saturday  �Restaurant is not busy at all  Sat down at 5:30pm  Ordered an appetizer and a pizza  Dinner crowd starts coming in  place is getting busier  Big group sits down nearby as my appetizer comes out  They order  All of their pizza and drinks come out before my pizza comes  So I catch the waiters attention  who is already avoiding eye contact  on his way past to see what the deal is with my food as its pushing 6:20pm now  He says itll be another 20 minutes  �Does that make any sense  I paid for my app and left  This place is terrible  He didnt even have a manager come out to rectify a situation he clearly didnt understand how to handle 
R0137,What lets it down is the atmosphere  It shouldnt compete with the bistro based on the price but it could benefit from some charm of its own 
R0137,When we arrived we were brought through and up the stairs into the main restaurant   When we looked at the menu it was twice the price of the cafe and very busy and noisy   Fortunately  I had my email which I showed to the waiter and explained that we had booked the Cafe and not the Restaurant   After some discussion with the Manager we were told that the Cafe was very busy and we would probably have to wait for a table there   We pointed out that when we arrived there were tables free so we didnt see the problem   We were eventually escorted back to the Cafe where there were several free tables   We felt it was a little bit smart and I was very glad that I had booked online and could prove it with the email on my phone 
R0137,Bad service and ambience  Overall not such a good experince
R0138,This is the worst  Usually  I only get a bagel and tea or something for a quick bite in the morning  but on this visit I decided on the triple club sandwich  Luckily  I only ate half of it as I imagine I would have been sick the rest of the day if I had eaten the whole thing  On top of the low quality food  the service was even worse
R0138,Amazing food and drink  friendly and great staff and great service  A must eat place in Dublin  A lovely place
R0138,Amazing food  super friendly staff  great atmosphere  We loved it thanks for the perfect evening    
R0138,Amazing fresh italian food  Seafood is fresh and very tasty  As a foodie i am happy to return again
R0138,Avoid this takeaway like the plague worst customer service in my entire life female owner has a serious attitude problem
R0138,Awesome meal  I have come to expect great food every time  and  to date have never been disappointed 
R0138,Beautiful food but slightly expensive
R0138,Cute cafe for breakfast or lunch  I had the avocado toast with egg and it tasted amazing with a beautiful presentation 
R0138,Disappointed in the starter dishes of prawns and scallops  Not interesting and dry  The pasta with tomatoes and crab was very mediocre  The desert of fruits filled with gelato was quite DIVINE and very innovative 
R0138,Disappointed   Service so bad and rude  the dessert suppose to have ice cream on the side  and strawberry on top  but there is nothing until I said it supposed to have ice cream  He just realized that 
R0138,Dont arrive early   we were turned away as 15 mins early and nowhere to have a drink in there   We then returned  on time  and waited about 15 mins for our table and didnt receive our starters until 1 hr 5 mns later  from booking time of 9 30   Also expect to pay a lot for wine   its very overpriced
R0138,fabulous in every way   Food   service and setting were all perfect  
R0138,"Far too expensive for what it is  Wine list also way overpriced 
Food was good at best  but at this price point you should expect better "
R0138,First time dining experience and definitely will go back  Good variety of dishes and very tasty  Very good service and friendly staff 
R0138,Food was fine but slightly over cooked  and  it took way to long to be served  and  plated at 54 Euro 
R0138,Food was to die for  staff were very welcoming and nice  Would definitely recommend it to a friend and will definitely be back again 
R0138,Fresh fish selction is great
R0138,Great food  attentive and kind staff  nice atmosphere  good prices 
R0138,I know this is supposed to be a fish restaurant  but i cant help coming back for the truffle carbonaras 
R0138,I like trying different coffees around Dublin and  OMG  the Late and Scones from this place are amazing  Well done guys  keep the quality up
R0138,"I ve been waiting for a long time to dine here  so my expectations were probably high 
The whole dinner was disappointing 
The ""tonnarelli con astice"" were not tasty and they always come with a small piece of astice on the side  but not in Rosa Madre 
We paid 4 5 for a bottle of mineral water but the waiter served just 2 glasses and let us thirsty for the rest of the night  
We finally asked for an ""amaro"" that never arrived 
A recommendation for the owner:
Big prices dont make a big restaurant"
R0138,It is a nice restaurant but for small groups  definitely not for more than 5  the waiter did not have the best attitude with us  and some prices are excessive  especially  the wine 
R0138,Just great  Lovely time 
R0138,One of the best if not the best restaurant in Dublin  Great atmosphere  delicious food and huge selection of outstanding wine  Highly recommended  place where you need to be 
R0138,Our visit started off well  starters were tasty but then the over bearing service kicked in when plates were removed before we were all finished the first course  The bad service continued with a scowl when we refused to allow them top up our wine glasses  Two of our party chose one of the specials which was supposed to be crab linguiine  It la key any visible sign of crab or even a fish taste  When we complained the replacement dishes were almost exactly the same  When I had desert my plate was whisked away almost before I had put the spoon down after my last bite  Finally they started resetting the table as soon as we stood to put our Coates on 
R0138,Outstanding  Best restaurant in Dublin  highly recommend  Service  food  atmosphere all excellent 
R0138,Over priced specials that were only mediocre  As a single diner felt unwelcome 
R0138,Overpriced  food nothing special  Simple fresh fish could do better at home 
R0138,Service very slow  wine not chilled properly on opening   Music volume too high as speaker was located directly above table 
R0138,"The antipasti were a let down    we had the red sicilian prawns which was drenched in too much olive oil and cost  Euro 24  the octupus was not fresh as well 

Pastas wise the squid ink risotto was good and the truffle ravioli was not bad too "
R0138,The food and staff were nice enough  but the portions were small and the wine list was expensive  My partner and I pad  Euro 100 for starters  manis and a glass of wine each  which is well above our usual budget and I left the restaurant still hungry  It was a middling experience  and for the price tag wasnt worth it  It was a but disappointing if Im honest  but maybe the restaurant is more suited at people who dont really mind spending a lot of money 
R0138,"The restaurant looked amazing  Stylish waiters  nice jazzy music    a big window showed the kitchen  wood fired pizza    

The service was incompetent and rude  The rudeness could have been a reaction to our very polite critique of the wet  mushy  tasteless pizze we got  

Me and my Italian friend had big expectations and we were let down   big time  "
R0138,The service was indifferent and paInfully slow  They didnt have the wine I ordered so the waiter just brought something else  They were out of our first choice starter and we asked for a recommendation for an alternative and got a bland suggestion of something entirely different  The food was OK nothing special   The house special pasta with 1/2 lobster comes with tiny pieces of lobster buried in a red sauce  Tasty but not what youd expect from the menu description  Lots of better restaurants in Dublin 
R0138,The waitresses were lovely and the food was good  I like that there were loads of gluten free options  Great place  Highly recommend
R0138,The wine list is far too expensive  Nothing below 40e  Food was lovely and service good but overall think its an expensive night out 
R0138,"There is a management problem at this restaurant  The food is good  the whiskey list is great  and they do an adequate job with the beer  They do not operate the floor well  When I was there  three servers ran the entire floor with no bus support  One of those servers was brand new and god bless her  tried her hardest  
It was not their fault they failed  Management needs to hire to properly bus and set tables so the servers can do their jobs well  It was a terrible experience with a very obvious solution "
R0138,There were five of us  We were initially disappointed that there was nothing to drink other than wine  The three that had pasta dishes were also disappointed that these all lacked any real flavour 
R0138,"Too expensive for what you get  no early bird menu 
The food is not as good as expected "
R0138,Tuna carpaccio was not seasoned  but good quality  the carbonara was too salty and the pasta genuinely under cooked  Disappointing food experience but very nice and friendly service 
R0138,Unpredictable bill if you order one of their whole fresh fish meals  to share   Paid over  Euro 200 for 3 starters and one large fish to share and one  Euro 46 bottle of wine
R0138,Unreal   It was savage  Staff were brill and the food was excellent  
R0138,Very good food  professional staff  and nice surroundings  looking forward to returning
R0138,"Very pleasant staff  Knowledgable and courteous  
Food was good  as always "
R0138,"Was curious to try this restaurant as Id lived in Italy for number of years  This is not a level of authentic Italian cuisine that would be acceptable in a very average trattoria in Italy  The melanzane alla parmigiana was bland  Saltimbocca was chewy and cicoria a pool of green slime that had clearly been frozen despite being told that it had been imported fresh  
The cheapest bottle of red wine on the list  Primitivo at  Euro 31 was unavailable so we chose a Negromaro at  Euro 39 which was fine but in general the wine list is very overpriced  I can see no merit in returning there "
R0138,"Was recommended to visit by an Italian friend that supplies the Restaurant with wine 
We were greeted and brought to a nice table l  It was very busy and the service was under pressure m  No visit from a manager to see how our meal was going just goodbye as we left  so what if it wasnt that nice  Do we need to get up and look for a manager  I mentioned that it was our anniversary but that made difference either  
I usually return to a restaurant when the service and hospitality is exceptional but this experience gave me no love or care whether me we were there:
Perhaps became se it is in the city this doesnt matter 
Nice waiter from Sardinia but heavily under pressure
Great wine list  Nice food but just a little cold on the personality "
R0138,We had eaten here on one occasion before and thoroughly enjoyed the experience  This time round we did not enjoy it and will not be returning  We were 5  My daughters starter of mussels were cold  My sons starter portion of carbonara was cold  The scallops in a shell were smothered in far too much breadcrumbs  My sons  main course of lamb cutlets were inedible  They were fatty   gigot chops for which we werent charged  My husbands veal had too much flour on it  Both my daughters had the gnocchi  Very average  My main course of sole was the only decent main   Our bill was  Euro 400 to include one bottle of wine and 3 pre lunch drinks  We wont be back
R0138,We had 4 options on the menu including their specialty  My wife and I loved it The monkfish was perfect 
R0138,Our server was accommodating our experience was a great one 
R0138,We went for the second time to this restaurant especially chosen by my husband to celebrate his birthday  We booked 2 weeks in advance and were already looking forward to the dinner    as soon as we arrived they told us that the table was not available yet and they will have it ready in a couple of minutes    that couple of minutes turned into 20 minutes    and above all the staff  especially the guy at the cashdesk  was really rude  they didnt even offer us at least a glass of prosecco for waiting  so things didnt start great  After that we finally got to sit and ordered 2 spaghetti with clams and 2 octopus appetizers + a bottle of white wine     very poor quantity  60 grams of pasta  and food was ok but nothing exceptional  good wine but crazy price  the only positive thing   all the waiters were very kind  fuerthermore we were expecting at least a digestive or a glass of prosecco as it was told in advance it was a pecial occasion  The bill was crazy  and we were still hungry  + 70 euros each   We wont return there any more   
R0139,Excellent venue  Staff so nice and friendly  Food amazing  
R0140,Great food great venue
R0140,Very good food  Great service  Thoroughly enjoyable
R0140,"+ food  meat  served very originally on boiling hot stones
  ""guests own responsibility"" to cook the steak to the right taste
  tables in the restaurant are very close to each other  so you always have the feeling ""sitting together with your left and/or right table guests on the same table
  the acoustik in the restaurant is terrible   it is very loud and as a consequence you have to raise your own voice in order to talk to your opposite sitting companion
  the light in the restaurant is too bright   this prevents an comfy and cosy feeling  rather you feel like being presented in a showroom
+/  prices are fair and matching the quality of food/service"
R0140,4 friends for dinner   3 had steak and 1 fish   all came with hot stone cooking  All the sides were pickled with salt and needed to be sent back  The steak quality was extremely poor i e  cheap supermarket grade and not deserving of a 36 euro price tag  The manager tried desperately to rectify matters but the kitchen and ingredients quality were extremely poor  To be avoided to be honest
R0140,3 words  Amazing amazing amazing  Id go back tonight if I was asked 
R0140,"A bit disappointed  There was a draught from the front door  
We all had the lunch special  
There was no cauliflower  
Salted cod was  a bit tough 

Salmon was not very substantial  And was in a wooden bowl  
The minced pork pasta was too sweet  
We were then moved from our table to make way for next sitting  We then moved upstairs  And then were told we would have to vacate that table at 7 00
I cant understand how you can turn away business  
We spent a fortune for a not so great experience  
Shame "
R0140,A bit disappointing this time  We were a bit early  1/2 Hr  and that seemed to be a nuisance  even though it wasnt busy  On a voucher  so it was a very limited menu  Just didnt have the polish that previous visits have had 
R0140,A great night out celebrating my wifes birthday with stone dinners 
R0140,"A little bit disappointed as we were really rushed  Our table was booked for 5 30 and we knew the table was rebooked again for 7 30  That was fine but we had all three courses out by 6 30  I really felt rushed and there was no anticipation about the next course  
Also  our waiter didnt explain any of the menu or food when it came to the table  I looked at the a la carte menu and I would much rather it than the set menu  if I ever come back I wouldnt go when it is a set menu "
R0140,"A lovely experience and will definitely be back  

See my private note"
R0140,A most enjoyable experience in every way  Great company great food and excellent service
R0140,"A nice little coffee shop very cozy 

Perfect to sit  either inside and outside and watch the city stroll before you "
R0140,A very casual dining experience for which you are paying formal prices for  The waiter was disinterested  knew nothing about the wines  couldnt tell me what the sauces were with the steak  and to top it off he walked by cursing about a fellow waiter  We had to ask for a finger bowl    And then ask for more napkins    Just not good enough for  Euro 30 for a steak with sides as extras  The table beside us summed it up when asked if they would like dessert and responded we do but just not here 
R0140,Absolutely fantastic food and very helpful and attentive staff  There was an extensive wine list and our waiter advised us to suit our tastes  The only flaw we found was that it was too hot  We were sitting downstairs so next time well ask for a table upstairs where its more airy 
R0140,Absolutely fantastic food and very helpful and attentive staff  There was an extensive wine list and our waiter advised us to suit our tastes  The only flaw we found was that it was too hot  We were sitting downstairs so next time well ask for a table upstairs where its more airy 
R0140,Absolutely fantastic food with great menu options 
R0140,Absolutely fantastic food and service
R0140,Absolutely perfect experience  From entree to dessert 
R0140,After 3 calls confiring the booking and increasing the numbers in attedance whilst reconfirming the need for 1 high chair   the table was still not set up for a highchair   The food was good  but not great or special  and certainly not experimental or creative regarding delicious healthy options as advertised   Service was poor for the price point of the restaurant  The air conditioning started to leak over our table  we were moved  it wasnt a problem  but the handling of the situation could have been more professionally handled  Welcome was poor and stressed   Have eaten in superior restaurants of similar style and prucepoints in Dublin and wouldnt return to this restaurant 
R0140,Absolutely wonderful meal  The raw board was amazing and the superfood salad delicious 
R0140,After being here many times before  I was extremely disappointed with food quality  and service  My friends were visiting Ireland for the 1st time and Ive decided to bring them to the place I know  Food quality unfortunately  dropped and after mentioning all our concerns to staff they didnt bother at all    I was very upset with overall experience and I wont come back and neither recommend this place to anyone 
R0140,One word not good food experience
R0140,All four of us ordered burgers  We could see them on the counter for a good while before we got them  They were small  dry not very hot and flavorless  Not good value for  Euro 18  Very disappointed as I had heard good things and was expecting a lot better 
R0140,Always annoying when bill arrives and wine is overcharged  not much of an apology
R0140,Always Fantastic   great steaks and wines and good atmosphere   recommended
R0140,"Ambiance was poor
Squashed seating
Better deserts on masterchef   brioche was just a cup of custard
Malbec at 10e a glass was flat no zest
Not a top restaurant by any standards very let down"
R0140,Amazing as ever  the food is so tasty and full of flavour 
R0140,Amazing culinary experience  It was great to eat/cook fish on the stone
R0140,"Amazing food  and  very leisurely lunch spent with friends 
Highly recommend "
R0140,Amazing food  a bit expensive  Good service  but too loud inside the restaurant
R0140,Amazing food  cocktails and excellent service in fab surroundings
R0140,Amazing food   Great experience
R0140,Amazing lovely place lovely atmosphere great people I will come back again soon with my friends I will get back to you
R0140,Amazing place  All the food I tasted was great and the service was excellent  Will definitely come more often  You can never get tired of russian food 
R0140,an incident re greeting protocol resulted in having to prompt the staff member involved to  recognise and apologise which indicated very poor customer skills  and awareness of how it reflected very badly on the Restaurent   We certainly will never returning nor would we be responsible in recommending it to anyone 
R0140,Arrived just before 8 pm for our booking on a Saturday night  Ordered shortly after and starters  which in fairness were very good  arrived in good time  However it all went downhill from there  we were then left waiting  along with the two tables next to us  for about 80 mins  9 40pm  before our mains finally arrived  Having sat at 8pm this was a ridiculous amount of time to be left waiting  it was not a big group either  just two of us  Nobody came over to explain the delay up until just before food eventually arrived  and then they basically just blamed the kitchen  When the food did arrive we found it just   bland  My wife had a pasta dish which was nothing special  I had the 12oz sirloin which again I could only describe as ok  nothing special  Furthermore it cost  Euro 36  this for a steak on the stone which did not include any sides apart from the relish and sauce  Once wed finished we decided against any dessert as the whole experience had been so disappointing  On leaving we stated our disappointment and the waiter apologised but it seemed half hearted  again just blamed the kitchen and there was no offer of goodwill complimentary drink/dessert or discount which may have been a nice gesture  We were not the only ones either as there was also a table of roughly 8 beside us who were complaining to the manager for a long period of time  Very very disappointing  expected much more  Wont recommend and wont be back 
R0140,Very very disappointing  expected much more  Wont recommend and wont be back 
R0140,"Arrived st 820 5 mins after reservation 
Sat at table quickly we were given the wrong menus  a special offer  but we were not allowed to order off it someone came take order 35 mins after we sat down and our drinks order 
Disappointed as there was no glam burgers left on menu its a shame I think the place is nothing like it was was it first opened"
R0140,As always the food was amazing and the hospitality and welcome was top class
R0140,Average dinner  the place had gone down since a year ago
R0140,Attentive staff with good menu knowledge and were able to pair suitable wines for each course
R0140,Average food that is over priced   Poor menu  Would not recommend
R0140,Awesome experience  Great food 
R0140,Awesome food and atmosphere   Loved it  
R0140,awesome food  great quality and super service  Thanks guys 
R0140,Be prepared to smell like grilled meat for several hours after you visit this hectic dining venue   Its full of tourists and has the ambiance of a childrens playground 
R0140,"Beautiful Food and Great service 
Easy to find the location"
R0140,Beautiful Meal  well worth a visit  One of the best meals I have ever had 
R0140,Been here a number of times and enjoyed every time  My brother in law order the bread with dips there was so much bread and not enough dips  My sirloin steak was all fatty the stone wasnt hot enough as it stopped cooking the steak  Wasnt good value we all thought very disappointed for what we paid 
R0140,Wasnt good value we all thought very disappointed for what we paid 
R0140,Below average cocktails
R0140,Best meal I had during my entire visit to Ireland  Davor was a great server and a very sweet guy 
R0140,Birthday Party 
R0140,Bizarre  Just totally bizarre  
R0140,Bland  overpriced food in a restaurant that doesnt have to work hard to get bums on seats  The hot stone brought to your table to cook the food is a total gimmick 
R0140,"Booked a table for my husband and I  for early evening  
After being seated we had to wait a long time to get our menus  then for our order to be taken  During our meal  i asked to look at the wine list again  nobody came back to take the wine order and it was impossible to get any waiters attention  
The food choice is quite limited  Ordered chicken wings for starters   very tasty but a very small portion  Burgers for the main course were delicious  The food  although limited in choice  is very tasty but the service is very poor "
R0140,Booked a table for two on Thursday early afternoon for Saturday night  arrived on Saturday and our table was beside the toilet and beside the drinks bar which was very noisy as waiting staff were drying and putting away cutlery  When booking the table there were numerous times to choose from so I thought we would have a decent table  We werent a walk in reservation and had planned a nice evening  We ate our food and got out of there as quickly as possible as we couldnt have a drink in peace 
R0140,Brilliant food  very quick service  friendly and so accommodating 
R0140,cannot believe the amount of good reviews this place got  Seriously  the quality of the food was really bad  I hate complaining and as a rule  never do but I couldnt have it on my conscience not to warn other people before spending their hard earned cash  We waited for one hour for the starter  my partners never arrived  when I asked the waiter to bring it out  he snapped �Im doing my best  I have other tables�  when he came back with the starter he threw it on the table  The crab starter was tasteless with bits of shell in it  The waiters were running around throwing their hands up in the air and giving out to each other as they were pointing to a computer with the orders on it  They were over staffed but still not a bit organized  The burgers were raw in the middle and had obviously been sitting under lamps for ages  we only got to eat them after being there an hour and a half  tiny portions  polenta chips  Dont know what they were but they were horrible  
R0140,Spent a fortune on the awful experience  tried not to let it ruin the rest of the evening aSeriously   dont waste your time or money 
R0140,Clean healthy food in outstanding environment  The service was outstanding and reasonable price 
R0140,The service was excellent  menu was great  but unfortunately the food was lacking Disappointed
R0140,Decent food  creative way to serve  but the service was horrible  Our server would walk away if we didnt respond quickly and not return   Then he did not serve one person their app and later served the wrong entree yo another and demanded he ordered this really  tuna sounds like beef     Apparently some training is needed 
R0140,Delicious food  friendly service and great atmosphere  One of our favourite places in town 
R0140,Disappointed in this restaurant  4 of us had steaks for 3 of us they were tough  Whether this was due to cooking on stone is hard to know  I didnt like the hot stone experience  the meat was spitting  and  the steam gave me a facial I didnt want  Different way to eat but not for me  and  expensive for what it was 
R0140,disappointed on this visit as it was very hot downstairs  unbareable heat and too busy   the service was also poor to previous visits   Steaks also took a while to cook on the hot stones   May think twice about booking again 
R0140,"Disappointed with food steak was cooked again its arrived at the table no need for stone which was part of the experience the tables are so close together you can hear conversations and people eating 
Not worth the money"
R0140,Disappointed with the food  got the sirloin steak on the stone and have had much better in less expensive restaurants  Crab starter was tasteless  Not much of a dining experience  Staff friendly and service ok 
R0140,Disappointed   Food was ok but noting special  Service was awful  Staff were rude  the meal felt rushed and like they just wanted to rush us through the meal and get us out  Wouldnt visit again
R0140,Disappointing food
R0140,Disappointing menu   Pasta dishes were luke warm at best   Venue very smokey due to cooking at  other guests tables  Spillages  by waiter on the table were not cleaned   Had high expectations from looking at reviews but would not return
R0140,Disappointing  starter of bread was basic at best  Main course of lamb shank pasta was ok but nothing amazing  For the money it costs   not very impressed 
R0140,Do not seat downstairs  awful  Service was very good  both waiter and manager
R0140,Downstairs is far too hot  Had to leave early as it was really uncomfortable  The Restaurant really needs full air con particularly since you have hot stones in front of you  Expensive meal  Very uncomfortable dining  Service not great as for our drinks order was wrong 3 times  Many better experiences in Dublin at a much better price 
R0140,"Early bird dinner however pre theater meals are not offered on Friday/Saturday  

Pros: Ambiance was great and so was service  Very well done cocktails  

Cons: The food required the customer to cook their steak and fish  Its a niche of the restaurant which makes it ""rustic"" and ""on the stone""  Its great idea but terrible in practice  For the price of the dinner  no sides included   I had to endure cooking my own steak and getting grease flung at my hands and face; being stuck at a small table for two tabletop there wasnt enough room  and I felt I couldnt relax and enjoy my meal  Moreover  I felt pressured to rush to keep cooking the steak and consuming at faster pace for the meat to cook and not get cold  

I had zero interest in smelling like I bbq first the first thing on my Friday evening  Unfortunately  the only meat items that were not on the stone was a burger  


Value was fair to poor  Wouldnt return  and couldnt recommend *unless you want the experience 

It was however a great spot for pre dinner drinks "
R0140,Everything was simply outstanding
R0140,Everything was top class   Really enjoyed it   Would have no problem recommending to anyone
R0140,Excellant service by waitress Effie  Food  wine  and  cocktails delicious 
R0140,Excellenct
R0140,Excellent and very interesting menu  really helpful staff  my favourite restaurant in Dublin 
R0140,Excellent experience  Went for my partners birthday and the staff were wonderful
R0140,Excellent Food and Cocktails  Absolutely recommend the desserts 
R0140,Excellent food coupled with friendly  professional service  Quite expensive  but you will not be left hungry or wanting  Well worth experiencing once at the very least 
R0140,Excellent food very good service  Overall very enjoyable experience
R0140,Excellent food  great service   lovely ambiance  fabulous evening  
R0140,Excellent food  Nice and quick professional service provided by Adrian and other waiters 
R0140,Excellent place of you like the best steak in the world
R0140,Excellent restaurant with wide choice of well prepared dishes  Staff was great as well 
R0140,"Excellent service and delicious meat  Definitely recommend  
P S  Thank you guys for the birthday cake  best desert ever "
R0140,Excellent 
R0140,Expensive and not worth the money  Our waitress was lovely on the upside
R0140,Expensive for what is was  burger and chips    will give it a miss in future
R0140,Extremely overpriced for the experience  Many fine restaurants in Dublin which are better value  Locals appear to have cottoned on to this as diners were mostly tourists  No wow factor here  Pretentious and dull  Staff were friendly and efficient though
R0140,Extremely impressed  Chicken wings and tuna were absolutely amazing  Highly recommend this place 
R0140,Fantistic food   Super restaurant  lovely evening as always  
R0140,Fantastic experience from start to finish  Staff very attentive  Food was amazing  only wish I could have tried dessert but I was too full   Wholesome  full of flavour  delicious    highly recommend 
R0140,Fantastic food and ambience  steak on the stone was excellent
R0140,Fantastic food really lovely atmosphere and lots of fun loved it 
R0140,Fantastic food  with all courses being excellent
R0140,Fantastic meal and great value if you choose the �surprise� menu  Very highly recommend  and the service is attentive as can be 
R0140,Felt rushed by waiter she was bouncing around the restaurant  Food was not discibed well ordered the lentil salad but was not a salad at all but she did not correct me or help me navigate the menu
R0140,First time here  there was 4 of us and all of us agree that we had a good evening  food was ok but none of us would go back there 
R0140,First visit   disappointed to be honest the entire meal lasted 55 minutes and that was with a bottle of wine   Service was good but way too quick   starter of salmon didnt taste very nice and presentation was very poor and unattractive  The steaks were good but the orders were small and poor value   Overall the entire meal was very over priced for what it was and how rushed it was had a similar meal in Wilde in the Westbury the previous week for the same price  
R0140,Food fair but overpriced  Staff unfriendly and not helpful  Rib eye 30 e tasted like a bad sirloin  Will not return 
R0140,Food is amazing     
R0140,Food is good quality but very overpriced  Ordered two 8oz steaks to be cooked on a stone  Oddly one steak was much smaller than the other  It was OK  but  having read the reviews we were disappointed with the experience overall and wont be back  There are just too many other great restaurants in Dublin competing 
R0140,Food lovely  service very poor  Last two times we have gone  the service has been poor  I dont think Dylan would approve of it 
R0140,Food superb  Love the pasta dishes and chocolate desert soup
R0140,Food was fine but night was spoiled by a large noisy party next to us including speeches and shouting  I would recommend that parties such as this should be allocated a dedicated room  This was my first time to this restaurant and will probably not be back 
R0140,Food was lovely and service was really quick  Can not fault it at all
R0140,Food was mediocre  waitress was grumpy  sitting on top of people beside us 
R0140,Food was not great  Service was poor  I did not eat my mains as I found it to be unappetizing  The waiter did not approach us at any point to see how our food was so that I could send my food back  and  when cleaning our table he removed my full plate of food still without asking was everything ok with the food  Myself  and  my husband where there to celebrate a very special occasion so this was very disaapointing as I left the restaurant having no dinner  We did complain  and  the waiter apologised I would not go back this place is far superior with service  food menu  quality of food  and  value for money  I would not recommend
R0140,Food was ok  Got the melon bite and quail for starters  Melon was fine  quail under cooked  Got the steak on the stone as I wanted steak but I forgot they dont do cooked to order steak  It was grand but it is was to much of a fad to cook your own  Plenty if spots near but do a really good steak to order  I wont return 
R0140,Food was ok  It didnt say that the starter of prawns was to be cooked on a stone � I dont think Id have ordered them if Id have known  Steaks were nice  but side of polenta fries was swimming in some sort of mayo  which was not advised on the menu and meant I wouldnt eat them  Service wasnt great � we were ignored for a very long time before our order was taken  and again when we finished our mains  The price was quite high for the quality of food and service  I wouldnt return 
R0140,Food was ok   it didnt live up to the fuss   
R0140,Food was perfect  Service exceptional  Would definitely go back on my next visit to Dublin
R0140,Food was very average and over priced for the quality  My first fillet steak was marbled with fat which i gave back and it was replaced promptly  I didnt feel very relaxed  The food was rushed and the bill landed on our table before we requested it  I had been in this restaurant last year and had a lovely experience but this time i found the waiters very pushy to get us in and out as soon as  Iam sad to say i will not be recommending this restaurant 
R0140,Food was very good at this restaurant
R0140,For our 20th wedding anniversary we choose your Restaurant for our romantic evening  We had read many great reviews  My husband had requested a nice table  On our arrival we were informed our table was not ready  We were shown downstairs and waited for 40 minutes before been shown to our table  To our disappointment  the table was right inside the front door  We were sitting in the corridor  We asked to be moved  which your waiter kindly organized  It was unfortunate as this request was made in advance when our booking was made  The wine and starter we choose was not available also  Disappointing all round 
R0140,Found both the service and food excellent  Would highly recommend to all 
R0140,Freindly staff  great atmosphere  Food is bit pricy but high quality and taste great 
R0140,Full menu  large portions  great value for money and perfectly located in city centre with lots going on around it   Highly recommended   
R0140,Good food organic sourced and well matched  decent variety of vegetarian options  Very good service
R0140,Good food  nice place  The worst Service by a waiter I have ever had  Not helpful wrt to menu  wine  when we asked for water he replied with  Jesus as he walked away  No tip for him was my reply    
R0140,Good food  Good atmosphere  we had a great night  Highly recommend 
R0140,"Good for one off experience  
Staff seem very tired and in a rush  Lack of smiling  
The atmosphere is not relaxing honestly as the staff is running around looking very serious+ 2 hours is a time limit  for having a table "
R0140,Good offer on Monday and Tuesday great food for good price  be ideal if the offer was every evening 
R0140,Gorgeous food  fantastic service  unusual and amazing cocktails
R0140,Great atmosphere and staff very friendly  however our mains arrived before our starters so we ended up missing out on starters we really wanted to try  My husband had the mini burgers and they were cold when they arrived  In the end we were given deserts on the house but I did feel that the mix up could have been handled a lot better  no one really apologized  just said the starters hadnt been put on the system     We ate with friends and had a very enjoyable night and even a drink upstairs before but the mix up did impact the evening  The toilets all left a lot to be desired  I have no problem with unisex toilets but there were 3 for the whole restaurant  they were dirty and smell 
R0140,Great atmosphere  menu  service and food  Delicious 
R0140,Great dining experience and the best food in Dublin
R0140,Great food  and  service  Enjoyed the steak on the stone experience 
R0140,Great food and atmosphere   One of the best places in Dublin 
R0140,Great food and service cant fault it
R0140,Great food as always  however  we were on voucher  and our Waitress made us feel bad about that so it wasnt the usual great experience   the Guys are lovely  and the Manager and the food was excellent as always   but she really shouldnt waitress  as she clearly is unhappy with her job    If you have a voucher and are seated front right   be prepared to be made feel bad         
R0140,Great food but wine came too late  the bill was wrong and  the error not corrected or explained properly   Left a sour taste  
R0140,Great food excellent service good value would definitely recommend to friends and family
R0140,Great food  fab cocktails  excellent service and also great value

R0140,Great restaurant  with amazing food and excellent service  Highly recommended 
R0140,Great service   Very friendly and enthusiastic staff  Beautiful food well presented dishes  
R0140,"Great service and effort to get us our food in time for theatre booking 
Would highly recommend as a pre theatre spot for great quality food at a reasonable price "
R0140,Great service  Made sure we got out on time for theatre
R0140,Great steak  good atmosphere  service was just right  Enjoyed the experience 
R0140,great taste  a bit overpriced  Good quality overall 
R0140,great value with taste ie  3 courses were so tasty wine and cocktails were an added bonus
R0140,Great way to eat beef  if you dont mind a little extra work finishing the cooking at the table yourself 
R0140,Had a fantastic evening with friends on a night out in Dublin  The food was amazing  the staff was so helpful  I would highly recommend this place to anyone  
R0140,Had a very pleasant evening and will definitely be returning in the near future 
R0140,Had dinner with some friends on Saturday  to be honest it was an average meal   I ordered the Braised Beef with Truffle Tagliatelle   I have never in my life been served a dish of pasta with a hunk of beef on the plate  it just did not look right   The beef looked like it had fallen off someone else plate onto my plate  I could not believe my eyes when I saw the presentation  The beef on its own was delicious and very tender but would have been more suited to a rustic stew or served with potatoes and vegetables   The pasta again  on its own was very tasty but both togehter was a definite no from me   My friend orders the burget and got four polenta chips    Needless to say she was not too happy with the amount of chips she got  All in all the food was nice and tasty and service was good 
R0140,Had high expectations and was not dissapointed  will definitely be back
R0140,had the Christmas menu  Starters were pretty average  steaks were nice but desserts were very poor  It was fine but probably wouldnt return 
R0140,Have always loved this restaurant  however I felt this visit that that food and service werent of the quality expected  Very expensive meal for what we got  Wont be rushing back
R0140,Have been to this restaurant on a few occasions now and it never disappoints  Fab food  wine  and  service
R0140,Have dined here regularly and never fails to deliver great food and service   Would highly recommend it   Keep up the great work 
R0140,"Have eaten here many times over the years  Menu does not change much but the standard of the food has dropped alarmingly: 

Reheated  tough chicken wings that were only lukewarm 
Same as above for quail starter 
Semi stale bread with dips 
Soggy  lukewarm crab on toast 
Cold salt cod where The prosciutto has gone crispy from being left sitting out 

Main courses were ok apart from the truffle tagliatelle being very acidic and having no seasoning  and no discernible truffle flavor with the truffle fries 

Very poor overall  Dylan could do with sampling for himself as nowhere near the standard of before or the other two restaurants"
R0140,Haven eaten here before   on this occasion  unfortunately  the food was a little salty/overseasoned
R0140,We were looking forward to the this restaurant  However  it looked tired and lacked atmosphere perhaps because it was nearly empty at 1 30  The starters our group of four had were quite tasty but our mains of steaks were not great  We were overall disappointed  Like the philosophy on fresh local food but it just didnt deliver for us 
R0140,"Having had lunch on a previous occasion which was good  I was very disappointed with my recent dining experience   From the rather gruff lady who marched us to our seats  the tacky and dog eared menus we were given  to the 45 minute wait before receiving our food and wine  I was extremely disappointed   This was a special occasion  our wedding anniversary  and I felt that we were part of a conveyor belt system   The food was fairly ordinary  my wife is still recovering from the paltry 4 polenta chips served with the burger   I can assure you that she is not a big eater and was not looking for a ""feed"" but 4 chips is desultory   My sirloin on the stone could only be described as average   All in all  a big disappointment "
R0140,Heard a lot about this place but it failed to impress  The chicken salad was horrible and the rib eye steak was non descript  Tables are cramped together  I did not enjoy this restaurant  Its overpriced and the food is poor 
R0140,"Hi  we dined on Sunday evening  table booked for 6 45pm for 4 friends  
We arrived at 6 50 and were presented with the a la carte menus  
The hostess /  manager on the evening was very unwelcoming  seemed like we were inconveniencing her by just showing up  
After a few minutes we asked for the early bird menu  the hostess/ manager looked at her watch as if again we had asked for something unreasonable despite it being advertised until 7pm  
We spent some time looking at the menu and then a waitress came over and said we all had to order from the one menu  this would have helped to have been told from the start  
Anyway we all ordered from the a la carte in the end  service was grand and food was good  

The hostess / manager on the night seemed to be Having a very bad night  mumbling as she passed us on the stairs and in general didnt seem to want to be there  

Pity as I have been there a few times and always felt very welcome "
R0140,Horrendous  Nice friendly waiter  Waited for ages  main courses cane out separately and so did sides which were cold  Never again
R0140,Highly recommend  great food  great atmosphere  great staff 
R0140,Highly recommend  Actually is my favourite restaurant in town ;
R0140,Hot stone by the time our beef arrived  it was already well done
R0140,"I am a big fan of this place so I guess I had high expectations for this place but unfortunately it didnt  really deliver on taste  despite being good value overall    Menu options were limited on a voucher so opted for a bread and ""dips"" starter which came on a massive tray with lots of bread  2 bread sticks with a minuscule amount of ham on them  and 2 tiny bowls with some kind of an unidentifiable mousse   A typical case of style over substance unfortunately   Side dishes were good but my Glamburger wasnt great  the quality of the meat just not living up to standard which was very much in contrast with the steak on the stone that my partner had  which was really good   With only two choices of desserts  one being fruit  the highlight of the meal was the cocktail afterwards which we enjoyed in the bar upstairs   Good value  yes  Great food  not so much "
R0140,Overall I felt the quality of food was average  over priced and seating was terrible
R0140,I booked a table for two for a Friday night  The restaurant was very busy with a nice atmosphere  We were shown to a table which was wedged beside the wall  The starters was nice  I ordered cod wrapped in ham and my partner order Prawn Skewers   For the main I ordered  filet Steak on a stone and my partner ordered a standard burger  Thankfully we both didnt order the steak as the table was too small for one  I ended up pushed in beside the wall as this was the only space to put the plate  This was so uncomfortable that even if this was the best steak I have ever ate which to be honest was far from it the meal would be ruined by the fact I had no space to eat it  
R0140,"I booked a table online for 10pm  
I was called at approx 5 30pm to confirm the reservation  which I did  I was advised then last orders were at 10pm  I said that isnt acceptable as my reservation is for 10pm and we cannot order until we have arrived and looked at the menu  The hostess agreed and advised to call if we were running behind  I arrived at 10pm followed by the other guests  The front of house was on the phone and as I spoke to the waiter he cut across me and said the kitchen was closed  I made it clear I had a reservation and I was then rudely pointed to a table by the front of house  The waiters were pleasant through out except for taking dinner plates from the table before everyone was finished eating which isnt acceptable  If there is a problem with 10pm bookings being too late for staff perhaps you shouldnt offer this time "
R0140,"I couldnt hear my thoughts: very noisy and uncomfortable The meat was ok  the desserts terrible  we had to order some chocolate thing to ""erase"" the flavour of the ""fruit sushi"" "
R0140,I decided to bring my fiance here for her birthday as she is wheat and dairy intolerant and their menu caters for this really well  My fiance had salmon starter and there was something missing on the seasoning side in the dish  I had the crab starter which was really good but rather small  At this stage we were finding the restaurant chilly and noticed the front door was wide open  We asked the staff of they could close it but they said they couldnt due to fire alarm issue  Also my fiance asked for another drink which never arrived  I had fillet for main accompanied with the haut Medoc which was good but not the best steak I have had in a Dublin restaurant and pricey at  Euro 32 with no sides  Reminder on drink for my fiance  The tuna main was very good as it is really hard to get quality tuna in any restaurant in Dublin  The real problem at this stage was that we were absolutely frozen and miserable and were just eating as fast as we could  My fiance still never got that drink either  So we skipped dessert and coffees and that extra drink despite I had really wanted to try the desserts and give feedback  It is a pity we had a bad experience for a special occasion and felt the staff really didnt seem to care when we mentioned why  we had to leave before we had finished our meal  For that reason I would find it hard to recommend  this place 
R0140,"I didnt like it  First The waiters take The restaurant trash while we and some other people eat  I read this restaurant belong to someone who worked in Masterchef show    so i think The trash thing while diners are eating its not very polite  

To start asked for chicken wings  Too much wings but nothing of meat  

The meat in The stone didnt like  i dont know if its because i live in Argentina and Im used to eat really good meat but i feel this stone meat like bubble gum its impossible to chew

Im sorry i read this was one of The best restaurants in Dublin but I dont think so  And its overprice"
R0140,I dont mind paying premium price for a premium product  However the service  ambience and food was  at best  fair and very poor value for food 
R0140,"I found that people were not really nice to us  no smiling  you feel like you are annoying them    even if I know that is a hard job and you can be tired but still    
Dont expect big big quality on the food
"
R0140,"I found myself �here for about 10 minutes on Saturday  it was thronged and the music was blasting as apparently to have a late license in this town means you have to endure loud music and dark rooms 

There were some alcoves were couples sat  And various styles of music in each room  one of which was salsa and these amazing salsa dancers kept standing on my toes  They would not allow me walk by and didnt apologise  oh the joys of drunken obliviousness and numbness of the nervous system 

Upstairs looked nice but it was sectioned off  has that Professor Henry Higgins style library room to it 

Definitely somewhere to go with a group and maybe be a bit tipsy prior "
R0140,"I found the restaurant experience very disappointing to be honest
Also I did mention that it was girlfriends birthday and when I rand to confirm the booking the waiter promise for some form noting it by providing a cake/dessert with candles and writing her name in chocolate sauce   this didnt happened which I found disappointing "
R0140,I had high hopes for this Restraunt  but was left very disappointed  The menu choice was poor  the staffs attitude was poor and unhelpful  and the quality of the food was poor  I have never had a filet steak before that had so much grizzle on it   Euro 90 for two starters  two mains with sides  two desserts and two soft drinks  What a rip off 
R0140,"I had the worst cup of ""coffee"" here the other day  It was dirty dish water with foam on top  and called a cappuccino  �
The panini I had was dry and unexciting  The whole place just seems to be lack lustre  
"
R0140,I have dined in here many times over the years and it was one of my favourites   It was not a great experience this time  food wise  and therefore I will be unlikely to go again any time soon   The stones went cold very quickly and the remainder of our food was lukewarm  at best 
R0140,I have eaten here on numerous occasions and found it excellent  This time my fav starter chicken wings were soggy not the usual crispy pleasure of normal  The steak was also a bit below usual standard 
R0140,I have eaten there many times this visit was expensive and a bit disappointing  my steak was over seasoned and the lamb shank was just ok  Service was good and pleasant but 130 00 for an early bird is just too much for a couple dining
R0140,The steak was very chewy I did get rump which I know is not a great cut but it was very poor so it  shouldnt be on the menu And all 3 of us didnt finish our desserts unfortunately they where not nice at all The waitress did say the menu is going to be changed I might give it another go then 
R0140,I love the hot stone concept    Great wine list 
R0140,"I never leave reviews but I wasnt that impressed with rustic  I was there with my mum as we were celebrating wedding dress shopping  It was very cramped table and the waiter was fine  Nothing extra just fine  
I kinda expected more from the service  The food was fabulous I must say and when my mum commented that her fillet steak had fat through it  desserts were on the house  So that was nice  Shes have preferred a leaner fillet though  
Overall fine but nothing spectacular"
R0140,I organised this night for a reunion of friends  1 who traveled from Enniskillen and 1 from Belfast We WERE having a lovely evening and did enjoy the food and I was aware of the 2 hour table policy  After exactly the 2 hours was up despite us all paying an average of 80 euro a head and leaving a well deserved generous tip to our waiter we were ask to go upstairs to finish our drinks Our waiter had informed us that he had reserved a table for us upstair  When we went upstairs with our glasses of wine in hand we found curtesy of a very haughty waitress that this wasnt the case We were left standing like complete twats at the top of the stairs Up until this stage we had all being planning on a return tip We all found the attitude of some of the staff completely unprofessional as at one stage we were asked if we would like her to sack the waiter who had told us about the reserved table  To be honest this waiter was one of the most helpful waiters I have encountered and he definitely wasnt at fault imo  I found once we paid our bill it was bye bye   This whole experience has left a bitter taste in all our mouth and really spoiled the rest of our evening and I would be very reluctant to recommend this palce to anyone 
R0140,"I really loved the restaurant 4 years ago but now it was not the same again  We were sitting in the basement  the staff seemed to be understaffed  
The staff seemed to be interested in the beginning but was not paying attention to the guests after ordering and serving food  A service charge was included on the bill without mentioning on the menu or to us beforehand "
R0140,I should have checked the bill   I was charged for tea/coffee which I did not have and for the still water on the table  You can write this off as petty but it is sneaky and poor business  It leaves a sour taste and I wont bother coming back 
R0140,I thought the food was quite nice but we were squashed into a small table by a wall which was draughty and uncomfortable  Very disappointed by this as it somewhat ruined our meal and definitely impacted our impression of the restaurant  Given the food prices  I would have expected better 
R0140,I was a little bit disappointed that they do not have soy milk  I think any restaurant that claims to offer healthy food options should have alternative options for dairy 
R0140,I was a little disappointed with the service  I didnt feel very relaxed to be honest
R0140,I was concerned that it might be a fussy place  due to the specified table time restrictions noted online  but we opted for an early booking and selected the sharing menu for three  We were all well impressed with each dish we ordered  The starters were perfect  and the selection of cuts of meat on the hot stone were explained well and really delicious  Fabulous salads and desserts  Wonderful helpful staff  our waiter was kindly attentive but not intrusive  and great service and presentation  Good disabled access  Definitely will go back and explore the main menu  but for incredible value the sharing menu is highly recommended  Delightful experience  A great first visit 
R0140,I was disappointed with the choice on the menu   I had a voucher and was only able to choose from a particular menu that had limited vegetarian and pescatarian choice  Pasta as the only veggie choice   I dont come out to eat pasta  I can make that at home  One of my favourite side dishes  pea puree with broad beans and peas  was extremely salty  The room was extremely smoky due to the hot stone prawn dishes  but there was no ventilation to get rid of the smoke  Overall a disappointing experience this time
R0140,I was quite disappointed with my meal and my husband was too we both had fillet  steak  which was nice but sides very disappointing too much going on with swede n cauliflower etc cheese over sides have defo tasted nicer food quite decadent 
R0140,I wasnt happy with the way we where treated  We where there for 5pm on a Sunday   We asked to see the early bird menu and we where told there wasnt one  Even though I knew there was   A few minutes we where then brought the early bird menu by another staff memeber  Very annoying not being given it in the first place then lying about it
R0140,I work in the intercontinental and I always recommend And send guest for good steak   decided to take my friend as his a big fun Of steak     booked for 9 only got a table at 9:20  I understood but the worse the food took almost an hour waiting we had to ask as my guest was hungry   staff where friendly but the waiting was the worst I have ever experienced that let down the restaurant
R0140,"I would say it deserves more than 3 8 average rating
Its an expensive restaurant as you would expect  but overall a very nice experience that will not disappoint you "
R0140,"Im a regular visitor   I absolutely love the food  As always on my last visit the food was amazing but the service was awful  We waited 15 minutes before we were given menus   Tables were seated after us and got server ed before us  The waiter spilt the water all over the table and didnt clean it up  We had to ask for the wine list three times before we got it  Id understand if the restaurant was extremely busy but it was mid afternoon and about ten tables total  
I was so disappointed and its making me think twice about going again "
R0140,Ive been a few times and this time was just really disappointing  Probably wouldnt go again now as its not worth the money  Much better restaurants around for less
R0140,In fairness the staff were great  didnt pester you  unless you called them  and the meats were of a good size and cut  but thats about it  overcomplicated  and too much on the table for eating your food  when you have to cook it yourself on a rapidly cooling stone  If I had wanted to cook it myself I would have stayed at home  would like to venture back for the Raw menu though  unfortunately this is why we booked there  only to be told on arrival that it was more of a lunchtime think during the week 
R0140,"Impressive upon arrival 
Outstanding food with exceptional cocktails  Terrific vibe with a nice atmosphere  Highly recommend "
R0140,"it might have been the night  but we waited over 35 minutes before our booked table was ready and it took 15 minutes to finally get someone to run our credit card at the end of the evening 
Otherwise  staff very friendly and food prefect  Pity that the service was not better "
R0140,"It offers an extensive and accessible menu   by which I mean there are a wide number of options at different price points and suitable for all sorts of diets  The menu has been carefully designed with a nutritionist and caters for a range of dietry requirements  Dont let that put you off though  

The polenta chips were wonderful and covered in a mountain of Parmesan and Pink Pepper  the burgers juicy and piled high and the steak on a stone was a delicious piece of meat cooked to perfection every time  because you cook it yourself   Oddly however  the standout dish for me was a side order  Cauliflower isnt usually a vegetable Im especially keen on but the guys here do something magical to it that transform it into something extraordinary  

Service and the setting were perfect though my only complaint would be that the restaurant was filled with a few too many tables  That I guess is a side effect of sky high city rents  

A fantastic restaurant  a great experience   highly recommended when you are in Dublin  "
R0140,It was a great night and the food was fabulous  Id highly recommend this restaurant 
R0140,It was amazing    Best food and experience in Dublin 
R0140,It was Fantastic  My friend and I had a great time and a lovely dinner there
R0140,It was my first time to eat at this restaurant   it was empty at lunchtime on Friday when my friend  and  I went  although its a lovely restaurant with great service we were very disappointed with the tiny portions  and  very bad value even with a meal deal half price voucher  There are so many restaurants in the city that give way bigger portions  and  better value even at full price 
R0140,It was very difficult to get our waiters attention when we wanted more water  more wine  coffees and even to order drinks at the start of the meal  He was preoccupied with other tables all night  The food was disappointing and we had grizzly steaks which were ruined with mashed onions on top  The sides were of very poor quality 
R0140,"Its a while since weve visited and we used to really like this restaurant
overall its a bit tired  The menu and furniture could do with a make over  The fresh food and salads are good / very good  but some of the cooked food is poor  Salmon starter is not good  Not sure that steak on a stone is still the novelty it was
Sunday afternoon and the place was 75 percent empty   even so  the service was slow
we wont be going back"
R0140,Just a little too rushed to be pleasant  Without additional sides  mains have been disappointing 
R0140,"Just ordered a steak burger after my friend recommended it  I normally wouldnt order burgers from there as the meats terrible quality  The steak burgers over 7e tho and has the word ""steak"" in its name so I was expecting good quality meat  The whole delivery came to 21e  Not cheap  When my burger was delivered I was very very disappointed  It was 2 normal burger pattys stacked on top of each other  Two of the same cheap looking meat pattys that they use for their standard burger  That kind of 1980s Ireland cheap chipper meat that you wouldnt even find in a supermarket  7euro for that  I figured they ran out of steak burgers so sent me that instead  I rang them and they insisted they were steak burgers but smaller ones as they didnt have the standard one so sent me 2  If Im paying a lot for a STEAK burger then Im expecting quality meat  Not that cheap stuff  I wont be ordering from there again mainly due to them insisting it was a steak burger "
R0140,Lively place  great food but be warned very expensive  and  be careful of your drinks bill 
R0140,Loved the food and the staff  Great atmosphere  will definitely be back 
R0140,Loved this restaurant  Brought kids for special treat   they loved it too   Highly recommend  
R0140,"Lovely cakes but service v poor  Waiter appeared to forget order  When we mentioned  he just walked off and came back with one of the cakes in one hand  nothing in other and went to go  We reminded him of the second cake and he said ye  Came back later again with cake in one hand and cigarette tray in other 
Dont go to cafes much in Dublin but if thats classed as acceptable service Id be worried about what the tourists think "
R0140,Lovely experience excellent food  and great service
R0140,Lovely food and service staff friendly  lovely atmosphere  5 stars
R0140,"Lovely little cafe always busy anytime I went in  I
Highly recommended and very friendly staff  Great place for a pitstop "
R0140,Lovely meal here  Great atmosphere  friendly staff   lovely food and good value
R0140,Lovely place   food was good   Expensive when you have to add all your sides to the steak 
R0140,Lovely place really good food very friendly staff   see u next time�
R0140,Mediocre food and service for the price  Small portion sizes  Very dissapointed paying 18 euro for a small burger when Five Guys is across the road and is twice the size half the price  Polenta Chips absolutely tasteless  No substitutes allowed on menu you cant substitute rump steak for fillet etc which is extremely disappointing considering your paying 34 euro for a steak  Wouldnt recommend
R0140,Mediocre food and service for the price  Small portion sizes  Very dissapointed paying 18 euro for a small burger when other options available across the road and is twice the size half the price  Polenta Chips absolutely tasteless  No substitutes allowed on menu you cant substitute rump steak for fillet etc which is extremely disappointing considering your paying 34 euro for a steak  Wouldnt recommend
R0140,Mediocre food  poor service 
R0140,More like a hostel than a hotel  this place is super dirty  and the staff is unfriendly and unhelpful 
R0140,Much ado about nothing   Had heard alot about the this restaurant but it was poor   Mutton dressed as lamb really 
R0140,"My date ordered the house wine and we opted for a few tapas and this is where the ""meh"" begins "
R0140,"My friend and I decided to drop in for a 10 am brunch  We ordered the eggs benedict and it was quite possibly the worst version of that meal that Ive ever had  

The eggs were poached but were cooked so thoroughly that the yolk had become hardened  The hollandaise sauce had absolutely no taste and more than 90 percent of it had dripped onto the plate  The eggs were placed on a slice of toast that tasted like American wonder bread  The ham was the kind of thin sliced  square deli ham that you buy in packs from SuperValu for 2 euros each  The spinach was covered in grease  There was absolutely no flavor  

Im a college student and Im definitely not picky about my food  But this meal was so gross that I couldnt even eat it  even with my low standards for food and all  Maybe this place is only really known for its lunches and dinners  I dont know  I usually dont even write Yelp reviews  but having brunch here really inspired me to share my experience   "
R0140,"My husband and I decided to book somewhere different to celebrate our wedding anniversary so on friends recommendations we booked The this restaurant   

We were greeted by nice friendly staff at the door and seated straight away   We decided to order steak so we chose to share the bread and dips board for starters   which was gorgeous   We ordered steak on the stone   the steak was deliciously juicy  and  tasty   We ordered truffle chips   They were to die for   Amazing   

After dinner we decided to have a cocktail I ordered a luxury mojito it was delish   We were conscious that the restaurant was still very busy at 9 30 and thought the restaurant would be under pressure and want their table back   so when we asked our waiter for the bill  who was lovely and very pleasant without being intrusive  advised us that there was no rush on the table they didnt need it back   we were delighted and ordered more cocktails and enjoyed the rest of our night 

Overall a brilliant dining experience  and  highly recommended 
Worth splashing out for special occasions "
R0140,"My partner and I have dined here approximately 10 times now  We like the online booking and love the food 

Apart from the great meat and fish dishes  other particularly notables are the polenta chips and the cauliflower side dish  which we order every time  

So in summary  the food is delicious  Indeed weve tried most dishes by now  apart from the deserts  

However  for the last 3 visits  including the most recent one  we have had an issue with the standard of service  

On this most recent visit  we were greeted   shown to our table and handed menus promptly  However  we then had to wait for almost 10 minutes  and hail a different  waiter to place our order  We were then offered a choice of water to drink  which was spilled over the table and not dried up by the waitress  I dried up the spilled water myself and upon her return I requested a fresh napkin  only to be asked what was wrong with my  wet  one and told that I could have ""just taken one from the next table"" 

The food arrived promptly  as usual  and we were asked twice during the meal if the food was ok  which it was  

Another service issue occurred when we had to sit with dirty plates for 15 minutes afterwards  Eventually they were removed  after hailing another waiter ourselves   Rather than then being offered tea/desert  the waiter disappeared  

Thinks seemed even more ominous when a couple of middle aged North American tourists at the next table  obviously noticing our dismay  leaned over and commented that they too had found the service appalling 

After waiting for another 5 10 minutes  we gave up on tea/coffee  which was never offered  and hailed the ma�tre d for the bill  

Perhaps worst of all was that the bill was dropped over my shoulder  onto the table and she had to be called back and asked to return with the card payment device  

We left the restaurant bemused at the obvious disconnect between the standard of food and service "
R0140,My second time going there and was as impressed this time around as I was the last time  The ambience is just right  the staff so friendly and so helpful  The food apart from being delicious is presented with great taste  The freshness of the salads amazing  This is definitely one of my favourites in Dublin  Well done to everyone  I will highly recommend it 
R0140,"My sister and I were shocked to be served Vodka  and  Coke which was in actual fact Water  and  Coke as our pre dinner drink in the bar  After I informed the bar staff they did check the bottle and agreed it was not vodka but most probably water  I am horrified to know that an incident like this can occur in a top Dublin restaurant and hope this would NEVER happen again  

Yours sincerely "
R0140,Myself an my husband were here on sat night staff were very stand over us while eating i ordered a bottle of rose e wine the waiter just poured it with out asking if we liked it it was vino not wine i googled the bottle its cost 8 dollars a bottle u charged me 30 e a bottle
R0140,he ribeye was full of fat way over priced i hav eating on top resturants all over the world an this in my opionion is the worst iv ever eating in
R0140,Nearly  Euro 10 for a Knickerbocker Glory   Little or no choice for a Coeliac  I would have liked more than 4 Polenta Chips  I left the restaurant hungry 
R0140,Myself and the girlfriend had high expectations for the food here and they were surpassed  Certainly mine anyway  she wasnt too bad fond of her desert  but neither of us are mad about desert usually anyway  and we were both full after the main course too so that was a very minor letdown  Would highly recommend to others  Also worth mentioning  I had ordered a beer that I was still waiting for 10 mins later   asked about it  didnt complain  just mentioned it to a passing member of staff   got it within 5 minutes AND wasnt charged for it  Outstanding experience 
R0140,Nice restaurant  great food  Service was fast and waiters are very friendly  As always steak on stone was superb  Highly recommend
R0140,Nice restaurant Little bit overpriced Food was lovely and good wine list 
R0140,No atmosphere whatever  I was taking my daughter for birthday treat    I was disappointed all round     
R0140,No  time between courses  Felt very rushed  Food was lovely though 
R0140,Not a good thing to be told what time you need to leave at before you even arrive  Also when we did get there  we were left alone for about 20 mins and had to ask for water and the wine menu  If you want people out within 2 hours  dont leave them sitting with no service
R0140,"not great  overhyped
Focus should be on the burger not the look
Service was not quick"
R0140,Not overly impressed  Wouldnt go back 
R0140,Not that impressed   I would rather have my steak cooked to order as opposed to having to cook it myself on the stone provided   Service was so so   Ambiance was so so    All in all  I thought this place  was much better 
R0140,Not the cleanest or tidiest place  Reasonably friendly  Very few local diners tell a story
R0140,Not Too expensive for what it was   good food  nice setting  Nothing amazing 
R0140,Not what was expected for the price  food was good but not amazing   Menus were frayed at the edges which shows how it hasnt been updated in a while and is not seasonal   At the price that was charged I would have expected to come away with a memorable experience   Yes cooking on a hot stone on your table is different  but not unforgettable   Wouldnt recommend it to a friend  wouldnt go back 
R0140,Nothing particularly special about this Restaurant  good food overpriced 
R0140,On a recent trip to Ireland  this was one of the restaurants I was most looking forward to visiting  and it ended up being one of the disappointments of the trip  We were stuck downstairs in the corner under the air conditioning  which was chilly the entire meal  The restaurant concept seemed novel  but ultimately came off feeling gimmicky  as the food was roundly underseasoned  mains/meats  sides  and all  For the price point  I would definitely go elsewhere 
R0140,"On the plus side    Salads  Non alcoholic cocktails  side dishes and desserts were fab 

On the minus side   Breads served with dips were not fresh  a cold wind blew through the door every time it was opened  the smell in the unisex toilets was disgusting "
R0140,One churlish waiter tainted my review  Felt very rushed in the restaurant
R0140,One of a kind  Love the on the stone dishes  Keep it up 
R0140,One of my party was vegan very limited options  She ordered 2 sides of Mushroom  and  polenta which was very poor 
R0140,One of the best meals I have ever had  amazing food  Definetly will be back as soon as I can    
R0140,One of the best restaurants in town 
R0140,One of the worst places ever visited  service was unbelievably bad  Never seen staff with so poor manners
R0140,Ordered a steak on the stone  my first was overdone  my second was much smaller than my original  It was overpriced and could have benefited from a sauced   Euro 35 for a sirloin steak and didnt even get a side  Service was mediocre at best and toilets were revolting 
R0140,No repeat business  of that I am sure 
R0140,Ordered Steaks   Overall they were average   not good value for money  Would have expected something special for the price charged    Starters were tasty   kids enjoyed these also   Service was reasonable although took a while to get order taken  
R0140,Our hotel concierge recommended this restaurant for our last night in Dublin  and we were delighted with all aspects  The service was friendly and attentive  The atmosphere was modern and lovely  The food combinations were as creative  and delicious  as any we had experienced  Highly recommended 
R0140,Our other food order was forgettable 
R0140,"Our pizza dough was uncooked  our ""salad"" was iceberg lettuce with some coleslaw and our fries were greasy and tough  "
R0140,Our seat was opposite a service door we had booked in good time and requested a different seat which was basically ignored by the host who was very blunt didnt even greet us  there were plenty of tables around us free the whole time we were there  My food was very good but my wifes steak was very fatty  Dont think Id go back  Ive been to much better bistros
R0140,Outstanding food at a great price and staff were very helpfully and friendly 
R0140,Over priced steak in the stone which was only ok  not great flavour and not very tender
R0140,Over rated restaurant  I thought the food was average and my beer was flat 
R0140,Overall very pleasant friendly staff  very attentive  food amazing  good atmosphere
R0140,"Overall  it was a very disappointing experience  Server was rude and uninterested  The food was so lackluster that we left feeling totally unsatisfied with our experience  This restaurant is not a good value for money  You can get a much more satisfying and tasty dinner at most pubs or nondescript restaurants in the area  The burger was tasteless  we had one earlier in the weekend for half the price that was much better   The burger comes with 4 chips   seriously  4  Yes  We stupidly ordered the ""super food salad"" which sounded healthy and interesting but came as an ice cold mass of greens with a minuscule piece of haddock and had no quinoa to speak of as advertised  The avocado was rock hard and not ripe  A waste of money "
R0140,Overpriced food and a lot of people put into one restaurant  staff were very professional and polite also very accommodating     Three toilets for the whole restraunt unisex    Unfortunately I would not return or recommend   
R0140,"Overpriced pretentitious food   small portions and stressed service 
Sitting at a diner style table that was very narrow and short The hot stones the food comes on could hardly fit on the table of four   Waitress ignored comments that table was small and food too salty Small cocktails but interesting ones 
Feels more like you are having tapas priced at main course prices   Have been here twice before when it opened up but sadly found the wow factor is gone "
R0140,Perfect birthday dinner during a weekend in Dublin   fantastic service and food
R0140,Pleasant service  quirky menu  menu descriptions dont really match when the food is delivered but it tasted good so it wasnt a bother 
R0140,once was enough; dont feel a need or desire to return 
R0140,Poor excuse for a buffet or Chinese food  Most food was quite dry and bland  Quite disappointed 
R0140,Poor menu options  poor vegetarian options   and the main hot veggie dinner was out of stock   early evening on a Saturday  Cramped spaces  noisy ambiance  Errors made by waiters who we felt were not paying proper attention  Expensive food options which really does not fit the ambiance  We expected fine dining but this is not the style of place  The expensive steak on the stone was good and the cook yourself idea interesting  but to have to pay for a side on top of this goes back to the feeling that this is an expensive restaurant but doesnt deliver the experience well  Our waiter did cancel one item off the bill which was decent on their part but it did not recover the evening for us 
R0140,Poor vegan options  I ate olives as a starter and watermelon and rocket for dinner   that is not a meal 
R0140,Poor vegetarian selection  no vegan options on the menu 
R0140,Pretentious   Overpriced and fairly uninspired food  Noisy to start with and volume increased   Was interesting to check it out but wont be rushing to back or more than likely ever revisiting   Definitely a case of style over substance 
R0140,Raw board was great  Steak didnt work served on a hot stone sorry
R0140,Really beautiful meal  Very large portions  We found the wine to be very expensive
R0140,Really delicious meal  attentive staff and lovely ambience 
R0140,Really disappointed with quality of food   Both myself and my wife had different mains and we were seriously underwhelmed  Wont be back
R0140,Really good Irish breakfast in a central location with reasonable prices  Just what we needed  Thanks 
R0140,Recently had a meal here and I wasnt very impressed 
R0140,The service was terrible and slow and the waiter recommend a cut of steak for us to share that was 500g of just meat no fat or bone  that was a lie it was full of fat  Also the table we had was in the dungeon you barely get by the next table to go to the bathroom 
R0140,Steak was very expensive considering you have to cook it yourself  nothing is served with the steak so sides have to be ordered at an additional cost  We ordered chips and were very dissappointed to see 5 chunky wedges on skewers  Will definitely not be returning to or recommending this restaurant 
R0140,Recieved feedback from collegues  food was not of the standard expected 
R0140,Rediculously over priced 
R0140,Restaurant lacked atmosphere  myself and husband ordered the rolls Royce sirloin steak on the stone it was extremely tough and really lacked flavour  It was accompanied by creme fraiche and sweet onions which we didnt eat as they were horrible and didnt enhance the flavour   we got two sides of chips one with Parmesan and polenta chips again completely tasteless and we barely ate them as they just werent nice  Overall it was one of the worst meals we have ever had and will  not be reccomending to others in the future unfortunately
R0140,Room was nice and lively   a cool venue  Service was very good   menu explained well  Food was presented very well   however the heavy dishes were a problem   we saw a waiter drop a tray over a customer  Expected great food and it was good   but almost everything was too sweet  Portions were small and over priced   monkfish was lovely but very small for  Euro 34 with no sides  Steak was good but again too sweet  Worst experience was the wine   I had two glasses of house reserva rioja for  Euro 11 50 each  no other alcohol    and I had a massive hangover next day  A sure sign of an inferior wine  Glad we tried it but wouldnt go back   Euro 190 + service for two people is massive money for a meal that was good only in parts
R0140,Rude host   I would not go back  I would not recommend this place
R0140,This place was over priced  especially if you have to cook your own steak   there should be an option on the menu for a cooked steak of your choice also 
R0140,This place was recommended by a friend  It was less than average  The monkfish is awful  The cauliflower was excellent but couldnt come close to making up for everything else  We spent well over  150 00 and had a better meal at the local pub  VERY DISAPPOINTED  Would never go back or recommend to anyone 
R0140,Sadly it was a very disappointing experience  We were left waiting for over 45mins for desserts that never arrived  We asked 3 different waiters during this time and it never arrived  We had to leave as we couldnt wait any longer and had an appointment  We were given the voucher for our cocktails which we had to have another day but no desserts  I had bought an offer with a The Taste which included 3 courses  bottle of wine and cocktails  To have to leave without getting the full meal when it was already paid for  was frustrating and disappointing  Service sadly was lacking throughout the evening and the tables around us were saying the same as they were waiting for things also  When seated downstairs you feel completely forgotten about  not a good option  Wont be back soon 
R0140,Saw good reviews and decided to meet relatives here from Ireland    After a nice dinner  we were unexpectedly asked to leave because they needed the table    Our ice cream hadnt even melted from desert and we were not over staying out meal in any way   They really ruined what was a very nice evening until then 
R0140,Service was below average  I ordered a salad for a light lunch  I ended up with what looked like something I would take to a family bbq  All leaves and a few token pieces of parma ham  Wine was nice though 
R0140,Service was chaotic   food arrived at different times and very late   Salad arrived 10 mins after others mains   One meal   half arrived after we had finished eating   Staff were frazzled and unfriendly appeared under  too much pressure   Food was not of the standard we would have expected for the prices and the salad was particularly disappointing  arriving in what looked like a bucket   Very awkward to eat 
R0140,Service was chaotic  My friends were pained looking at me trying to manage it  It was mostly leaves and without anything to recommend it and I like salads   Very few gluten free options  It was too loud and noisy  we could not hold a conversation between 4 people seated close together and as we were seated near the kitchen smoke was getting in our eyes   We did point out the problems and were given complimentary desserts but the meal was a total disappointment as our Christmas outing which we look forward to each year 
R0140,Service was slow and drinks were given to wrong table  5 minutes later when the other table said to the waitress that they had not ordered the drinks  the waitress took the drinks and instead of giving them back to the bar she gave them to us  even though the Heineken had a few sips taken out of it 
R0140,"Waiter had to come to the table twice to change the order as he didnt know what steaks were already sold out 
Desserts had a cream tasting really sour  when questioned the waiter took the dishes away  3 waiters came to our table and said its actually yoghurt  Didnt ask if we wanted to order another dessert or anything  only said he spoke with the manager and they werent charging for them   I wonder if he really considered to charge for something that we didnt have 
I also had mentioned at booking stage that we were there celebrating birthdays  nothing was saved at our booking and after all disaster of the night  theres no mood for happy birthday  Not going back "
R0140,"Service was very pushy and slow some times  a raw board with cheese and ham  and bread took almost 30 minutes to be served  Drinks took quite long to be served as well 
Not pleasant ambience when everyone has hot stones with steaks  on their tables and the extractors are turned off  We left smelling like the meat and covered in grease "
R0140,Service was very slow  We were halfway through our meal by the time our drinks order was taken  Sides ordered didnt arrive until almost finished meal  Prices very high for quality of food  Thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant a few years ago but this time it felt dated and worn out
R0140,Service wasnt very good   The orders were mixed up and the waiter incorrectly distributed the food well done burger given to a medium request    The glam burgers were chewy and had weird hard bits inside   My daughter had to leave the table  as she lost her appetite   The waiter never took drink orders when we arrived and we had to ask specifically while ordering our meals   Had a good experience on our first visit  but we were disappointed this time 
R0140,Slightly overpriced  Worth a visit  Not a place I will be returning to 
R0140,Food was iffy  at best 
R0140,Sloppy and rude server  We were a bit late and the waiter actually scolded us 
R0140,Staff have serious attitude 
R0140,"We arrived 6 minutes late for our booking  having called the restaurant to tell them we would be slightly late and to check would that be a problem  The maitre d made a point of looking at her watch before bringing us to our table 

The tables are on top of each other  They have zero vegan options and are unwilling to accommodate  The waiter kindly informed me the menu we were given is the only one  

Long story short  we left after 10 minutes and will not be back  This place really needs to get over itself "
R0140,Staff very freindly  service was excellent  food delicious dont need anymore than that  thank you
R0140,Staff very friendly   Food was Great   cant wait to go back and try out the rest of the menu 
R0140,Staff were attentive  and  very pleasant  but I had to wear my coat inside because I was freezing  it was a very cold day   We had a hamburger  and  glamburger  the quality of the beef was poor  and  barely seasoned  almost tasteless  I didnt finish mine   The truffle mayo chunky chips were nice  paid extra for them  but there were only 4 polenta chips with the hamburger  rather miserly  Disappointing on the whole 
R0140,"Staff were great 
Not for me  The meat was probably of a high rate but I couldnt cut it to put it on the stone as was recommended  Might be an idea to cut it as per the advice to cook it  
Got chicken wings to start over fried and one finger bowl between 2  not nice  
Table up against a pilar so I had no elbow room "
R0140,Staff were very pleasant  The food is average and very pricy for the standard so overall represents poor value for money  Wouldnt be one to repeat in my book 
R0140,Standards have certainly dropped  Food quite bland we felt  Staff in particular on more than one occasion with multiple members were lax and clearly not interested in providing service  Looks like a lack of management 
R0140,Starter and mains lovely   however desserts were not nice and extremely overpriced 
R0140,Steak came out and was 90 percent fat  we both ate a small portion and then had to order a pasta dish between us  forgot our drinks and cutlery and we had to ask twice  Bill came to 145 for the two of us  terrible value for money would not recommend to anyone
R0140,"Steak on stone came out well done  full of grizzle and without the sauce mentioned on the menu  White wine was warm  Service was very good though and a member of my part was offered a free dessert 
Bill was also incorrect "
R0140,"Steak on the stone came out medium rare before getting the chance to cook on the stone  
Pickled onions as a side was poor enough 
The last bottle of water had a strange taste to it  Replaced without issue  Service was great though "
R0140,Steak on the stone and chicken wings amazing  Gorgeous New Zealand wine  My favourite restaurant 
R0140,"Steak was almost cooked through before it came to me and I prefer it medium rare 

Food was brilliant however 
Also the smell from all the cooking in the restaurant results in your clothes smelling like you were in a kitchen for the night but thats what you sign up for I guess"
R0140,Steak was incredible                              
R0140,Strange taste off fillet steak  Couldnt fault anything else 
R0140,Suggestion to the owners: train your waitstaff to be more attentive to detail  and  make sure all of your guests receive consistent quality in their dishes  especially when serving large groups or you run the risk of making some guests like myself feel ignored  and  cheated    
R0140,Superb food fantastic atmosphere highly recommend 
R0140,Supper nice staff and great food 
R0140,Tables too small for hot plates  Too expensive when meal not entirely cooked by a chef  Nice menu and fresh ingredients but overpriced 
R0140,"Take the pasta of the menu  awful  Had 2 dishes  cant say which one was worse    Ive eaten better at the Autogrill in Italy  Shockingly poor   Ps  Relax on the parmesan  you know you can serve it apart  we are adults  we can work a spoon 

Clearly a place to have only meat  which I had before  and was divine  but we cooked it   

Chicken wings nice and cocktails also  but you expect a lot more from Dylan     send someone to have a look every so often  keep an eye  Slipping "
R0140,tasty food but very expensive for what it is  restaurant needs to be updated a little as has looked the same for years and menu getting boring
R0140,Terrace is horrible   Ambience/service just everything  about it
R0140,Thank you for a wonderful memorable evening celebrating by birthday with my family
R0140,The concept is interesting  but the delivery was disappointing 
R0140,The concept of cooking on a hot stone is interesting  However  the execution doesnt really work  The food was sub par due to the stones 
R0140,The tables were very close together and the noise level was extremely high 
R0140,The evening we had dinner  it was very hot in the restaurant  The wine was not chilled and at  Euro 9  50 a glass it should be perfect  The food was nice and staff were polite and courteous 
R0140,"The food and resturant looked good  The food had terrific presentation but the quantities were small and not filling  We were cold  as there were ceiling hung fans blowing on either side of us  My starter  had no bread or bread stick served  I got polenta fingers but it wasnt enough for me  My husband was given advise twice  on how he could/should eat his steak  He said it was tender but had absolutely no jucieness  eventhough he likes it rare and cooked it to his liking on the stone  My burger was a mini  It was too tall to take a bite of  and the base bun was so hard and tough I couldnt get the knife and fork to work  
The downstaris is not at all like the upstairs  which had lots of atmosphere  No piped  music    just plain conversation and joviality "
R0140,The food and service is outstanding in this place  There is a great buzz in the restaurant 
R0140,The food delivers every time and never disappointments 
R0140,The food is average and not cheap  Steak is cooked by on a stone and mine was well done when I received it  ribeye   the fillet is a better choice as its thicker and isnt cooked as quick  Whole idea is a bit of a gimmick 
R0140,Poor and awkward waiting service  being interrupted and with them trying to pass by you with drinks from the bar 
R0140,The food is to die for  The White Russian is among the best  Everything is amazing
R0140,The food was amazing  We choose a lovely bottle of wine and had a great time
R0140,"The food was beautiful 
However  we were rushed out of the place 
Our waitress took away my dinner plate whilst my partner was still eating his food  
We were finishing off our drinks and were presented with the bill even though we did not request this  
We were constantly asked if we were finished during our meal and were given no time to relax and enjoy our food and drink 
I was left feeling very uncomfortable by the whole experience "
R0140,The food was decent in flavor and had a unique presentation 
R0140,The food was good and the concept of cooking your own dinner at the table is unique however the service is horrible   It was like a team of people worked to see who could be the most ambivalent towards their customers 
R0140,The food was good  Service excellent but definitely overpriced
R0140,The food was great here however the service was not to our taste  The staff are fine  obviously trained in customer service but still lacking in friendliness   The service was far too rushed  we had barely swallowed our starter when the main arrived and the same with dessert  Our water bottle was whipped away with no offer of a refill  Its a lovely restaurant but is just missing the customer care edge that we would expect from such a well known and well established restaurant 
R0140,The food was great  the service however was very poor  We order some starters that we never got and the service was very slow  At the end they offered us some free coffee and we ordered 3 but they brought 4  just one more mistake to add to the list 
R0140,The food was lovely  however   the table we had was so bad   we were squeezed right into a corner   the wall actually overlapped the table on my left side  If I had been left handed I wouldnt have been able to eat properly  We were so close to the table next to us we had to move the table for me to get in and out  I found the whole thing quite stressful  Would recommend for groups  so you get a bigger table  but not for couples 
R0140,The food was nice  tables  for 2  very close together for two quite uncomfortable to be honest  Felt we were rushed out for next sitting  Dont think I would return 
R0140,The food was overpriced for what we got  Have been here 3/4 times but wont go back  The service was really bad and some staff were rude which was disappointing 
R0140,The meal was far too rushed  Nibbles and starter came at the same time  Had indigestion after it   Disappointed
R0140,"The restaurant itself is badly laid out   overly cramped tables give a cafeteria style feel but at sky high prices  Its not a relaxing venue   The menu is *too* broad and has a scatter gun approach   better to do a few things and do them well 

Food is fine  but theres nicer experiences and better value to be had elsewhere in Dublin "
R0140,The only reason we went here was the present of a voucher  From the very first booking email the tone of conversation was overly pretentious   this is a restaurant trading only on its celebrities chefs status 
R0140,The only thing that I wasnt impressed with was the pitcher of Margaritas  Three small jugs that was supposed to fill four glasses each  but didnt because  some of the glasses are too big      For 35 euro per pitcher and little more than a half glass I was pretty disappointed  �
R0140,"The options for vegetarians and gf were very disappointing 
A gf pasta wasnt even available so quite disappointed overall"
R0140,"The reason I booked was due to their early bird menu but wasnt given it  I had to specifically ask for it after being given the regular one which set a bad tone  The place was empty when we arrived so when the table we were given was extremely wobbly we just moved up one table  As I was on a long couch I placed my bag beside me  The waiter came over and asked to take my bag as it would be ""in the way of other diners"" again there was nobody near me at all  I explained I would move it if anyone wished to sit on the couch  Requested coffee instead of desert 4 times  coffee never arrived  Upon leaving were given the wrong coats  When I went downstairs to use the bathroom I was sang at by the chef trying to get my attention/flirt highly inappropriate and then when I was going back up the stairs he was sitting looking at me as I went past  very uncomfortable  The toilets were not the nicest "
R0140,This place certainly didnt live up to expectation considering the prices they charge for both food and drink  There were 4 of us dining  we shared some starters which were perhaps the highlight of the evening   the raw board and chicken wings  The bottle of wine we ordered wasnt in stock and the wine we ended up ordering    Euro 48 euros a bottle   was nothing that stood out as memorable  We all had steaks for mains  Of the 4  the only one not overdone by the time they got to the table was the fillet due to its thickness  Mine  which I normally eat rare to medium was almost well done  All of the steaks were  Euro 30+ but didnt even come with one side of chips  All sides were extra  I think  Euro 6  Euro 7  which is ridiculous  The desserts were by far the worst course  We ordered the trifle and the sorbet   do not order these if you go  Totally overpriced and seriously underwhelming  I honestly dont know what Id recommend this restaurant for but I definitely wont be rushing back   certainly not if I was paying anyway  The espresso martinis at the end were pretty good though so at least it finished on a positive 
R0140,"The seating was a disgrace  We felt squashed and barely had any leg room  Felt like i was on a ryanair flight     with amazing food     
Apart from the food bill we had 2 irish coffees   1 x beer and one cocktail and the bill came to an additional 57 Euro      The bill was not itemized and the restaurant extremely busy therefore i  did not feel comfortable questioning it especially  in front of my guest   This has left a bad taste in my mouth if im honest   DO  think this is a shame as i was very impressed with the food and excellent presentation "
R0140,The service here was ok  a little bit slow but cant really fault our waiter who was smiley and attentive  The food was terrible  I had crab mayonnaise starter which looked like it had been prepared much earlier and had been on the pass for a long time as it had crusted over  My beef shin tagliatelle was tasty but I could honestly have easily made it myself  it was tasty because I like the ingredients rather than there was any skill in cooking it  My husband got steak in a stone  it was fine but not anything to write home about  He had a celeriac  and  lentil side where the lentils had been boiled with an inch of their life  they werent drained properly and then theyd thrown two bits of roasted celeriac in and theyd gone soggy  it was unpleasant  The food is extremely overpriced given the standard  By all means go to this restaurant once but keep your expectations low 
R0140,The service was not good as it was our first time and we thought the waiter should have more patience as the menu Was huge and lots to choose from I felt his impatience especially as it was quite  obvious with the rest of the clientele they were regulara  People came on after and were eating main course before us  The clamp burger the waiter said was not done yo their liking when there were lots of burger bring fired out very regularly it was not a good excuse I would have rathered he tell the truth he forgot about us 
R0140,"The service was very slow  When we were finished our dinner it took 15 minutes to get the plates taken away and I had to ask for desert menus  It also took 10 minutes after desert to get our bill  Once we got out bill another 5 minutes for the waiter to come with the credit card machine   

The gratuity was already included in the bill so the waiter wasnt concerned or even apologetic for the delay "
R0140,The sevice was excellent  The food was so tasty  full of natural ingredients and a delight to the palate  Would highly recommend it  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful  A delightful dining experience all round  Nell McCafferty
R0140,"The sliders are great and so is the ginger beer  

I went on a Thursday night with friends and we had a great time  The live music was excellent  the food was filling  and the terrace was poppin  

I had the 3 slider deal with sweet potato fries  The sliders were tasty  but made up of more bread than meat   definitely get something else if youre really hungry  The flatbread pizzas were a good size  and there were a lot of options 

The overall decor of the  felt warm and cozy  Great spot for dinner and drinks without the stuffiness of a restaurant "
R0140,The starter was lovely but sadly the mains were not tasty at all  Service was great though
R0140,The steak on the stone was relatively small in size  the side of chips consisted of 4 large chunky chips  very poor value for money 
R0140,The steaks were of very poor quality meat  and pretty mean portions 
R0140,Staff were all lovely and efficient  but there were far too many of them on duty  so a constant stream of interruptions at the table  Noisy  dated interior and very overpriced for what is basically a low quality steakhouse 
R0140,The style of food in this restaurant is subject to an aquired taste   The service was excellent but the manager having an argument with a member of staff in front of the customers was out of order 
R0140,"The ventilation and A/C on the ground floor is very bad  Maybe its because they have people cooking their dinner at the tables  but I left the restaurant smelling like a Leo Burdocks  While the Veggie options were ok  the Beetroot salad which sounded amazing was just ok  

Very nice waiter  The cooking food on stones in front of you is a cheap gimmick from the 80s or something  I dont understand it  Also  surely someone is going to get 3rd degree burns from it  It distracts from a night out when someone is cooking their dinner while your trying to have a conversation "
R0140,The waiters were more interested in standing around chatting and comparing muscles than remembering our order  We had to remind them of 2 courses  Although we were the only party in the downstairs part of the restaurant  we couldnt catch their attention  Even their clothes looked worn and too tight  The food was average  very hit and miss  The salads were huge but tasteless  The starters were good but nothing healthy on that list  The desserts were just strange  I definitely wouldnt recommend the sorbet    Carrot and fennel  Ugh  It tasted cheap and bland  Flavoured ice really 
R0140,There is a lovely atmosphere in the restaurant and the staff is very friendly and polite  but I was disappointed with the steak on stone that Ive ordered  There was a horrible smell coming out of the meat and the steak had some herbs on it  which I did not like 
R0140,There were four at the table  Three of us ordered steak on the stone  fillet   The stone was not hot enough to cook a steak to well done  Only one at the table liked it this way and so her steak never cooked past pink  She did not eat her main course and the overall feeling was disappointment 
R0140,There were very few options for vegetarian and the one I chose was not very imaginative  It is old fashioned to serve bit of veggies with cream and pasta  My husband ordered meat  but were dissapointed that he needed to cook it himself  I think that you come to restaurant also to get service and professional cooking  I dont see the point that we amateurs cook our own dinner in restaurant 
R0140,They put winegar in my pasta     how can someone put winegar in the pasta  It was disgusting  A part from this the overall experience was room below my expectations 
R0140,third time there hasnt disappointed each time   Friends really enjoyed it too 
R0140,This is a must do place in Dublin  Highly recommended  Food was beyond excellent 
R0140,This place had wonderful steak and overall  it didnt disappoint  The meat cuts were juicy and had the perfect meat/fat proportion  The ambiance of the restaurant was fantastic  The customer service was completely on point  prompt and proactive
R0140,This place is fantastic for vegans   I never would have thought it but after perusing their menu  there is a lot of choice on light bites  starters  sides etc   Really unusual options   Their cauliflower in coconunt milk is probably my favourite  but I love their bean salads  hummous  baba ganoush and avocado and tomatoe salad as well  We were able to get wine vouchers from menupoints for points   Highly recommended
R0140,"This restaurant had been my goto for Dublin visitors  so when my parents came to town and we had only one meal in Dublin I figured its a safe bet  Boy was I wrong  They could not have dropped the ball harder  

After a FULL HOUR I grabbed a random server  who had no intention of stopping at our table  and explained what was happening  He took our drink order  checked in with the kitchen and informed us there had been a ""miscommunication"" and our appetizer order wasnt put in  and therefore the entrees werent started  The food came out all at once 1:20 after ordering  


I wasnt going to write this review until I noticed a similar review theme of poor service and I want the restaurant to get the message  

"
R0140,"This restaurant was a great disappointment  We had not eaten in a ""stone"" restaurant before and it is not an experience we want to repeat   We like the chefs to cook our food to order  not have it cooking on  dangerously hot stones by our plates   Some of the beef had just come out of the fridge and browned before putting on the stone  whereas it should have been left out at room temperature for at least an hour before cooking  Some of the sides were overly elaborate  Why not serve chips as chips and not with piles of grated cheese and other additions  The potatoes are great  whether chips  mashed  boiled  and dont need dressing up "
R0140,This restaurant was great  First time there  Staff are exceptional and not OTT 
R0140,This restaurant was is and always will be a great location for great food in a special ambiance 
R0140,"This was a restaurant i was looking forward to dining at given the infamous steak on a stone   my conclusion   best leave that to the Portugese  My Sirloin came on the stone topped with onions   needless to say  it was messy trying to slice it and cook it 
The lentil bacon mash was decent  but not memorable   however  i did love the truffle pasta 
Service was a bit slow  and it didnt exactly feel welcoming nor warm upon arrival  It is however  conveniently located in the center of the city  near the infamous Long Hall   but if youre here visiting for a day  id skip this place and venture to find something more local and smaller   based on my own rating system  id give this a 1 2 "
R0140,This was our first time in this restaurant  it was a Thursday night at 7pm   We were a party of 3 business colleagues  The staff were excellent  very friendly and attentive  Unfortunately we were seated upstairs in amongst 4 tables with quite large groups  the table next to us was 4 Spanish students so the noise levels were insane  We had to shout to hear each other  The food was ok  Portions were small  particularly the starters but the food was beautifully cooked  It was my first time experiencing the hot stone idea and to be honest it wasnt my cup of tea  i chose the ribeye steak which was extremely fatty  perhaps I chose the wrong streak Overall I was dissappointed with the whole experience particularly for the price we paid 
R0140,This was our first visit and we had high expectations but we felt it a little underwhelming  The food was just ok and nothing special and a little overpriced  the service was perfect and everything else but the food was a big let down 
R0140,This was our first visit but will definitely not be the last   Great atmosphere  staff were superb and food was excellent   Would highly recommend it 
R0140,"Tiny tables  people are crammed into the restaurant like sardines  Excellent steak  but starters and sides dishes are minescule and very expensive for what one gets  What I really HATE about the restaurant is that no sooner had we finished the starters than the main course arrived  I expect a pause between courses to digest the previous one  it leaves the impression that one is been bundles through the meal to get ones money so the table can be freed up for the next punter 
I will not be going back"
R0140,Too expensive and wine cost huge  Not fair to add cost for sides  Eg chipped potatoes  Relaxed atmosphere 
R0140,Too many great choices on the menu to go just once  It was very good and tasty 
R0140,"Took a few clients to this place on Thursday night and although the service was excellent  the starter bites were also very good the mains were terrible  the quality if the beef  the finish and just the overall presentation was disgusting 

Good start  could not fault the service but bad finish"
R0140,Took parents for Christmas night out  Was disappointed with choices on menu  Very overpriced for what we got 
R0140,Top quality food delivered in an enjoyable atmosphere  Not inexpensive  but appropriately priced 
R0140,Top quality restaurant  food and service was excellent
R0140,"Unfortunately a very poor experience  Firstly the section we were seated on was not very nice that aside the service was cahotic it took 50 mins for us to be served  The food quality was lack lustre  Given the reputation of the restaurant I was very surprised not to mention disappointed  
The stone  you cook your food on it  seems to be a gimmick as my food was already over cooked on arrival  
Granted it was a busy bank holiday so perhaps a full house is not a good time to visit this restaurant maybe they should revisit their capacity and only take in what the kitchen/service team can support "
R0140,Its a shame we walked away quite unsatisfied 
R0140,Unfortunately  I couldnt recommend the restaurant  The Bonsai Bar upstairs was nice  but the food was a let down in the restaurant  Polenta Chips  just why  Beef in the beef burger was lost amongst all the extras     rocket  fried onions  pickeled red cabbage  and a tomato relish  And the side order of fries was served with pesto       The chocolate soup was too much about the show  and  not enough about the flavour  Overall it struck me as an over rated friend who thinks himself MasterChef  that doesnt understand combinations of flavour  and  in the end  just tried too hard 
R0140,Used ot be one of my favourite places to eat  Ive tried most things on the menu  Pork belly  fish and chips  the burger  salmon chickpea burger  The only problem I have some of the items on the menu are really small portion for the price  The quality is amazing but if youre going to cram food down your gullet try somewhere else or order sides  In particular the pork belly  Seems to get smaller every time I order it  It was the size of a starter last time 
R0140,Ventilation in the restaurant was not great  it was very warm and the smoke from the stones were filling the restaurant  at one point of the night it got so bad we asked the service staff to open the door  we paid fine dining prices for not so fine experience
R0140,Very average  small portions and difficult to find the value in the pricing    but the cocktails were awesome 
R0140,"Very busy place and extremely casual 
Just ok unfortunately   not enough staff  were waiting a lot for the food   the menu looks nice but  We had just 2 or 3 options   "
R0140,Very disappointed with the food standard  pasta dish was sitting in a pool of liquid which was very unappealing  rib eye quality was suspect 
R0140,"very disappointed with your restaurant  celebrating our sons graduation  had a most enjoyable day  however we all felt it was very average  my husband and two sons
had chicken wings  very average  for main course they had steaks  also very average  my daughter and I had burgers  not memorable  service was fair  very slow waited an hour and a  
half for main course to be served  we have eaten in other branches twice and also your sushi rest  both fantastic  wont be back here and wont recommend it to our friends "
R0140,"Very disappointing   packed into an overflow area next to the bar   bumped into all night with passing waiters  
Menu very limited   we ended up ordering burgers   Not what we hoped given the restaurants reputation   Wine selection straight from Aldi  House wine awful  Miserable birthday celebration  Wont be returning"
R0140,Very disappointing meal with friends  The service was terrible it appeared the waiter simply could not be bothered  He sat down and slouched on the couch when taking orders and stacked and scraped the plates on the table when collecting them  Food was good however the plate i was  given to cook my steak on was not hot  The waiter was no where to be seen   we were downstairs   so I could not ask him to rectify this  The rest of the food was great however and the wine and cocktails we had were fantastic  It was just such a pity about the service  I did not think he deserved the service charge that was added into our bill 
R0140,Very enjoyable experience and would highly recommend it food was delicious and flavors to die for  Will definitely be back for more 
R0140,Very friendly staff + amazing food and menu  Will be looking to come back again soon 
R0140,Very good all round
R0140,Very good food overall top class restaurant  with top class service           
R0140,"Very loud and service was slow  
We had beef on hot stone  but the stone were not hot enough for long enough 
We ordered Dexter beef which was available at order  but then were told is was not available "
R0140,Very nice  the waiters are really looking after you and the food is delicious
R0140,"Very overpriced     Very limited vegetarian options  Left restaurant hungry   

Did not find descriptions very accurate in comparison to what was put on table

Stuck in basement with no atmosphere  and  very claustrophobic 

Would not go back    "
R0140,Very poor on the food front  Tasteless steak  poor accompaniments  no pepper sauce FFS    mackerel not conducive to the salad  says herself    Euro 38 French Pinot Noir was like a bad Lidl Rioja
R0140,Very poor starters  portions were very small   a few of us got crab mayo toast and there was hardly any crab on the toast  thin layer at best   Steak for main was nice if you like you streak rare  medium but the serving method is not ideal if you like it a bit more cooked than that  and the serving method / on the stone stone can cause a lot of splattering of oil   which splattered on my short when I was served my tuna started on the stone and the waiter put some sort of oil on top of it   desert menu was poor  so we didnt order from it  Overall poor value for money  The service was good which was the main positive in my opinion  Nice attentive waiter  
R0140,very pricey to sit in a basement being bathed in constant smoke from burning meat in the kitchen  Vegetarian unfriendly as salads are expensive  ended up with a few sides but nothing to write home about   
R0140,Very slow service staff too busy and cocktail ridiculous size for price got about 3 mouthfuls  Menu dissapointing for anyone with food intolerances
R0140,Very tasty and great presentation of the salads and the meat  Excellent value for the salads as a healthy choice with curious combinations 
R0140,Very very cramped  we were practically sitting with the couples on either side of us  We could hear every word of their conversations  At one stage  the waiters rear end was approximately one inch away from my bread when he was clearing plates from the table next to us  not what you want to see while eating  Food overall was ok  the steak was lovely and the pesto chips were the highlight  Poor choices for a vegetarian  pasta  salad etc  Wont be returning or recommending 
R0140,Visited on a sat night  Tables crammed in beside each other; most waiters stressed out/uninterested unless youre one of their friends  did note one really great waiter  maybe from US/Canada  unfortunately not ours ; food only average; expensive for what it is   Euro 150 bill for 2 of us   All a bit sceney   not much substance  If youre looking for a relaxed dining experience and great food  suggest you look elsewhere 
R0140,Waited 20 mins at bar to get served  Was sitting at our table by the time our cocktails arrived   really just wanted a glass of wine by then   food just ok  service in restaurant was good  Not all that impressed  
R0140,Waiters are running and keep forgetting things  We felt like it was a bit unpersonal  more like a number  Food was good  Will probably not return  which is a pity
R0140,Was an awesome steak and great ambiance  Would go there again in a heartbeat 
R0140,Was awesome  
R0140,Wasnt very impressed  I got the lollipop prawns and asked if they did a main portion as the starters showed small or large  I was told yes and then when the bill came I was charged twice for a starter  So ended up paying  Euro 33 for 6 prawns  Wont be returning 
R0140,Wasnt very impressed   Seems extremely expensive to me and wasnt anything special at all  
R0140,"We actually left 2 minutes after we came in because the place was full of smoke coming from the stones where each person can cook their own food  In addition  we were offered a table in the basement  which had no ventilation  and it was literally 5 centimetres away from the table next to ours  
I am sure the ""on the stone"" concept is great  but they need to take this into account and ventilate the place properly so people dont leave smelling like a BBQ "
R0140,We are visiting Dublin on vacation and The restaurant was a fun dining experience with great food 
R0140,We arrived for a early dinner  we felt that the restaurant was still getting ready for that evening  There must have been a new wine list or something  as the staff were standing in a group at the door commenting on the wine list  which I didnt find very relaxing whilst I was having my meal  also shouting down the stairs for different orders etc  We didnt relax in the setting  We ordered chicken wings to start to share  and these were nice  The breads were not nice  I enjoyed my main course  however  Euro 35 for a steak  with no side is awful value  We didnt bother staying for desert 
R0140,We ate here Saturday night and the service was the worst I have ever experienced  Expected so much more from this restaurant  Very disappointing  would not eat there again 
R0140,"We ate there on Friday lunch time  a little busy with only one server  a manager  and  a runner working  
We had looked up the menu online and were really interested in trying the Rustic raw menu  had even picked what we wanted  
When we got the menu  we werent presented with the raw menu so I asked the server  We were informed that the raw menu had been taken off over a year and a half ago  I informed the server that it was still on the website and he apologised   
So  after that the food was a disappointment  Ordered the burger  which is impossible to eat  have to deconstruct it and eat in sections  the salmon tempura was under seasoned  and  not very hot  Ordered a couple of sides  roasted cauliflower which was tasty  the bean salad with was very salty  
Had an excellent Portuguese red and a macchiato  
Dont think well be back "
R0140,We booked an early evening dinner and on arrival we were given every menu except the early bird one   We were never told about the specials   which apparently are up on a board which was never indicated to us   We requested water when ordering wine   that took another reminder before we got it   and when we did it was just a very small glass of WARM water   We requested iced water and received ice in an ugly glass   When we wanted a further glass of water we had to ask twice  yet again   One of our party received the incorrect mains   and with a barely audible apology  it was taken away   The service overall was not as expected  and certainly not up to the standard of most restaurants 
R0140,We booked table at 5pm before going to the theatre  but were not offered the early menu   We chose from the full evening menu  but then discovered other people sitting around us had been offered the early menu   a bit disappointing
R0140,We eat there a lot and have always enjoyed it but last night was not the same   The table was not great to start its beside the toilets and very very noisy it was a wk station for the staff beside us   The food is always good but last night not so    The chips were cold the stones were also cold and had to be replaced and a few items we asked for not on the menu   While paying we spoke to the manager who dealt with it very professionally 
R0140,"We ended up in the basement of the restaurant and this was not very inspiring   My colleagues had the hamburger and were happy with their choice   I ordered the fillet steak and was somewhat disappointed   The meat was fine but certainly not great   And the chips served were lukewarm at best and not that tasty   For the money paid  I would have expected more   

This was my third time in this restaurant   To be honest  I wont rush to go back    If you like to cook your own meat/fish at the table its an OK choice   If that is not a major concern  then you may want to try another restaurant "
R0140,"We enjoyed our meal although we felt it was better on previous occasions  
Having spent 250 euro on the meal   it was quite expensive and to be honest we are not sure it was worth that unfortunately "
R0140,We enjoyed our visit  the food was lovely  the service was great  our table was in a good spot  and wine and cocktails a great plus 
R0140,We found the service to of a low standard waiters where verry scruffy looking and looked to be under pressure the food was only verry fair my crab starter was watery   crab not of a great quality my lamb burger was cold and impossible to eat on a small rock  desert was ok the decor was nice but very dirty window blinds curtains falling down on the stairs and the toilets only very average   For a chef that takes pride in his attention to detail hes not doing a good job I could go on and on to be fair  i would be very slow to return thanks
R0140,We had a dinner with 4 brothers and our dad on a trip from Amsterdam  It was excellent 
R0140,We had high expecations  but it was dissapointing   The food was ok but overpriced   Very  very small desert for almost 10 euro  The waiter  Italian   Was ok to us but very rude to a  couple next to us 
R0140,"We had salads for starters which were good and also creatively presented 
Next up was the main  which we had to change as they ran out of the T Bone Steak  Serving meat on a hot stone is definitely a nice experience but in a restaurant within that price range you would not expect to be left alone with the cooking of your meat yourself  The sides where nothing special but still relatively expensive in comparison  One guest ordered the lamb pasta dish  The meat was chewy and dry 

We expected a lot due to good reviews but we left unsatisfied  I would not want to return as I believe there are many alternative options regarding better price/value in Dublin "
R0140,We had such a lovely meal  great service and great food 
R0140,"We liked the atmosphere of this place  the waitress was very friendly and enthusiastic which we enjoyed  
However food was not anything more than ordinary  There is plenty of restaurants in Dublin that do steaks of the same quality for much better value  We were also disappointed by the noise  Tables are so close together that you can clearly hear what people next to you are talking about  plus the background music was too loud and disturbing  
All in all it wasnt a bad experience but we left the restaurant disappointed "
R0140,"We ordered ""THE ROLLS ROYCE OF SIRLOIN 10OZ ""on the stone"" with PESTO CHIPS WITH GARLIC AND TOMATO AND PARMESAN 
By the time I had trimmed the fat/grisel off the steak I got a few good size pieces  by the time I had cooked to my liking my chips were cold and tasteless  Also a point to make using your utensils to pick up raw food  which you then use to eat with  If you actual review the menu the majority of the main food is ""on the stone"" which I enquired is 60 70 percent of the food orders isnt bad when the customer comes in and cooks their own food and pays for it 
The restaurant felt claustrophobic  our table for two  I could hardly maneuver my chair  my elbow nearly contacted my neighbours and the atmosphere and noise was that of a canteen "
R0140,We should have done more research  We were aware that the food was served on stones  But the waiter did not point out that the steak would be cooked by ourselves on a stone  No one checked if we were ok with everything  on  might have ordered another glass of wine if they had  And my fish in the bag was plopped down unceremoniously on the table for me to fish it out as best I  could  Did not feel the experience matched the bill for  Euro 80 for two   For one course and not even a bowl of bread  Would not go again 
R0140,"We stumbled upon this place one day for lunch as the menu looked really appetizing  The restaurant was very clean and updated  This was one of the first restaurants I found in Dublin that had salads on their menu as a main entree  We each got a different salad and their salads were very fresh  tasty and filling  Since we were there during lunch  they had a great lunch menu that included dessert  Their desserts were amazing as well  We came to find that Dublin has really good Italian food and desserts  Definitely would visit this restaurant again  

We came back a year later and we were excited to go back to this restaurant  They were incredibly rude to us and made us feel very uncomfortable  We will not be returning "
R0140,We used to go regularly  but on Saturday  the main course was awful   i had the rump of beef on the stone  it was so fatty and sinewy  i couldnt eat it   Service is good as always  staff are really nice  but the food has gone very poor in my opinion 
R0140,We visited Dublin for my wifes birthday   What an amazing place   Highly recommend this T Bone on the stone 
R0140,We visited here on a taste voucher   Service was excellent and quality of food was superb  We shared wings and bread and dips for starters  We then had burgers and rump of beef served on hot stone followed by chocolate mousse and raw fruit  Flavours were all excellent   Great value for money and would highly recommend 
R0140,We visited here on a taste voucher   Service was excellent and quality of food was superb  We shared wings and bread and dips for starters  We then had burgers and rump of beef served on hot stone followed by chocolate mousse and raw fruit  Flavours were all excellent   Great value for money and would highly recommend 
R0140,"We went out with another couple for dinner while on vacation in Dublin  The stone cooking was intriguing and the reviews were good  We booked a reservation and upon arrival our table was not ready  but they ushered us to the upstairs bar  which was fine and we werent opposed to drinking  When our table was ready  we asked our waitress about a certain wine we were thinking about purchasing  and her reply was ""I prefer more expensive wine ""    needless to say  we were offended  as we asked her opinion and had she recommended ""a more expensive"" bottle without the attitude  we probably would have appreciated her advice  The next kicker was when the stones came out with the steaks  they give strict instruction to remove your meat asap  cut it into pieces and cook it this way as to not over cook your meat  We obliged but one of the other couples steaks was already cooked medium well when he cut into it  When we brought it to the waitresses attention so she could get him another steak  she was very rude and very condescending when she returned when the new steak saying he had to take it off this time so it wouldnt happened again  Anyways  the rudeness of the staff completely ruined the food  even if it was tastey  Definitely the worst hospitality we received our entire 2 week visit to Ireland "
R0140,We went to celebrate the twins birthday  Excellent night with fabulous food  Service was very attentive and we were treated royally  Highly recommended 
R0140,We went to have a lunch few weeks ago  The whole experience was dreadful  The parmigiana we had for starter was tasteless  swimming in a boiling tomato sauce; it had been probably heated up in the microwave far too long  Then  my boyfriend had a pizza and he was sick for the rest of the day after eating it  I grew up in Italy and regrettably this is far away from being authentic Italian food 
R0140,"We went for our date night  We already had in mind what we will eat 

We have arrived into restaurant earlier around 8 PM while reservation was for 8:30PM   once I have approached waiter and told him that we have arrived earlier he just looked at myself and partner like we were some homeless people and said: ""well I guess you can sit at the bar for 31minutes""  which I found very rude  

We waited at the bar and enjoyed lovely cocktails until 8:40 PM approached us and we were still not at our table   We found our ""lovely"" host and told him again that we had reservation at 8:30PM and can we get our table and with the most furious look on his face he took us to our table 

We have ordered steaks on stone which arrived quickly  Our waiter downstairs was nice but again did not see approachable  

All in all  steaks were fine   but would not come back due to waiters and their attitude "
R0140,"We went after recommendations   We were seated in the basement next to a  a filthy closet/utility room  which one of us looked straight into  the staff never closed the door  It was also a combined wine storage so the staff were running   just at our table  in and out of the closet fetching wine all evening  really disturbing  It should not be a table situated there  one of our worst seatings ever 
Service ok  by the book  but no heart  The waiter + waitress did their job  no more  
Food too pretentious  small portions  not worth the price "
R0140,"We were a little bit disappointed by the restaurant  We were there 2 years ago  and we loved it really much that we ate there 2 times in 4 days  so we wanted to go back  
But the quality has decreased compared to the past 
My pasta wasnt warm anymore  my sister had 2 hairs in her salmon  The sirloin on the hot stone was good but not overwhelming  
Nonetheless the service was good and they took off the salmon of the bill  We wont go back in the near future  It is a pity   "
R0140,We were here twice before and had a great experience  Last Saturday was very average   unmemorable food and service  The 2 sharing platters for starters came on one slate and was tiny   for  Euro 36  Overall disappointing   
R0140,We were aware at booking  that the table was due back within two hours  We were there for a special birthday dinner  just family  The waiter was very nice but a little too eager to sell us other items on the menu  One person who eats rather slowly was annoyed by at least 3 attemts to remove their plate before they had finished their meal  The table was obviously booked for a larger party after our reservation  but placing the extra table beside our table when we still had almost 25 mins left and even before we had asked for the bill was unnecessary and definitely distracting  The food  as ever  is the star of the show  but we probably wont be back for another performance 
R0140,We were gifted our meal    It was a special offer voucher   The previous times I have dined here I felt the food was much better   The previous times we ordered off the al a carte menu   This time around both my partner and myself felt that the food was only average  I started with the salmon and my partner had the wings   both were good   We both had steak   I had the sirloin for which I paid a supplement   Neither were tasty  My pepper type of pesto rub was unusual to say the least and there was a lot of fat on the steak   I know sirloin is meant to have some fat on it   I cant remember the name of the desserts other than one had a type of jelly as a component and the other was a very running type of mousse   Neither of us finished our desserts  Coffee and cocktails were very good and service was excellent 
R0140,"We were met at the door by the rudest receptionist ever <6:15> Saturday:  when we asked to allocate us a table at the back of the restaurant she slammed the Menus on the table    

The fact that we were charged us  Euro 34 for a steak without a veg or potato is a total rip off and a burger and a few chips  Euro 18
This restaurant will end up like the Mint cause people are only fooled once but never again"
R0140,"We were seated just inside main door on to street  on a bitterly cold evening so when any new patrons entered  sometimes in groups which meant that the door remained open for some time until they had checked in  This resulted in a very unplasent experience with a cold breeze swirling around our table  I did mention the situation to a member of staff to switch on the overhead heaters at the entrance door  which are designed to alleviate this problem  he told me they were on  but in my opinion not working 
This problem needs to be addressed "
R0140,We were told that if we wanted the early bird menu  everyone in the party had to have food from the menu and not from the a la carte  which was not stated in their website  Had I known this  I wouldnt have choosen this restaurant 
R0140,We were very disappointed having been here before  The burger was plain and dry for 26 euro  with so many good burger places today    the pasta was cold and we both agreed that the whiskey sour tasted awful  There was nothing wrong with the experience other than the food but the food was definitely lacking  I think its a safe bet if youre going for the steak but I wont be going back based on the food this time 
R0140,"Well talk about customer service this place needs to send most of their staff on a long course   We where upstairs for drinks and food   Staff threw menu at our table and walked off   �not a great start   Ordered drinks beers and cocktail  draft beer very limited on draft thats disappointing for a bar   High priced as well   Got prawns which where like rubber  I wasnt even giving a knife and fork   Staff are so so rude   couldnt eat the prawns   To top it off there is obviously no age policy at door as was surrounded by under age girls taking selfies and drinking   for sure underage   
Definetly �wouldnt recommend � "
R0140,Went for a birthday meal and found the restaurant to be very over priced  We both got steak on the stone  one fillet and one sirloin  Both steaks were very fatty and poor quality meat  The side dishes were not included  Myself and my partner had two steaks  two sides and two alcoholic drinks each and the bill was over  Euro 120 euro which was outrageous for the quality of the food   Tables were placed too close together which meant we had to listen to other patrons full conversations and they ours  Would not recommend this restaurant 
R0140,This place has no class 
R0140,"Went here on our 2nd evening in Dublin from London have to say was very busy but clearly this restaurant needs to have less tables as no room to move and may aswell sat on strangers sides    Love having the lava stone to cook on and been to many others but really 16 euros for 3 large raw  prawns with a melon ball on the end o a cocktail stick  
My concern was also you were served your steak/ fish raw on he stone starting to cook and advised by he waiter to put it into plate and cut it up then cook it returning it onto the same plate you just had the raw meat on surely this cannot be right  health and safely anyone     
So all in all not a great dining experience disappointed and broke  "
R0140,Went there for New years Eve dinner as I saw the restaurant was rated quite highly online  First impression was that it was very busy and smelly we were rushed along to a table There was little to no space in between tables and it was extremely loud and smelly from all the stakes being cooked on the rocks around us  i will definitely need to dry clean my coat and dress after this   The food was ok   The concept that you have to cook it yourself  was not something we were aware of and frankly would have been nice if that was explained prior to ordering  All sides needed to be ordered separately  beside 35 EUR for a piece of meat you have to fry yourself  Once our plates were cleared immediately after we finished we were asked if we will order dessert  When we said no the waiter immediately dropped the bill to our table and left No drink refill  nothing  I think we spent the total of 40 minutes of being in the restaurant which was supposed to be a romantic dining experience turned out to be something of a Mcdonalds kind service and speed  The manager approached us later and offered a glass of prosecco to say sorry for our experience which we are grateful for  But I will not return and will not recommend the place 
R0140,Went there for the girlfriends birthday and everything was brilliant  Great food and great service  Highly recommend  
R0140,"Went there on a Sunday evening and was greated by a very courteous gentleman who allowed that we could wait downstairs as our table wasnt quite ready  It was a matter of only minutes before we were seated  Our waiter walked over after a bit and we asked if he would pour us some water which he did and he filled the glass to full and it slopped onto the table   a big enough amount to splash the menu and myself across the table  No  ""Im sorry"" or "" let me clean that up""    he left it  Then walked off as if he couldnt be bothered  We had the barman  who was kind and gracious clean it as we had no linen at the table yet  He acted he whole night as if we were a bother  We didnt leave a tip and as we left  he made sure to say loudly   ""thanks"""
R0140,What a alovely place  Booked this for my 50th birthday  The food was absolutely excellent  So was the service  And on top of that I got a very nice birthday desert  I can highly recommend this place 
R0140,What used to be one of Dublins best has lost its way  Slow and grumpy service  Mediocre food  Was given a broken chair to sit on 
R0140,When I went to complain about my food which I had to send back  got the beef pasta  couldnt get my knife and fork I to the beef  I was told all the beef had been overcooked and I could order something else even though my husband was almost finished his meal so I went with no food  the manager was aggressive  rude and argumentative with me  I am 8 and half months pregnant  
R0140,When they realised we were using a voucher  their service/manner changed     not for the better  However  food very good 
R0140,"While the food was good  the concept of cooking it yourself on a table with limited space does not work  
A friend and I shared a T bone steak and were told that we should take it off the hot stone and cut it into slices that were to be returned to the hot stone to be cooked to the desired degree  On what were we supposed to cut this large piece of meat    small glass plates that could not accomodate the steak  With what were we supposed to cut this piece of meat   small  blunt steak knives  It just did not work 
Between the hot stone  dishes of vegetables  sauces and plates  the table was overcrowded  

A nice idea but I shall not return "
R0140,While traveling to Ireland for a wedding  a group of friends and myself decided we wanted to try a few of the best restaurants in the area  After reading a few reviews  we decided to make reservations  We were seated the minute we walked in for our reservations  and enjoyed every second of our experience  From the ambience  to the service  to the food  it was excellent  I highly recommend the light bites  Beet Salad  and Carrot Soup 
R0140,Will not be going back
R0140,"Not a pleasant experience  Sunday brunch was awful
"
R0140,"With such regret I cant bring myself to rate this restaurant any higher than 2 stars  After reading so many positive reviews here about the delicious food I felt I had to try this for myself  

I ordered rump steak to share  millionaire fries and spinach  The meal was the most basic meal I have ever paid for in a restaurant like this  The steak was fine but I felt no effort was made to make it better seasoning or otherwise   I felt like it had been thrown on a hot pan for a few minutes and that was all  The millionaire fries I heard sooooo much about came out looking nothing like the pics here  check my pics for proof  they were incredibly disappointing  You could taste the dirty grease off them  As for the spinach    there was again no effort to make the spinach taste any better  I tasted like it was dumped into hot water for a few minutes and left to sit in the merky water after for even longer before it was served  left a kind of dry gritty taste/feeling in my mouth if you know what I mean  

After all that I thought a nice dessert would rescue the poor experience but alas they didnt even have a dessert menu  even a few scoops of ice cream would have sufficed   

The staff were friendly and attentive initially but seemed distracted when we wanted to get the bill and leave  we had to ask twice for the bill and then for them to take the money after it sitting there for some time  

It felt like no thought whatsoever was put into this restaurant and left a very disappointed customer "
R0140,Wont be coming back to this place  disgraceful 
R0140,Wonderful food and great service from the wait staff  
R0140,Wonderful  thank you 
R0140,Would not recommend this restaurant   Way over priced and a bit cramped   Will not return 
R0140,Yeah  youll be waiting 15 minutes for a table  And the food isnt great  And its overpriced
R0141,Absolutely fantastic food with a lovely and welcoming staff  I will make sure to visit again the next time Im in Dublin 
R0141,Food and service are always outstanding everytime I visit   Would highly recommend for lunch or dinner dates 
R0141,Food was really delicious and the service was 10 out of 10  We will be back
R0141,Good food and friendly service  They let them selves down a bit with the atmosphere  as it lacks warmth / ambience 
R0141,Really quality food and drinks
R0141,Terrific  authentic food   Take their chili pepper indicators for level of spiciness as marked 
R0141,The food   drinks and service were sublime
R0141,Top class service  lively ambience  delicious food  healthy sized portions  Highly recommended 
R0142,Amazing service   The waiter recommended dishes for us and was really attentive
R0142,Bad overall  A but overpriced for the meal we had 
R0142,"Birthday 
I would definitely return great for a group lovely food Nd great value"
R0142,Busy spot with great ambience   Food was superb
R0142,Dark  hard to read menu  Waitress who took order was very unfriendly 
R0142,Delicious food and friendly service  They were also happy to split the bill for us which makes things so much easier in a group 
R0142,Delicious food at a great price with friendly staff  Definitely recommended  �Great tea and coffee and a good selection of juices 
R0142,Excellent food and service in a great setting 
R0142,"Fab    as always   
Great  food  atmosphere  ticks all the boxes for a night out    "
R0142,Food was amazing and the staff are very helpful
R0142,Good bar where we celebrated our betrothal with a bottle of sparkles 
R0142,Good burgers  Decent fries  
R0142,Great breakfast  couldnt fault the food  the service and the location  Great all around 
R0142,Great for a catchup with a friend  Nice lively atmosphere  busy  but still able to hear other person clearly  Hadnt been there in years but will be going back soon 
R0142,Im giving it 2 stars because the waiter was very disrespectful and unaccommodating 
R0142,I used to eat here regularly and love it  But unfortunately yesterday the tusan bean soup was tasteless   Its a pity as i hadnt been around for a while and was quite disappointed
R0142,Lovely as always  Never disappointed when I come here 
R0142,Service was slow and could have been more attentive  One manager seemed to holding everything together and everyone else just clearing tables
R0142,Stodgy food  Nothing special 
R0142,Table was booked for 8 30pm on a Sunday evening  Food was very good  During the main course I requested another portion of rice  It never arrived  The restaurant was very quiet so I cant understand how it was forgotten  No dessert menu was offered after our main course  No tea or coffee was offered either  Only one other table was occupied when we finished  It seemed that the staff just wanted rid of us so they could have an early night  It was the first time ever I didnt leave a tip in a restaurant  We wont be going back  Shame  as the food was good 
R0142,"The main reason its 2 stars for me  the food was stacked on a tiny plate  It was like playing a game of food Jenga  I literally couldnt eat anything without something falling off  Add to that some dodgy brand of tomato ketchup which was frankly not nice  I really didnt enjoy the experience  
"
R0142,"The service was a bad surprise  Ive been to here before and never had an issue  That night  it was a succession of problems: 
  almost 40 minutes between the order and the food
  they brought our mains instead of the starters
  after another 15 minutes of waiting  they brought the starters but the one for my friend was wrong; thew waiter gave us attitude by saying ""but I asked you twice""  
  with all the delays and having to give the table back after 2 hours  there was no time to get a dessert and we were sick of sitting in the place anyway  

The manager was very good and knocked off 2 items from the bill  
I will go again because the food is worth it  but if the service is bad again I will call the person out on the spot "
R0142,"Truly awful food 
Our starters arrived approximately three minutes after we arrived 
Dry tasteless food  no spicy  nothing fresh 
Mains were similarly awful 

This is the worst possible interpretation of Mexican food 

I will not be returning "
R0142,Very enjoyable 
R0142,Very saucy dishes  lots of sweetness and lacking finer flavors    does not represent true Thai or Vietnamese cuisine    quite disappointing   
R0142,"
For main courses go for quantity over quality  For 8 EUR the pasta portions are very generous and appears to be good value  but the Bolognese sauce on my spaghetti was very bland  When I pay for it  expect it to be just as good if not better than the SpagBol I make at home  


"
R0142,"Well  Ceasar salad was with 1   one  little slice of cucumber  2 cherry tomatoes and loads of unwashed leaves  Chicken was tiny  There were no croutons  no ceasar dressing  no parmesan cheese    I dont understand what happened 
Bbq sandwich   8 eu      Very tiny  bacon burned out and dry  It wasnt cooked recently 
Best of all food was fries 
Left 30 eu for nothing  
Do not recommend this place "
R0143,Beautiful tacos  and  avacado toast  Good service  will go again
R0143,Everything was amazing and perfect  Staff were lovely and place was buzzing in great way 
R0143,Excellent food and service
R0143,Food was delicious and service from our waiter Sean was excellent  
R0143,Food was incredible  we practically licked the plates clean  and  as per usual the staff were impressive as always   
R0143,Great food
R0143,Great meal with fantastic service  Id recommend the cocopops toast from the brunch menu
R0143,Really enjoyed our evening and the flexibility of the staff was excellent as well as the value for money  Cant wait to go back 
R0143,The �breakfast of champions� could do with the addition of a slice of toast 
R0143,The food was amazing and the service was great  The guy serving us was funny  polite and extremely good at his job
R0143,The waiter was excellent  He was very patient even though it took us a long time to decide    and was happy to give recommendations 
R0143, Nice place  Loved the coffee
R0143,"A terribly generic bar with below average over priced cocktails 

My latest trip was the Friday before Christmas 

I ordered a Heineken and it tasted like dish water 

I ordered an expensive Old Fashioned and it was served to me in about 2 minutes  I knew it would be bad and it was  Bleurgh 

I have had food here before and its not bad  

Its just an average predictable bar for this area that I always seem to be dragged to under duress every few months "
R0143,A sister restaurant  Its comforting Italian food  go here if your looking to treat yourself to something cheesy and filling 
R0143,Absolutely excellent food   ambiance and service  We were two couples who had a great evening
R0143,"After all the hype and the few tries to get a table at this place  finally we got dinner here and I have to say I wasnt very impressed  I was expecting a steak cooked to perfection since they only have 2 main courses to choose from  The meat was chewy  my dairy free option  no butter on steak  left it tasteless  and the medium rare was well overcooked 

The only thing that impressed me was the price  50 euros for two main courses  two sides and two glasses of  too warm  red wine  The service was correct  

At least it wasnt too pricey but nothing much beyond the hype  Wouldnt bother to come back "
R0143,After booking a table we were told to wait ten minutes  15 minutes later we were seated and told to be out in 55 minutes  The person who showed us to our table appeared to forget we had booked even though he took our name and ticked us off the list   We were then told we had 1 hour and 15 mins  Very disappointing service but food was nice  
R0143,Altogether good meal was slightly ruined by a waiter who rolled his eyes whenever we asked him for anything    we werent at all demanding  asked for some ketchup for the breakfasts  there were three of us and he begrudgingly brought over a tiny pot so asked a bit more and he almost slammed it down on the table   very uncalled for  we hadnt asked for anything else all meal 
R0143,"Always tasty
Crostini grande was delish  "
R0143,Amazing brunch  
R0143,AMAZING brunch    will definitely be back  perfect place to go before a rugby match   great food and ambience all around 
R0143,Amazing food and very friendly staff  Will definitely be back
R0143,amazing food from start to finish  the cheesecake is a must  such good value for money  one and only downfall the tables are too close together 
R0143,Amazing food with a generous portion size    oh and the mimosas are unreal  Super staff who are so nice and efficient   couldnt recommend more  
R0143,Amazing food with excellent service   Well worth the price 
R0143,Arrived earlier than booked  been advised that our table would have hardly been available as scheduled  So went outside for a pint and got back later on  there were 2 tables available for sitting 2 persons  We asked for one but been told that we could not sit there as would have been used to serve 3 people  so we sat at the other one  15 minutes later the same table has been gave to a couple         Weve been told that was reserved for a trio         Food not bad but quite expensive for the experience and took so long to being served even though half the tables were empty   although the restaurant was half empty I had to ask twice for the bill and a woman beside us has been served a normal coffee although she asked for a decaffeinated 
R0143,As always a great evening iin this place great food and reasonably priced
R0143,Average food   good venue   good staff   good drinks
R0143,Awesome food   Better than I expected as first time visitor from US 
R0143,Awesome NY style pizza  Large is huge  Quick  Easy  Yummy  Staff is nice  Got a cheese and the kids were happy to have some comfort food far from home 
R0143,Awesome restaurant  basically guaranteed to have a good meal here 
R0143,Beautiful restaurant   food was excellent  Staff were great and the ambience was warm   Highly recommend
R0143,Been here a couple of times   lovely food  would definitely recommend especially for brunch 
R0143,"Been twice and both times service has let it down 
Will avoid in the future "
R0143,"Been twice and both times service has let it down 
Could be somewhat forgivable if the food was outstanding which it was not 
Will avoid in the future "
R0143,"BEST BRUNCH EVER IN DUBLIN 
COOL AND INTIMATE ATMOSPHERE AT THE SAME TIME"
R0143,Best place in Dublin for brunch   Friendly staff  great atmosphere  excellent menu and delicious food 
R0143,Brilliant for weekend Brunch  Good food  great location  Only down fall is tables are extremely close together and the restaurant seems cramped 
R0143,Brunch booked for 11 am and at 11 59 am  we were told we had to vacate the table  We will not go back
R0143,Brought my mum here for brunch and both dishes were incredible  large portions and very tasty 
R0143,Brunch booked for 11 am and at 11 59 am  we were told we had to vacate the table  When we queried this  we were told the brunch table is for 1 hour 15 mins and we had been there 1 hour 11 mins  Timed from when my guest arrived ten mins early  We will not go back
R0143,Brunch of champions was only alright  tea didnt come that my friend ordered  big deal but then not all the dishes came out at the same time  we had to wait a few minutes for 2 vegetarian dishes to arrive  The vegetarian dishes were swimming in oil and the service wasnt particularly attentive 
R0143,Brunch table was reserved 1:45 mins but we were seated late and pushed out after an hour and 15mins
R0143,Bruschetta starter with sardines was soaked in sauce so that the bread turned into a sponge and the sardines had huge backbones and loads of small bones throughout  whole dish was wrong  My father had prawns which came with toast which was also submerged in sauce turning it into a sopping wet sponge also  Very simple mistakes  Main courses were better but still everything was covered in sauce and vegetables were limp and overcooked  You can tell chefs cant do basics right and try to cover up  Food is overpriced  table space is small  service is average 
R0143,Cannelloni are divine  Everything else was very good too
R0143,"coco pop french toast is the only moderately good thing  people without reservations where being sat before me who had booked a table 
We were left standing for ten mins before getting our table 

My food was disgusting  crab cakes tasted like uncooked dough 

Insanely expensive for an overcrowded horrible brunch with terrible service "
R0143,Insanely expensive for an overcrowded horrible brunch with terrible service 
R0143,Coco Pop French Toast is a must  Amazing food  good service and great atmosphere  definitely will be back 
R0143,Cozy restaurant with really tasty food and amazing brunch  Might be busy for brunch so I totally recommend booking a table before hand
R0143,Cracking food  great atmosphere and friendly staff 
R0143,Despite booking a table in advance we had to wait for 15 minutes to be seated because of how ridiculously busy the restaurant was during brunch hours on a Sunday  
R0143,This day was just an anomaly but I definitely wouldnt recommend it because of this experience; the food was fine but nothing out of the ordinary  there are plenty of fantastic brunch spots around Dublin where you wouldnt experience this kind of madness 
R0143,Delicious brunch with cool options  The coco pops french toast was extremely tasty and filling  Very quick and friendly service 
R0143,Delicious brunch 
R0143,Delicious food   the cheesecake sooo good  Staff are so friendly and service is fast  Gets busy but luckily we left before the huge crowd got there

Had a delightful evening 
Will defiantly be back"
R0143,"Dined here before and was blown away by the quality of food  drinks and service 
However  this time the food was average  i e Luke warm and frankly bland   Cocktails were also awful  sorry for being blunt but really not impressed they were either really sour or watery   
Service was also way too fast   we were served our starters 5mins after ordering while we had only finished before our plates were taken away and the mains came about 10mins after  We understand the need to turn tables but when its rushed you dont feel comfortable as a customer   Our waitress was lovely though  
Unfortunately wont be in a rush back  "

Unfortunately wont be in a rush back  "
R0143,Disappointed with my choice which was the ham  poached eggs  asparagus  The ham tasted rubbery and there was too much of it on the plate  It was cold which made the rest of the ingredients cold  I regretted my order as soon as I saw it  But my friends dish looked great and most of the plates around us too  I just made a bad choice and had major food envy   I wouldnt recommend that particular dish 
R0143,Substandard French toast  and  bacon
R0143,Disappointing brunch  Had been some months since we visited but used to be our favorite brunch spot  Not any more  Substandard French toast  and  bacon  Disgraceful
R0143,Seated 20 minutes late  Given very little time to read the menu before asked if we were ready to order  we asked for a few more moments and were forgotten about after 15 minutes we had to ask to be served  After all that the food took its time coming out  By which time there was a very a uncomfortable atmosphere between us and the waiting staff 
R0143,Disappointing  as a returning customer who would have had nothing but praise for this place  Seated 20 minutes late  Given very little time to read the menu before asked if we were ready to order  we asked for a few more moments and were forgotten about after 15 minutes we had to ask to be served  After all that the food took its time coming out  By which time there was a very a uncomfortable atmosphere between us and the waiting staff 
R0143,Disappointing  lukewarm food  crab cakes lacked flavour  cold hollandaise sauce on poached eggs  wont be rushing back  its all a bit rushed  perhaps if they were less concerned with getting in as many covers as possible they could take more care with what was a mediocre plate of food 
R0143,Frutti de mare worst ever 
R0143,Dreadful pastas overcooked and sardine bruchetta was as good as john west tin in tomato sauce and heated under a grill  Frutti de mare worst ever  Not ruhsing back
R0143,Early bird not as advertised on website  in fact some options cheaper by not taking the early bird  Not advised of this when called to confirm  When asked told that was the way it was  Avoid Christmas early bird a rip off
R0143,Even though the place was packed  if you have a reservation they get you your table fast   Great atmosphere  fast and friendly service  extremely tasty food in good f not on the larger side of portions  Highly recommended and good for group occasions 
R0143,Everything was fantastic as always  Its a place I am constantly recommending friends 
R0143,Everything was good  but with so many great restaurants in Dublin  having a good meal is not good enough 
R0143,"Everything was great here  Ambience/food/service

R0143,Fantastic service and great food   the turmeric and ginger latte   A must  Super fresh ingredients
R0143,fantastic service  Very well run establishment with friendly staff  Food was excellent as were the cocktails  Highly recommend 
R0143,Fine dining prices for mass produced food  Expected more 
R0143,Food and restaurant were absolutely amazing and we were really looking forward to brunch here  however one staff member really let the whole experience down  I would not recommend or return again based on her service  We were a party of two couples and wanted to pay separately  which is pretty normal now and not unheard of   This staff member  wish I got her name but she was blonde and not Irish  seemed annoyed at our request  asked us how much our breakfast was  when we said we thought she would tell us she said she would give us five minutes to work it out ourselves and stormed off  Confused  we waited for her to return and she was even more annoyed when we still couldnt tell her how much we owed her in total  Instead of explaining her thought process  she angrily looked for a calculator  slammed it on the table in front of us  told us to add it up ourselves and then give her the amount and our card  Absolutely disgusting service and attitude  What business / restaurant operates like this   Really took away from how nice the food was  We will not be returning and we will be letting everyone know about this as its 100 percent unacceptable for any restaurant in Dublin city center 
R0143,Food and atmosphere was great 
R0143,Food and service brilliant as usual  The wait staff and manager were very pleasant and efficient considering the large parties they were catering too 
R0143,Food and service were both amazing  One of my favourite places to eat 
R0143,Food and service were great 
R0143,Food is always good when Im here   Always worth the bus in 
R0143,"Food pretty good  Menu is small but i was ok with that 
Food is pretty good  Service was great and the atmosphere is brillant"
R0143,"Food quality was great  but overshadowed by sloppy service Would recommend restaurant only to someone who does not care much about service Staff was unattentive  pointed out that coats are on the way of arriving diners and only took coats away when was asked No aknowledgement when we were leaving almost like noone cared as long as bill was paid  Bill was put on the table with words ""you have to leave by 7 45 p m  as table booked for that time""  with no gentle reminder beforehand  Had to chase waitress for desert Table was served by diffirent waitresses  and unfortunately only one was making effort who seemed to be supervisor of some sort  At the end we had to wait for waitress to remind that she needs to bring our coats so we can leave  It is unfortunate that all of us  6 at the table will remember bad service about the place  and not great quality of food  Credit to kitchen staff "
R0143,Food quality was very poor  I have being in this restaurant years ago and food was of better quality  But we went on sat night and very dissapointed 
R0143,Food very very average now and all dishes we were served was overpowered by pesto and rocket  Friends have had the same experience lately
R0143,Food was amazing and staff were great  really good spot for dinner with friends
R0143,Food was amazing but took a long time  especially dessert  Staff werent great and service charge was high  Drinks were good too 
R0143,Food was amazing  Staff were very friendly  Noise was a little loud  energetic   but lovely for Sunday brunch
R0143,Food was delicious and service was good however they put us under huge pressure to leave before we had even sat down  We had the table from 11 12 15  Our bill was produced without request at 11 55 and a waiter appeared at our table at 12 10 to ask us to leave  The feeling of pressure to eat up and get out took away from the overall experience but I highly recommend the food  Delish 
R0143,Food was excellent  service was prompt and discreet  House red is very nice
R0143,Food was fine but nothing special  I asked for scrambled egg instead of fried and was told the kitchen was �too busy to scramble eggs�  
R0143,Food was fine but nothing special Have been for dinner and really enjoyed it but brunch was disappointing overall 
R0143,Food was gorgeous  Good and quick service and a lovely atmosphere will definitely return 
R0143,Food was great but the service was terrible  Left waiting on menus  and had to ask for drinks multiple times after ordering  Also had to ask for the bill twice  Service certainly let the quality of food down 
R0143,Food was nice and a good choice on the menu  However  the 1 hour and 15 mins time limit on the tables is ridiculous    
R0143,Food was nice and a good choice on the menu  However  the 1 hour and 15 mins time limit on the tables is ridiculous    We were asked to vacate the table 4 times and hadnt even gone over the allocated time   Think its a bit overrated to be honest 
R0143,Food was nice  prices very over inflated  Cheesecake was over 10 euro  Whilst it was very nice its too highly priced  Food was good overall  Reataurant was very cold  uncomfortably so and we were very quickly asked to vacate table for next clients  I dont have an issue with this but it needs to be stated before hand and in this case wasnt 
R0143,Food was ok but I felt we were really rushed  Bill was brought to us without asking for it and food came out ridiculously quickly after ordering which tells me that very little is made to order there 
R0143,Food was OK  a little fussy  but good atmosphere  service was excellent and BYOB with no corkage is the best 
R0143,Food was very salty deeming our food inedible  Friendly staff  
R0143,Food was very salty deeming our food inedible  Friendly staff  Worst dining experience in a while  Wont return 
R0143,Food wasnt brilliant  was slightly cold  Service was abrupt  staff were not very helpful  and we were very rushed  Space is small  with the tables too squashed together  so much so that it is almost impossible to get out of your table  The ambience isnt great either  Not a great place to go if youre with friends and looking to spend a few hours together a catch up 
R0143,"Good food  however   
Tables are too tightly packed together  If there are two of you  be prepared not be able to hear what your friend has to say 
Meal sitting times are too strict  definitely a restaurant who is not afraid to advertise that they care about customer turnover rather than a good dining and social experience "
R0143,Good music  perfect food  reasonable prices  kind staff    If we knew about PHX before  we would not eat anywhere else in Dublin
R0143,Good pizza  and good pasta  Fresh mozzarella with tomato for a starter make you happy but still hungry  Then you can ask for extra thin pizza or supper creamy pasta with chicken  30 percent off voucher that they are giving for your next visit makes bill reasonable
R0143,good service and nice location  we were seated immediately and our order taken promptly  good value for city dining
R0143,Good service  Lemon dessert was unbelievable  Brunch tacos were slightly cold  however were still tasty 
R0143,Good  vibrant local spot  I was left waiting too long to be seated when I entered the restaurant which was disappointing and meant the experience was tainted from the outset 
R0143,Gorgeous food  Been dyin to try this place out for a while and it really didn disappoint  Pecan pie was just unreal 
R0143,Great ambience and very relaxed  Tasty food and good service  Did came quickly and all our requests were met  Would definitely return again 
R0143,Great atmosphere and delicious food  Will be returning 
R0143,Great atmosphere  Beautiful steak  Really enjoyed it 
R0143,Great breakfast and brunch menu to suit all tastes 
R0143,Great brunch spot 
R0143,Great central location  good food and cocktails selection  but very limited with sitting time a the table 
R0143,Great choice for curry in Dublin  Have eaten here a few times and its been consistently good  Great Saag Paneer and Lamb Balti will come back here again and again 
R0143,Great early bird   fab food   good gin cocktails  Really enjoyed it
R0143,Great food  and  super attentive staff  will be back  
R0143,Great food and amazing staff 
R0143,Great food and equally great service  Highly recommended 
R0143,Great food and even better service matched by the atmosphere  A must for brunch
R0143,Great food and great service  We went for Brunch and enjoyed every second of it
R0143,Great food and nice place  Different than the other places  Worth to see and try the very good food 
R0143,Great food and was able to get seated early in the morning and beat the rush  Was worth the trip out to the city to go to it 
R0143,Great food and would definitely recommend to others
R0143,Great food  slow service  Waiting >15 mins for bill  then 10 mins for card machine 
R0143,Great food  drinks and atmosphere but the staff are the stand out for me  Very professional  friendly and accommodating 
R0143,Great food  great service and really cool venue  Definetely going back 
R0143,Great food  service and atmosphere   A real keeper 
R0143,Great food; attentive service and comfortable surroundings
R0143,Great for brunch  Make a reservation because it gets crowded
R0143,Great restaurant and very understanding of our group being late 
R0143,Great Saturday brunch  Fresh food  big portions  Massive choice  book in advance   brunchofchampions
R0143,Great service and appreciate the attention to requests 
R0143,Great service and very very tasty food  The atmosphere was nice  good value as well 
R0143,Great service  beautiful food and drinks  Staff couldnt have been nicer  A lovely evening
R0143,Great service  great food  Busy on Sunday but once sat down  got well looked after   food came out really quickly and was very tasty
R0143,Great service  really reasonable price for some really high quality food  Will be recommending to anyone who will listen 
R0143,Great welcome  Fabulous service  Friendly staff throughout  Delicious food
R0143,Had a fantastic brunch with friends   great service and atmosphere  First visit of many I hope 
R0143,Had a gorgeous brunch a few weeks ago  Cant wait to go back  Had the french toast with bacon and maple syrup  it was to die for   
R0143,Had a great evening meal for a special occasion  Highly recommend the calamari  Delicious  The service is top class  Gavin and his team go above and beyond to ensure you are having the best food experience  A true restaurant experience  Well done to all 
R0143,Had a really tasty meal here before going to a show  Food was delicious and the staff were lovely 
R0143,Had a wonderful breakfast and coffee here  The atmosphere is lovely with a ton of books to choose from  The bathroom is extremely clean  and there are two  Highly recommend  would come here again in a heartbeat 
R0143,Had a wonderful time   food was fabulous and the service was great very friendly staff  Would highly recommend 
R0143,Had brunch at S Ls recently and was very good  Returned for dinner and was very disappointed  I wasnt too hungry and so wanted to order only a starter but was told that there is a minimum order of one main course each   all of which were a minimum of  Euro 27   despite the fact that i was also ordering wine and therefore bringing up the total 
R0143,Had brunch on saturday and could fault the food  it was delicious  Definitely recommend the cocopops french toast 
R0143,Had the coco pops French toast which was delicious  Staff were very friendly and attentive  Very enjoyable brunch and will definitely be back 
R0143,"Had the worst Italian dinner in Ireland  
The drinks were bad but above all their pasta was not eatable  

Mine was over cooked  no flavour and stuffed with garlic as an attempt to savour it  

We also order pasta pasta with sausage and this was so so so bad  First of all if you are putting sausages in your menu dont use chorizo  Chorizo is not sausage  If you are cooking Italian then use proper ingredients  The dish was so saulty and overall so bad then neither of us finished them  

I cant recommend this place for Italian food  perhaps they are good with meat but definitely stay away from anything that looks Italian on their menu "
R0143,Have heard great for brunch so tried for dinner  Staff were friendly but not attentive  drinks and starter orders took a long time to come  Had sardine bruschetta and hake gnocchi  Food was very ordinary and not very appetising  Big portions but too expensive for a overcoooked food  Bathroom view of kitchen was very cool 
R0143,"Hi 

I would like to issue a small complaint  

The food: the baked ham shouldnt be an item on the menu  its a very dissapointing dish to recieve when your expecting ""the brunch of champions""  its a plate of ham with eggs and hollandaise sauce  The couple beside me had the same after we had finished and they were also very dissapointed with the dish  

The service: We had nearly finished our meals by the time we recived our drinks 

Reservation: I recieved an email later tha day informing me that i had not arrived for my booking and that i should have informed someone that i couldnt arrive  

Sorry to be complaining  i just thought a restaurant which is regarded quite highly would have standards higher than this 

Thanks"
R0143,high expectations with the brunch reputation but it nowhere near lived up to this
R0143,high expectations with the brunch reputation but it nowhere near lived up to this based on the crab cakes and pork belly hash options we choose maybe try something else if theres a next time
R0143,High quality food  great service and reasonably priced    All in a very nice setting     Perfect  
R0143,"I actually really like this restaurant  the food is top notch  I wouldnt or couldnt fault it  
the major problem is the turn around time for the tables   weekend brunch only get 1hr 15mins for the table  and they practically throw you out of the place   bill is dropped to the table before its asked for  and then there are pointed looks from the staff to make you feel as uncomfortable as possible until you leave; I wont be going back   its not a relaxing experience at all "
R0143,I booked a table in advance  and received a call the day before to confirm that I would be attending on time  I confirmed that I would be there on time  and indeed we showed up 5 minutes early because the restaurant had a strict policy of not showing up late  When we arrived  we had to wait 10 minutes just standing by the bar even though there were 2 empty tables and another table finishing up  We had to give our names repeatedly because the man who was supposed to seat us couldnt remember our name  We were really disappointed that we booked well in advance  showed up on time  and yet werent seated on time  Clearly the restaurant is extremely disorganised  I will therefore never be going back  Id rather take my money to a restaurant where they do seat you on time 
R0143,I booked a table on 19th of November for a girls get together on the 9th of December at 12 30 anticipating the Christmas rush as there was 4 of us  The food was amazing however when we asked to see the desserts and coffee menu at 1 30pm we were told the bill was on the way because our server needed to flip the table    there wasnt even a q we were never advised the table would be needed back    Aside from this the food was gorgeous it was a pity all of our first experience here ended in this way  We appreciate its a busy period but 1 hour is not long enough to savour it 
R0143,"I booked brunch for a table of 3 last Sunday and had heard great reviews of the food  I was made aware  of the time limit of 1:15 for brunch  When I arrived the table wasnt ready so it was another 20mins standing by the door before I was seated as I saw the time on my phone  Food was great our waitress was lovely and good atmosphere  The restaurant emptied out towards the end of our meal and by the time our dishes were cleared we counted 6 empty tables for four all around us  There was no guests waiting to be seated  The waitress dropped the bill straight away and said apologetically that they needed table back  I mentioned that we were 20 mins delayed sitting down however we were happy to leave  The manager arrived over and pointed several times to his iPad announcing that ""its all digital you were seated at 12:17"" rather than my 12:20 estimate  While I understand the policy it was ridiculous to be told over and over that it was ""all digital"" when the place was half empty and we would have had a coffee while paying the bill thus spending more money  I was not querying the use of technology rather the  basics of customer service  Bit of an uncomfortable end to an otherwise lovely meal "
R0143,I came here for Sunday brunch  1:30pm   This place is very trendy and trying so  so hard   Unfortunately  the food is just okay   really nothing special  Their mains are  for the most part  good value but their brunch cocktails hardly justify their ticket price  The service was soulless and when we hit our time limit for the table at 2:45  they book ending times for reservations   quite tacky   we were certainly made aware of it  Despite there being a sea of empty tables  our waitress abruptly brought our bill and pushed us to settle up  Sadly  the last ten minutes here left a sour taste in my mouth  There are plenty of other restaurants nearby who wouldnt rush their clients out the door so I wont be rushing back 
R0143,I came here with my friend for our annual Christmas dinner and it was absolutely awful The service was outrageous 
R0143,It took over an hour for us to get our main course and we never got so much as an apology  The service was outrageous 
R0143,16 Euro  which Is crazy amount and that was cheapist dish on Brunch  the eggs were not hot enough  and the dish was out of proportion and lacked flavour  Staff were friendly but just the food let it down for me
R0143,I felt the food was very overpriced for the quality of it  well for my Avocado and toast 
R0143,I found food v salty and over flavoured  The price of a steak at 38 e is just too much  Overall disappointed 
R0143,I found for what I got it was far too expensive   calamari starter was a joke 3 small pieces on a bed of salad the calamari was tasteless    the pasta ragu dish was tasty but at 20 Euro  not worth the price   I asked the waitress for Parmesan but she never bothered to come back   
R0143,I got laid after going to this place on Friday night  WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
R0143,I had the avocado on toast with a side of duck fat chips which were both delicious  Generous portions and cooked to perfection  Highly recommend
R0143,I have been here s few times most recently for my husbands birthday when we were given two glasses of presseco for the occasion and the experience was great  Not this time  Despite putting in our booking that my friend is as celebrating her 50th that night no presecvo was forthcoming so I asked for a desert  We got s lemon desert and a candle and were duly charged for it along with TWO bottles of wine   we only had one  The bill was amended ni problem when we pointed out the extra wine but desert was left on as we were told its not their policy to do anything g for birthdays by a young waitress 
R0143,Wont be going again  Very disappointing after the last lovely visit for husbands birthday
R0143,I have eaten here before a couple of years ago and so I made the suggestion to my husband and parents to eat here before a show  I was disappointed with the food  it really was only ok 
R0143,I heard it was one of the best brunches in Dublin  this is not the case in my opinion  The service was really bad  the restaurant was not full  in fact there was only 4 5 other tables  but we were completely rushed  the food arrived very fast and after about 40 mins of being in the restaurant we were handed the bill and told there was no rush  Will not be going back
R0143,I just love this place it does simple and tasty food
R0143,I know they declare that you can only have the table for 1 hour 15 mins for a brunch booking on the website  which honestly is pretty tight if you want to actually enjoy your food and soak up the atmosphere  never mind order dessert which proved impossible  so you could say we knew what we were getting into  But when the 3 of us were chatting with freshly poured glasses of prosecco from the bottle we had ordered withe our food and the waitress comes over and puts the unasked for bill on the table  saying they need it back after only an hour and 5 mins since our booking time began  we were all gobsmacked  It immediately soured the whole experience and turned the conversation to the question of value for money  considering an already tight time slot even before they try shoo you out early  how are you supposed to relax and enjoy the place or order dessert  which we were never even offered when the plates were cleared or before we were presented with the bill and our marching orders   I dont usually write reviews but this annoyed us all so much and really marred the experience  We took our dessert orders to Mooch instead to finish the conversation we were having 
R0143,"I opted for the Beefeater Burger  as it was the burger the place is known for and you cant go wrong ordering the classic  When the burger arrived  it did look pretty good; it came in between a toasted bun  with double jack cheddar cheese  sauteed onions  pickles  and a combination of ketchup  mustard  and  retro sauce and served with rustic style fries  The burger did taste nice and the toppings work well with the beef  however I found my bun to be overly toasted and my portion of chips didnt reflect what everyone else was served  which I wasnt too happy about �
I hate to say it  but unfortunately I wasnt overly impressed with the burger  I was expecting to eat one of the top three burgers in Dublin  it just didnt cut it for me  This is not to say the burger wasnt good  but I found the beef was just too plain so it just fell short of the high expectations I was told about  I would not like to go back and give a second chance"
R0143,I really enjoyed the food here Early bird is grrat value and the service is very friendly 
R0143,Wine overpriced  I dont think I will go back
R0143,I think I am a bit disappointed with this place  Starting with service   slow  not up to the standard of an italian restaurant with new yorker style at all  In terms of food  pasta was just ok  The money it costed   definitely not worth the taste  
R0143,"I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner  really attentive service and a fantastic meal 
Lovely evening and it made for a memorable birthday "
R0143,I walked in with my groupon voucher and the waitress wasnt particularly friendly And she was talking as eating with food in her mouth  A little rude to me i thought 
R0143,I was in here on saturday evening  Food was lovely  It was very busy and seemed not enough staff on    We didnt get our drinks and no one checked to see if all ok for the duration of our meal  Felt a bit overcrowded  Will go back but perhaps not on a saturday 
R0143,I was rather disappointed  I have eaten here before a couple of years ago and so I made the suggestion to my husband and parents to eat here before a show  I was disappointed with the food  it really was only ok 
R0143,I was very disappointed with my experience  The seats are very packed together and the food was mediocre at best  I had eaten here previously and was very impressed but on this occasion I was left very disappointed which is a shame as I had really being looking forward to eating there again  I dont think I will venture back for a third time 
R0143,"I was very disappointed with my main course  My cod was completely overcooked 
Dessert was very nice "
R0143,"I went for the Sunday Brunch and it wasnt what I expected  
The music was horrible : Missy Elliot  Club Dancing music  old school rap music    so not appropriate for brunch  You feel like youve just entered in a cheap club    but at breakfast time  Oh and the staff was playing with the music volume  they couldnt figure out the right volume  so you would sometimes have super loud music and then low volume music    Also  the food was okay  I guess  I got the frittata and my friend got the Crab Cake plate  not to die for honestly  I feel like San Lorenzo is trying to have all the typical brunch menu  but it isnt appropriate at all because they dont focus on one really good taste: theyre just having a diversity of low quality exotic meals   Theyre supposed to be a Modern Italian  New York Style Restaurant but there is nothing Italian and even less New York Style  They should try to focus on one style instead of 20  

Dont go there "
R0143,"Theyre supposed to be a Modern Italian  New York Style Restaurant but there is nothing Italian and even less New York Style  They should try to focus on one style instead of 20  

Dont go there "
R0143,I would not choose to eat here again  neither of our meals was very good   
R0143, Extremely disappointed
R0143," had the pasta with butternut squash and broccoli  my friend had the Spaghetti with Vongole  My pasta was overcooked and under seasoned and a real disappointment  The spaghetti arrived and looked like a half portion  at  Euro 22 95 for a plate of pasta it should have been perfection  It was also overcooked and bland  We shared dessert which was nice but when we asked for the bill we had been overcharged  
"
R0143,Id heard so much about the food here that expectations were high  Both my friend and I have spent a lot of time in Italy and were looking forward to our meal  Our starter of Antipasto was only sliced meats with a few olives and the cheeses and vegetables were missed 
R0143,Ive been for brunch a number of times and have really enjoyed it  but this time was not good  The food wasnt as good as usual  the alcoholic drinks were too strong  they were nearly undrinkable   and the service was extremely slow  normally its so fast   I had brought 3 friends  telling them that it was the best place for brunch  and we were all quite disappointed  I dont know if/when Ill be risking going again 
R0143,Ive been here many times and always enjoy the food and buzz  However on this recent occasion I was very disappointed with the service  Although the table was booked a long time in advance we were left too long waiting  Previous guests should be asked to vacate their table  I also found the service to be cold; they would not take a small cake to bring out for a special occasion  I know this was very strange to the older people I was with   in their words seevice are not what it used to be  Loved the food as always anyway 
R0143,If you want to loose your money  go ahead    
R0143,Incredible service and food  Will definitely be back 
R0143,Incredible  creative brunch food   would recommend booking in advance as there was a queue out the door for the Brunch of Champions 
R0143,It can be difficult to get a high quality breakfast in Dublin but this place knocks it out of the park 
R0143,It was fabulous  The brunch menu was delicious and all the staff friendly and welcoming  Definitely going back as soon as possible   highly recommended 
R0143,"It was when my brekfast sandwich arrived that the cracks began to show and all was not as it seemed in Lovely food land  The sausages were a horrible rubbery consistency that had evidently been pre cooked and stored in the fridge  the accompanying home fries were another pre cooked failure from the fridge which although they had some nice flavour were inedible for me thanks to a cold  half cooked mushiness  To cap it all off  a soggy tomato soaked through the bread which would have been the only redeeming feature �of this travesty 

The accompanying instantly forgettable coffee brought the price to over  Euro 10  Maybe they can do better with lunch or dinner but I certainly wont be tempted back to find out "
R0143, The waitress wasnt helpful and after an hour she asked us to leave as she needed the table  When we came over nobody mention anything about the time  
R0143,I dont think I will go back 
R0143,Limited selection on menu and not very accommodating for birthdays  Disappointing 
R0143,Love this place  The cheesecake is unreal 
R0143,Loved the brunch options  Its a fun system for a Sunday brunch out in the city  Even the view from the bathroom into the kitchen was fun 
R0143,Loved this place  Really fun great atmosphere for brunch 
R0143,Lovely brunch  Brunch tacos  with jerk chicken  were fantastic 
R0143,Lovely evening with a pal  service discreet but efficient    chicken parmigiana to die for   
R0143,"Lovely food  and  great service    the loveliest Chocolate baked cheesecake 
Well recommended for a good night out with friends"
R0143,Lovely food  but a pity about the service   We had a table booked for 11:45  we received an email and phone call to say we had the table for 1 hour and 15 minutes which was fine   Our two guests arrived first and immediately were asked to ring us to see were we stuck in traffic   We were a total of five minutes late   It felt very rushed and unfortunately was not the nicest of experiences  we didnt feel our business was appreciated 
R0143,lovely place  staff very good  selection of  red wine by the glass very poor  desserts too heavy  main courses very good
R0143,Lovely staff  nice food  great music  Lots of choices on menu 
R0143,"Lovely staff  very welcoming 
Food great with generous portions 
Loved the tiramisu"
R0143,Maasively overpriced food and wine 
R0143,Entry level wine starts at about  Euro 30 which is far too expensive considering its not even that great  Service is shoddy at best  Staff werent very friendly and completely inattentive  I could go on but it would be more of the same  On a plus note  the food is good  not great  but good 
R0143,Made a reservation for Sunday brunch   It was so good we came back for Monday brunch   Great food   Great service   Great ambiance 
R0143,Met up with some old work friends and felt rushed from the get go did not like this feeling I understand its a 1hour 15min to e on the table but we were seated late and felt like they wanted us in and out 
R0143,My  1 for Sunday brunch
R0143,"My granny travelled from Thurles and my mother from Kildare on Easter Sunday so we could enjoy a family get together with myself and my husband 
I booked this place because my 3 other visits had been so nice and I knew the deserts would be a real after lunch treat for Easter Sunday 
First up I would like to say that the food was lovely and the waiter that served us was good 
However  my mother asked the passing waitress don t know her name  she was wearing a grey top  during our meal if she would mind turning down the music a bit as it was affecting my granny and quite frankly our whole group  She was simply and firmly told No  we always have it that loud  it cant be turned down  With that she walked away  I was so angry we asked for the bill and left  I was embarassed that I invited my family up to enjoy a family treat to be rudely disregarded with a simple request  The music has never been that loud the other times Ive been there so I refuse to believe it couldnt have been adjusted a bit to make it a bit more comfortable  Both my granny and I have very slight hearing problems but couldnt hear each other speak because of the noise  Needless to say we didnt stay for coffee and desert and I will be very slow to return to or recommend your restaurant any more  We ended up only being in your establishment for 45minutes because of the noise and rudeness of that waitress and it ruined the first Easter lunch Ive had with family in years "
R0143,"My husband and I came for the brunch after hearing amazing things  We were both very disappointed  The French toast was dry and the pork was flavorless  The home fried potatoes tasted as if theyd been microwaved  Cold and chewy  
The service was too rushed  We sat down at 10:30am and had the bill on the table at 11:05  
Wont be returning "
R0143,My only issues are �is that the burger bun is often soggy when served and the waiting time is a bit long 
R0143,"My partner and I were recommended to try this joint  however  we dont understand what there is to like about this place apart from the service and ambience  The food was highly disappointing and not cheap  We ordered the:

x million dollar fries  it was the best thing we ordered  Crispy on the outside and soft creamy potato on the inside  but a bit too salty
x spinach and garlic side  very bland and couldnt taste any hint of garlic
x cheesy cauliflower  Ive had better
x flank steak  very chewy even at medium rare 
x rump steak  very dry
x tarragon red wine garlic butter  this came directly under the ""sauce"" heading  You can imagine our disappointment when it came in a stick of butter "
R0143,Nice bustle in the restaurant  warm and cosy  Steak was well cooked  the jus was nice but overpriced  The desserts were far too sweet  Bread and butter pudding is sweet but with cr�me anglaise  cherry ice cream  and cherry syrup I couldnt finish it   Simple vanilla would be better  The white wine  staff recommendation on the menu  was mid range price but seemed like a cheap bottle  For probably the first time ever the bottle was not finished  Pity 
R0143,"Nice place to eat with cool vibe 
will go back"
R0143,Nice restaurant and food but speed of service too fast
R0143,Not my first time and definitely not my last  Very reasonable prices  delicious food and efficient service 
R0143,One of the most fantastic food and wine experiences weve ever had  And the staff was so professional and friendly 
R0143,"Our Table was not ready when we arrived  While we were asked if we wanted a drink while we waited it was a further 10mins before we were again asked and served the drinks  There was no where to sit while we waited with our drinks 

My starter of New England chowder was overly salted 
My wifes starter was adaquate if bland 
My main course of Porchetta was dry  Because my started was so salty my pallet was unable to distinguish any of the flavours in this dish 
My wifes comment on her main  COD  likened it to baby food  

We were so close to the table beside us that by the time we left I felt that we had intruded in their conversation 

We were both very disappointed with this restaurant and did not see any justification for the prices being charged "
R0143,There was no where to sit while we waited with our drinks 
R0143,Our waiter was really nice  he looked after us very well with his bubbly personality  Thank you
R0143,Our waiter was really nice  he looked after us very well with his bubbly personality  Thank you  
R0143,Our waitress was really nice  quick  and attentive  Also  a great conversationalist 
R0143,Outstanding food and the steak was amazing   Just loved it
R0143,Over priced wIne     small portions    good cheese cake  
R0143,Over rated hate the cages decor Felt squashed and rushed 
R0143,Queue was out the door which added to the cramped feeling
R0143,Overall I was disappointed with this restaurant as I have heard so many positive things about if previously  The lamb was extremely fatty and the potatoes were cold and the pork was also extremely fatty  Everything on the menu was extremely over priced  However the staff were all  very friendly and the dessert was lovely which was the Nutella cheesecake  Overall  I would not recommend this restaurant as  the food isnt great and it is extremely over priced 
R0143,Overpriced food in a cramped space filled with pretentious  entitled upper middle class snobs 
R0143,Perfect Brunch  Always love eating in here as you know youre going to receive tasty satiating food  and walk away happy 
R0143,Pre theatre menu is great value  food was super and service was perfect 
R0143,Really delicious food  fast and friendly service and good atmosphere 
R0143,Really enjoyed the whole experience from the welcome to the food to the decor and the bathrooms  Will be going back again 
R0143,Really good food and drinks and great service from very friendly staff 
R0143,Really good food and lively atmosphere  Love the decor as well
R0143,Really good service  but food wasnt great  Prawns  scallops and fish over cooked  which was very disappointing  Pricy for the quality of food
R0143,Really tasty food in a great decor venue
R0143,Really yummy food and great menu  Staff are so friendly  Cant wait to come again and try something different
R0143,Restaurant was amazing for a Birthday treat to my girlfriend  we flew in from London and have to say it was well worth the trip
R0143,Rush in rush out booked for six was handed dessert menu at 6 35   food nothing great   Staff huddled at top at bar waiting for you to stop    No relaxing at all  No fun  Would of being better off staying in   Very disappointed with everything that we just upped and left  
R0143,WILL NOT BE RETURNING  
R0143,This place in my opinion is place to drop by for a bite on a night out and not a place to centre your night out around  The ambiance was very slap dash with a feeling of eat and get out with tables and chairs reminiscent of school 
R0143,The slot allocations  while well warned  are very restrictive to enjoying a casual lunch with friends  I wont be back as I think dont think the food has anything additional to offer to other places where the atmosphere is much more relaxed 
R0143,Second visit  Food good  Service good  Expensive for what it is 
R0143,Again not bad  but not the standard I was expecting 
R0143,service was amazing but the food was fairly standard and so expensive for what you were getting  people were raving about the nutella cheesecake     not bad  but it all tasted like its from a packet or if it is made fresh it had been frozen  it doesnt taste or feel like its freshly prepared taste and texture wise  Again not bad  but not the standard I was expecting 
R0143,Service was brilliant and food was fab too   will definitely be going back
R0143,Service was friendly and efficient  Lively spot more suited to young crowd as music is loud  Tables are comfortable 
R0143,Some of our food was reheated  some was cooked fresh  Very disappointed to be served reheated food  it was rock hard  Service was excellent but could not make up for the awful food 
R0143,Staff was amazing  friendly and new the menu well  Our waitress  think from Latvia  was hilarious 
R0143,"Superb restaurant  excellent service  quality food   I had the early bird and food was top quality 

A must visit"
R0143,Thanks for a lovely evening  Food was delicious  Thanks for the birthday candle and song  Will definitely come back 
R0143,"The best Brunch Ive ever had  Lovely place to spend our Valentines day 
For sure I will be back to eat that French Toast once more "
R0143,The food is always amazing  service just perfect  a litle noise but super vibrante and modern envoriment
R0143,The food is ok   Ive no real complaints  but no stellar praise either Unfortunately  no matter how busy or quiet they are Ive always found the service very slow   there are just too many tables squashed in here for staff to get around quick enough I feel 
R0143,The food was awesome  however we got more or less kicked out of the restaurant after 1 hour  I know on their website it says that for brunch reservations you have 1h15min time to eat  but as soon as we had finished our meals they brought the bill  Once we had paid they even came to us telling that the next reservation for this table was waiting  only after 1h of sitting there    In addition to that they had put a service charge of 12 5 percent to our bill although we were only 5 persons  So in total  it is already short to only be allowed sitting there for 1h15  but then being asked out after only an hour was pretty rude  I would not go there again  because it is just not enough time to enjoy the brunch if you have to hurry eating 
R0143,The food was awful   3 out of 4 dishes were very poor  Sardines were on soggy bread  swordfish was hard 
R0143,Asked for fries and was given potato cubes and told that how you do fries  Gambas were good  rigatoni with sausage wasnt edible as sauce and sausage were near burnt  Service was so so  under staffed I would say  For prices paid  this was not value  Also  our 2 person table was too close to the tables beside us where their/our conversations were within earshot of each other  V disappointed as we chose this place for a special occasion 
R0143,Glad I didnt order the poached eggs which were piled in a bowl waiting to be served  Disgusting  I rather wait a bit to get a FRESH meal than getting terrible  pre cooked and reheated rubbish  Never again 
R0143,The food was awful  All dripping and soaked with oil probably to hide the fact that it was over cooked and dry  We both didnt like any of it  Bacon hard and dry  nothing seasoned  roesti must have been on the pan for hours  couldnt cut through the asparagus   altogether a waste of money  Also   you can see down into the kitchen from the bathroom sink and it really took my appetite 
R0143,The food was delicious    The staff were great  Especially the manager  I will definitely be back again 
R0143,The food was delicious and service was very good   Really nice place with a fun atmosphere 
R0143,The food was good but the service wasnt great  We had a prebooked table but it took ten minutes for us to be seated  Aside from taking our order and delivering/removing the table we had no interaction with the staff  We tried to get their attention for 20 minutes to ask for a water refill but eventually gave up  It took us another 20 minutes to get someones attention for the bill  I realise it is a very busy spot but there were lots of staff on yet the service to customers was lacking 
R0143,The food was good  but the restaurant was very noisy  even difficult to hear the waiters questions at times  I believe this is because they have packed in as many tables as possible to increase footfall  which also meant you were practically sitting on top of the people next to you 
R0143,The food was great  but the service was not good  The waitress was stressed because friends arrived 15 min late  and told us we can maximum have the table for 1 hour 15 min total  Thats a very short time for brunch  but fair enough   however you can say that in a better way and make it clear when making the reservation  She was rude when telling friends that she would not accept any more orders  We were paying customers  and I believe you can solve most things by simply being nice  I would recommend it for the food  but not for the service  not for the 1 hour 15 min you have to stress through brunch with friends 
R0143,The food was incredible and great value for money alongside very friendly staff   could eat here again and again
R0143,"The food was nice  however the service was not great  when we ordered our meal initially it was the only time they asked us what food did we want  even though we had informed them we wanted to order dessert after we had finished our main meal as a few of the girls were not getting starters and decided to get desserts instead  They never came back over to us nor did they inform us that the kitchen was closed  they didnt even ask us did we want coffee or tea after the meal  

Due to that I would be extremely hard pushed to go back due to the price and service  The food was nice however the lack of customer service let it down  I dont like restaurants who bombard you every five minutes  but I dont like the feeling that the customer has to be pushy in order to get the full experience of what the restaurant has to offer  

Dont get me wrong the service we did get was nice  the person who showed us to our table and took our order was very friendly  but it was a disappointment when they never came back to us and we even tried a few times to get the bill and the restaurant wasnt busy due to the bus strike  

I was really looking forward to this restaurant as I had heard great reviews from it in work but I was very disappointed when I left  if it wasnt for that  I would be raving about it  yet I cant hide the fact that this experience tarnished the restaurant in my eyes and I would be hard pushed to go back considering there are many other restaurants in Dublin to try "
R0143,The food was subpar with a very limited menu  For a restaurant that advertised themselves as Italian the menu only had 3 pasta dishes that did not resemble anything that I would have considered traditional Italian  The owner and/or manager of the restaurant did ask how our meal was and after expressing our unhappiness with the meal instead of just doing something to attempt to right it  she offered us more food and waited for my husband to leave the table to ask about the service  which I found childish  The service from the front of the house staff was great but everything else lacked  There are much better places to eat and enjoy a bottle of wine and cocktails with twice the ambience around Dublin for the same price 
R0143,The food was yummy but the service was fantastic  Our waiter was very friendly and always attentive  We had a great meal 
R0143,The menu is extremely limited  The main course portions especially the Cannelloni are far too small  They need a lot more choice on the menu  its an Italian restaurant but has very few classic Italian meals  I wouldnt recommend to a friend 
R0143,The noodles were bland and dry  Some of the rice was under cooked  The food was also cold  I was disappointed 
R0143,The restaurant has such a great buzzing atmosphere  The staff were so friendly and the food was just out of this world  Cant wait to go back
R0143,The restaurant is really nice but we waited at the bar for quite some time even though we had a reservation  Ruined it for us 
R0143,We were like ten people crushed in the entrance it was really uncomfortable and ruined the romantic mood  The music was insanely loud for a romantic atmosphere  I literally couldnt speak with my date  Ruined it for us 
R0143,The Ice cream was very nice  I cant say the same for the 2nd 2 drinks we ordered  as they never came  We mentioned this to another waiter who apologized but then when we asked our waitress for our bill she totally forgot to bring it to us so we got up and paid at the bar She had passed our table 3 times after we asked for the bill It was the same waiter that apologized when we told him we had been waiting for our bill  Very disappointing  
R0143,The restaurant itself is very nice  except how very very close the tables for 2 are to each other  We went for the early bird menu My Caprese was very nice but at an addition charged of 2 95 the gambas for 3 prawns that you had to peel yourself wasnt work the money or effort involved My hake was so over cooked and my husbands chicken breast saltimbocca was also dry and it hadnt any sage that had been in the description and just 2 baby potatoes  The cheesecake also had a 2 95 additional charge 
R0143,The service was absolutely dreadful  It took an hour to serve us our starters  we had to ask a different waiter to take our drink orders because our waitress didnt tend to the table and we had to eventually pay at the bar because after 15 minutes the waitress still hadnt come back to the table having given us the bill 
R0143,The food is nice but over priced 
R0143,The service was excellent but overall was not good value for money   The prawn starter in the early bird only had 3 prawns and was 3 Euro  extra   The early bird being of moderate value at 21 95  ended up being 34 Euro  with all the added extra   The restaurant was also very noise and tables were packed in   Had high hopes but left extremely disappointed 
R0143,The service was great  But food just average  I would prefer just have a drink at here  Recommend for their dessert 
R0143,The service was ridiculously bad 
R0143,The food took ages to get to the table  I had to ask the staff multiple time where the food was  If I had not been starving  I would have walked out   When the food finally got to the table  I found it to be downright terrible and cheap  The dessert was actually stomach turning  When I tried to say something to the management they were very rude  Overall Id never come back here again 
R0143,The staff was rude since the booking call   The food is grease and overpriced
R0143,"The service was prompt and polite and the atmosphere is good  the place is very pleasant and lively  While my colleagues meal was fine and looked well  my brunch of champions was over cooked and dry  The potato rosti  sausage and black pudding looked like they had been reheated  They were dried out and chewy 

The restaurant was busy so it was hard to get the attention of any of the waiting staff  My friend cleared their plate  I left a large portion of my meal uneaten  The waitress who cleared our plates made no comment   I had to point out that the rosti etc were too hard and dry to eat  She said she would speak to the chef  but I didnt hear anything further  

Another waitress  the 3rd person to serve us  brought the bill  I paid it in full in cash  As I departed we encountered the manager who asked if we had enjoyed our meal   I said that I hadnt  He offered to refund my meal  but I declined as I was almost out the door at that stage 

While my friend really enjoyed their meal  I didnt   Perhaps it was just bad luck but I dont think I go back to chance my luck again   there are far better and less costly breakfasts to be had elsewhere   and you dont get called beforehand to make sure you are going to show up "
R0143,The waitress   Kris  was absolutely outstanding  Amazing service 
R0143,This afternoon I thought I would have brunch in a different place than my usual haunts and I skipped over for the eggs benedict which is my favourite as I had known they made this from my last visit here
R0143,This is a very busy spot  popular with students   Food was good as it usually is  the student deal is great 2 mains for the price of one  and cheap drinks also  bit disappointed with the service  but at the same time it is a busy spot and maybe they were short staffed  Would recommend the Frenchie burger 
R0143,this was my first time to eat here The two of us ordered the same lunch special_jerk chicken My companion sent her dish back immediately as the salad leaves on hers were not fresh This was quickly replaced I found my dish disappointing both taste wise and in its presentation The chicken pieces were quite small and the dressing sparse We ordered ice cream which was fine but again it was not well presented We were charged for an extra coffee we didnt have but decided not to mention it as we had to leave  I had been looking forward to my visit but I am reluctant to return 
R0143,This was my second visit to for dinner and the service was efficient and friendly  Food was excellent and the post dinner Baileys Coffee was just gorgeous  can highly recommend for good food and ambiance 
R0143,Thoroughly enjoyed  food delicious and service pleasant and respectful  Would highly recommend
R0143,Unexpectedly delightful Italian restaurant in the heart of Dublin  Great food and ambiance  Cheerful and attentive servers  Highly recommend 
R0143,Unfortunately  the least pleasurable meal we had during 2 weeks in Ireland was at the Kingfisher  Not terrible  but the chicken breast was very dry and the mackerel uninteresting  at best  Moderate prices were the most redeeming characteristic 
R0143,Unfriendly staff  one persons food came out wrong by the time it came out again the rest of the table were almost finished  Side order didnt come 
R0143,"Very accommodating for someone with a 
shellfish allergy   Alternatives were suggested which was great   Will be back   "
R0143,very average  been here three times now and have always come away feeling underwhelmed
R0143,"Very bad value  Bill had to be corrected for twice      and we were only two people
Will not be recommending"
R0143,Very big portions  Coco pops French toast is a must 
R0143,Very good atmosphere  attentive quick service  far too cramped though  french toast too greasy and no pecan pie on menu for 2nd time    Very annoying
R0143,Very friendly personal  Food is tasty and good portions  Desserts are awesome  Good place for having a weekend brunch 
R0143,very good all round   second night in dublin we ate here and couldnt fault it  would return
R0143,Very good food  a great ambience and friendly staff  would definitely recommend it to anyone 
R0143,Very mediocre brunch   baked ham was not baked but synthetic   no flavour   Poetion sizes far too large   Good coffee   we shall not return
R0143,Very nice place for a good meal  The service is very nice and the food tasted great  A great add to a nice trip to Dublin  
R0143,Very nice twixmas brunch  Friendly service  Excellent menu choices 
R0143,Was recommended to us by a friend from Dublin  Fantastic food reasonably priced in a nice setting 
R0143,We ate here to try the Himalayan Salt Aged Steak and I can highly recommend this restaurant  th e food was really so good that we are going back again this weekend  It was pricey but so worth it and the staff could not have been more helpful or friendlier 
R0143,We booked a table for 5 a few weeks in advance  I received a phone call on the morning of the dinner to confirm our booking of 5   When we arrived at the restaurant we were squeezed into a table for 4   One of our party had to sit sideways at the table  the staff would not give us a bigger table   This was very disappointing 
R0143,We booked a table for 5 a few weeks in advance  but upon arrival we were told that no booking was made in our name  Very unprofessional
R0143,"We booked in advance but were left at a really poor table right beside the main door where every time the door opened we were being blasted with freezing air or being hit with the actual door  
My husbands brunch dish was completely wrong and when his frittata finally arrive it was literally an omelette thrown on a plate  
The serve did remove the charge when we went to pay for the bill  which was fair of them  
We have eaten in heremany times for brunch and usually enjoy it thoroughly but this occasion was a let down "
R0143,"We booked the brunch of champions in this restaurant for a girls catch up and were left hugely disappointed by both the quality of food and service 

The food itself was below average  Ive had other meals here and was massively let down by this  It was room tempature  served a different times and had little to no taste 

The experience itself was rather stressful and we were reminded how long we had the table for several times  which led to everyone feeling tense  and almost thrown the bill 5 minutes before our time was up 

Im usually a big fan of this establishment but this left a really bad taste in my mouth "
R0143,We both enjoyed our evening   food  service and atmosphere were all faultless  
R0143,"We couldnt get a reservation here for the evening so we thought wed try dublins famous brunch instead and we were not disappointed  One of the staff called me and directed me to the restaurant as I was lost too 
We tried the breakfast tacos and crab cakes  both beautifully presented and delicious  Great staff and atmosphere  Highly recommend if you are in dublin for the weekend  Just disappointed we didnt get a chance for dinner   "
R0143,We enjoyed a family brunch here on Sunday morning and we will definitely be back
R0143,We got a set menu for lunch  It was absolutely delicious  We thoroughly enjoyed it and cant wait to return in the near future 
R0143,We got our bill as soon as we had finished the food without asking for it  This was after not even being there for an hour  When we came in we also got told that they were losing a customer because we had booked a table for four and there was only three of us  I had left a message under my booking that there was only 3 of us as i did not get the option to book for the required number but only for four   We would have been happy with getting a table for 2 and an extra chair Very bad customer service/business model  Food was good enough 
R0143,We had a fab2nd date here  Food was great atmosphere was buzzing and our waitress Kristine was just gorgeous   Perfect night  
R0143,We had a fabulous brunch here with great service  the crab cakes and asparagus in particular were amazing  would definitely recommend
R0143,We had the brunch tacos  coco pop French toast  and the Nutella cheesecake  All were delicious 
R0143,We waited a bit more than an hour for the food  which was the only annoying part  Rest all ok 
R0143,We went for brunch on a Saturday and it was incredible  The crab cakes were amazing  Great atmosphere as well  It was completely packed so booking essential I would say
R0143,We were asked to leave the table after 75 minutes  No warning of this 75 minute booking rule for brunch when we booked/ made the reservation   Other tables were not asked to leave despite being there longer than us  We were not drinking alcohol and expect this is why we were asked to leave  We were actually going to order wine before the waiter informed us we had to vacate the table  We then went Elsewhere for  a drink  Odd rule but seems to only apply to those who are not drinking cocktails 
R0143,We were here on Saturday for the early bird  Food was delicious with lovely wine  Service was friendly and attentive  Will be back 
R0143,We were looking forward to eating here for so long      and left the restaurant really disappointed  While the ambience was lively the food is completely over rated  Both meals lacked flavour and were below average 
R0143,Felt it was over priced for what we got      no problem paying for meals that are actually worth the money  Will be advising friends to avail of brunch from their local caf  
R0143,We were rushed out of the door after 1 hour and ten minutes
R0143,We were very impressed with the staff  specially the manager Gavin  The food was delicious and we will most definitely come back 
R0143,Weve been here loads of times and its normally quite good  However if this had been my first time there I wouldnt have gone back  We ordered two vege options  a side of beans and a side of potato cubes  The beans had bacon in them     granted perhaps we should have known Boston Beans had bacon but ordering two vege meals I think it should have been flagged  Also the potatos tasted like dirty oil and were inedible  We didnt touch either side  bar one piece of potato  and the waitress didnt even query it  Makes me think this happens alot as a normal restaurant generally queries full dishes returned  The waitress was very nice but I thought this service was a poor reflection 
R0143,"Went for brunch for first time  We loved it  Going back pretty soon with other friends 
Staff was very friendly and food was yummy "
R0143,Went for brunch on New Years Eve  service was so quick  We had our food before oureturning coffees   Food was so good  will definitely be back 
R0143,What a fantastic place to go for Brunch  Delicious food  excellent and friendly service   amazing cocktails 
R0143,"When I phoned on Monday to make a reservation  I told them I had a voucher  I had the ad from the Irish times  I was advised to book online  I booked online   When I arrived on Tuesday for lunch  I realised the advice I had been given was wrong  It left me in an embarrassing situation with my friend  I had been to the restaurant a few times before  but with the way I was treated on Tuesday I would be very reluctant to return  
Two gentlemen at the table beside me had the same problem with their Irish times ad  they got up and left "
R0143,When its worth taking out  your phone to photograph the food     Its a very good sign  And the taste test didnt disappoint  Well be back soon 
R0143,While some of our group thought the meal was ok   the majority where unhappy with their meal  a visit to our local takeaway on the way home is not a good sign   The level of customer service was very low   they did not include a  Euro 30 bottle of wine on the bill and when we kindly brought it to the attention of staff she did not seem too bothered by our gesture  Plenty of nicer restaurants in Dublin with better staff   atmosphere and food  Am raging because I had heard some good reviews and had recommended this place to our group 
R0143,While the service was good   our waitress was friendly and service was really fast  I was really disappointed in the food  Very basic  I thought it was thrown together and to be honest Ive had nicer food in a garage deli  I thought maybe it was my choice in meal but spoke with friends who had been and they said the same thing  Sorry for the poor review but felt really disappointed 
R0143,Will definitely be going back  customer service impeccable and food delish  Thanks so much 
R0143,Wonderful as always   Great food and great service   Delicious cocktails   Will be back 
R0143,Wonderful food and friendly efficient service  Best brunch in Dublin 
R0143,Wonderful food  staff were lovely and air conditioning on a very warm evening was perfect 
R0143,Would highly recommend this restaurant   Steak was amazing and so were the potatoes done in duck fat   the best ever   Had requested a good table when booking  and  also had mentioned it was my daughters birthday   they remembered both   great service
R0144, I absolutely love steak but I dont know if I can justify the price because for me it was no better than any other steak for comparison sake  Their sides are delicious though  the crispy onions and fries but I would hold off visiting unless its a very special occasion  The dining room is also lacking slightly in atmosphere but I blame the layout  
R0144,"4 95 for a hot drink and pastry deal in city centre is great value  Staff are the best around 

Have made this my regular coffee stop"
R0144,Although somewhat limited  the vegan options here are delicious  I ordered the vegan box for delivery and was not disappointed 
R0144,Ate here a number of years ago and thought it was a fabulous fine dining experience   what a disappointment to go back and find that the superb room is now the breakfast room and the dining room is now squashed in to the old library with basically a bar menu to choose from 
R0144,"Cute little place  A bit tucked away but very nice  sleek interior  We were just there for drinks but they have a complete food menu as well  which is apparently Italian     They have an extensive drinks menu with a focus on cocktails  I got a pint of the Sierra Nevada pale ale  but was admiring the cocktail list as well  definitely interested in the Lychee and Chilli martini and the Bramble for another time  
The bathroom was interestingly decorated but clean and spacious  Overall  nice atmosphere and  based on observation  experienced bar staff "
R0144,Food was excellent  staff very attentive  cannot fault anything 
R0144,"good food 

Friendly staff  nice surroundings"
R0144,I went here last Saturday for brunch with my friends  the place was very busy  you have to wait 15/20 minutes at least  The atmosphere is young and fresh  the local is kind of hipster  The best thing of this place is the coffee  best Cappuccino in Dublin  Cakes and juices are really good
R0144,"Myself and my husband took my parents there for Xmas lunch   I had requested a table not too far from the facilities as my parents are elderly   However we were placed right in the middle of the floor   To our right there was one business man on his laptop with a nice table to the side  His paperwork was spread across the table  He remained there for the whole time we had our meal   Behind us to the left there was a large table of at least 20 people including children having their xmas lunch   Presents were exchanged including scooters etc for the children  While trying to enjoy our meal  unfortunately for us  we found ourselves surrounded by the excited children trying out their new toys including the scooters   The situation became very uncomfortable for us and we had to move table 

I ordered fillet steak medium   I have no doubt that my steak was reheated   It was shriveled and dry   My fathers steak came out rare   He had ordered medium   My father was unable to eat his steak and we called the waiter   The fondant potato had a strong flavor of ""reheat""   Similar taste to next day reheated potato 

The desert was a huge disappointment   Definitely no pastry chef in the kitchen that day   The meringue lemon curd dessert I ordered was not homemade and definitely bought in  That is to say the meringue was ""definitely from a box""  My mother did not eat her trifle   She said there was no fruit in it   It was a glass of liquid 
Overall our dinner was a huge disappointment and I would highly not recommend this restaurant for a special occasion 

Not one member of staff approached us at the end of the meal to ask us how it went   This was symptomatic of the lunch "
R0144,"Sangria sucked  bruscetta was dank  pizza 5/10  lasagna 6/10  We got our leftovers ""boxed up"" for take out for our late evening drunchies  which was a complete disaster  These guys actually put pizza and lasagna in aluminum foil and wrapped it up in a ball  Come on now get it together "
R0144,The  2  menu was very limited  The food was average although inexpensive  In my view you dont go to here for a value meal  There was no dinner menu online I had steak which was of diner quality  There was virtually no starter choices that you could really consider we both ended up having soup  I asked twice in advance for a nice table  We ended up in the middle of floor and I was constantly being banged by passing waiters and other guests  In fairness  on the night there seemed to be lots of groups hence not many tables for two  The floor layout could have been better   it was lazily set up  The dinning room is beautiful  it would not take much to improve the experience   provide a menu that is fitting 
R0144,The hotel as a whole has changed greatly but nowhere more than the restaurant  From the burnt charcoal taste of a steak to the fact that the staff started to clear all the empty tables around us while we ate  this was a really poor dining experience 
R0144,"The server completely forgot our order   after 40 minutes we realised that it would never come until we asked them about it  after 5 minutes we were served  total minutes waiting = 45 minutes and it was obvious that the food was reheated  I wonder if we didnt ask for it if we would be served 
I guess not 
Not coming back "
R0144,The service was very poor while the food was not hot  Overall a less than impressive evening 
R0144,This dining spot had got to be one of my favorites  The steaks are amazeing  The chefs here really know what they are doing  Great atmosphere 
R0144,This was a less than good experience despite it being  Five Star Hotel  My chicken was dry as was the potato served with it  My colleagues Navarin of Lamb looked like a badly presented overlooked stew 
R0144,"This was a very disappointing experience  Having eaten in the main dining room before I was shocked to be shown the previous tea are/residents lounge 
There were no table cloths 
The food was inedible   was the steak pre cooked I think so 
The service was good as clearly the waiter was embarrassed to serve such dross 
I will never return  This hotel is masquerading until a 5 star label which its dining room clearly is not "
R0144,"Very Disappointing 

My first visit to this restaurant was with my mum for Mothers Day  Thankfully  my recent visit was not for anything special as it was so disappointing  The hotel have moved the dining room into a much smaller  darker area with just 10 tables making it like a bistro / bar food affair with a cheaper paper menu to match  wine list on the reverse     The food was only ok   again not really what you would expect  The old dining room was much nicer  airy  bright  We would both be reluctant to return unless the dining room comes back  "
R0144,"Very hungry so wanted something nearby and quick so tried out this place  a buffet style eatery at this basement located food court in the city center 

The price was right  the quantity of possible food was right but where was the spice 

Quickly learning that here in Ireland a ""2"" on the spicy meter means its spicy when I need it to be an ""8""  ""9"" or a ""10"" for my own tastes     which is unfortunate 

Wont be going back here but this place gets the 2nd star cause it wasnt horrible  just disappointing "
R0144,"we came here after being a bit tired of Irish food    didnt get a traditional Irish dish  just got seafood chowder but it was super good  Wouldnt recommend the vegetable soup  
"
R0144,We went there for supper last night  This place has a relaxed atmosphere and is in an interesting location  The waitrons were friendly and attentive  I ordered the beef chimichangas and The Wife had the tacos  Both were very tasty  I also ordered a mojito  
R0144,We were staying in the hotel  but couldnt be seated until 9 15  as it was a rugby weekend  We were down on time but the table wasnt ready so we were taken to the bar  where we sat for 5 mins and waited unsuccessfully for someone to take an order for a drink  The menu for dinner looked good  but the scallops starter was over cooked  as was the fish in the main course  The venison however was lovely  but portions were SO small and not a potato in sight  unless it was ordered as a side  Sweets were good too  However  the wine was too expensive for what it was  and overall the meal was overpriced for what we got  The waiter was very pleasant and helpful  but we went away feeling that we had had better meals in other hotels for a lot less 
R0144,We were unlucky  as the night we dined there the dining room was practically empty  There was a big rugby match next door in the RDS which probably reflected the lack of people dining in the hotel  The food was typical good quality hotel fare  nothing to get too excited about  The staff were very attentive  The only real irritation arrived when it was time to pay the bill  We had a 150 euro voucher  our meal cost 144 euro and I was going to bump it up to 160 euro to reflect the tip  A very embarrassed waiter returned to say our voucher covered the meal but we would not got the 6 euro change as the person who issued it originally now didnt work there  I was flabbergasted and glad we had used up most of the voucher so we only lost 6 euro  I didnt want to make a fuss but I shall never dine there again thats for sure
R0145,Friendly and chatty owner  solid breakfast  Got the history of black pudding too  Ireland rocks 
R0145,A fine little restaurant with perfectly presented dishes 
R0145,After previous visit suggested we met friends in this restaurant  We had really enjoyed our previous meal  On this occasion food was not as good  Salads looked a bit jaded  Portions small and overall a disappointment  Perhaps the chef had a night off but after recommending it to our friends we were disappointed 
R0145,As always the most homely  authentic and hospitable place to dine out  Food is excellent 
R0145,Best falafel in Dublin  Cosy  authentic atmosphere and great staff    
R0145,Creative and flavoursome food with a great wine choice  Try the njuda mussels or the rabbit  Cosy and youre close to your neighbours but fantastic 
R0145,Desert was ginger panna cotta  with melon granita  which was light yet intense in flavour and delicious 
R0145,Excellent experience great value
R0145,Excellent food and excellent service from an authentic Italian restaurant  Prices were not outrageous either 
R0145,Fabulous  Best Middle Eastern food Ive had outside Lebanon
R0145,"Food was exquisite  the atmosphere was brilliant  the service delightful 
We will definitively return "
R0145,Go again  Great Quality  Friendly and Quick Service  Prices reasonable and I would go again next time I visit Dublin 
R0145,Great customer service  nice little restaurant  Felt welcome
R0145,Great Italian spot  Service was ok but the bruschetta and tagliatelle alla ragu was perfect  Would definitely go back 
R0145,Great service and pizza was delicious  �It was a quaint little place  that was very cozy 
R0145,I have visited this restaurant so many times   the food never disappoints   the staff are always attentive  and  friendly    Come here for a great dining experience   
R0145,"Im going here every week for my week breakfast treat
The muffins are really good and have one of the best cafe services in Dublin "
R0145,Love it here  Really tasty authentic Vietnamese food at very reasonable prices  Cant wait for sunny evenings on the deck 
R0145,Lovely evening with fantastic food at the right price
R0145,Lovely night at this restaurant  Food was delicious and service faultless  BYOB is always an added bonus  Very cosy and lovely atmosphere  Would recommend 
R0145,Super local favourite with tasty healthy Palestinian food served by lovely staff   very reasonably priced and byob with low corkage 
R0145,"Surprisingly mediocre 

Ive only ordered online from here before and this was my first time in the restaurant and I was quite surprised that it didnt live up to the hype  The service is great and they have a lot of good beer  The restaurant is a bit too dark which could be rectified  

Coming to the food  the starters are deadly    especially the Chicken Satay  The disappointment began for me with the main course  I had the Phad Thai and my friend had the Singapore Noodles and they were not as good as we remember having them home delivered  They were just   meh  

Maybe its a different chef  Maybe they were just having a busy week with the Web Summit and the surge in people showing up  Im not exactly sure why but I probably wont be going back "
R0145,"This place is tricky  because if you dont like what you get  its your own fault  because youre the one who chose it  However  in all fairness  the selection is pretty good and very interesting 

I mixed noodles  onions  peppers  tofu  mushrooms  fried onion and tandoori chicken and pork  and topped it off with teriyaki  tikka masala  lemon  sweet chili and sciracha sauces  Do you think thats weird  Well  it was delicious  Plus  the lunch bowl was pretty satisfying 

Add that to a cool ambiance and a super nice staff  and youve got yourself a pretty good restaurant  Very good value for quality/quantity "
R0145,"This restaurant used to be exceptional
Unfortunately the quality of the food has deteriorated while prices have gone up considerably  Set menues are overpriced  All plates now dominated by a hug pile of rice and rather little of the actual dish  Presentation of food is poor  Would not go again"
R0145,"Tried here last week       porchetta special was absolutely tiny  I know the place  but the sandwich was 99 percent bread  barely any filling at all  Very disappointing 

Compared to other places nearby  this place doesnt stand a chance "
R0145,Very good food  friendly staff  The chicken tikka masala was to die for 
R0145,Very lovely ambient and nice staff  Great place for a shake or a great burrito or a salad even  Near parks  great for break from walking   
R0145,We had a very good time   The menu was small with plenty of fresh ingredients   From appetizers to desserts we enjoyed everything we had 
R0145,We went to the restaurant chose the home menu  Absolutely delicious   Gonna go for a second time for sure  
R0145,Wonderful Palestinian and Middle Eastern food  maybe the best in Dublin  Always love to come here  Great menu and friendly staff 
R0146,A superb venue for a business meeting over excellent food  staff couldnt do enough  perfect ambiance   Highly recommend 
R0146,The food is to a reasonable standard there is very little chefs work required or involved  The decor is faded  the staff appear remote and the very high unit prices  food and drink  do not offer value for money  There are far better other restaurants available  select one of them 
R0146,Beautiful food and brilliant staff   Thank you for making this birthday meal so special 
R0146,Birthday dinner nicely celebrated 
R0146,Disappointing   steaks did not live up to the billing 
R0146,Exceptional service from a warm friendly  reception  luxury comfortable surroundings  selection of gourmet fine dining  and  cosy bar setting for pre/post dinner drinks  I would highly recommend to friends for memorable occasions 
R0146,Fabulous is the only way to describe it
R0146,Great food  A real treat  Without doubt the finest restaurant in Dublin 
R0146,Lovely place to attend for our anniversary  Would recommend to everyone visiting from London  It isnt for someone on a budget but perfect for a special occasion
R0146,Lovely restaurant  fantastic ambience and beautiful food  Great service too  would highly recommend 
R0146,"Never Again 
Although they offer properly prepared food in  an elegant setting  we will never go there again   The blunt announcement on entry that the table must be given back in 2 hours was off putting even though the desire was reasonable  However  the servers rude suggestion after 2 hours and 3 minutes that it was our fault  rather than his delay  that people were waiting for the table was inexcusable  Florinos communication difficulties only accentuated his innate boorishness  He offered no insight into the menu  and his help with the ridiculously overpriced wine list was limited to verbatim reading of the list aloud  Management seems deluded into thinking it can coast on past reputation and location  but Dublin offers many better choices in every respect "
R0146,Outstanding  Excellent quality steaks  Love the wine list  Great downstairs bar  Fun US Presidential theme 
R0146,Poor experience on this occasion  The food was of a good standard  We both had steak and the creamed mash  and satueed mushrooms  The price of the food is very expensive  200 euro for 2 mains  bottle of wine and 2 shared sides 
R0146,Simply the best restaurant in Dublin
R0146,Soooooooooooo nice  From the moment we arrived until we left we had an amazing time  Upon arrival we were greeted with a great welcome by two lovely friendly girls on the front desk  We were shown to our table and our lovely waiters greeted us and were extremely nice  Our food was beyond amazing and the staff surprised us by presenting us with chocolates and a glass of fizz for our anniversary  Im looking forward to visiting again soon and highly recommend to everyone looking for an amazing night out 
R0146,The ambience  food and service was elegant  A wonderful experience on our first visit to Dublin 
R0146,This is a great steakhouse   My filet mignon was prepared perfectly and served by the chef  My wife loved the lamb chops  The service by the entire staff was excellent 
R0146,Unreal steak and fantastic service  A wonderful treat
R0146,Whenever we are in Dublin Ireland  which is twice a year  we always make sure we stop into the restaurant once or twice   We love the bar for cocktails and the relaxed atmosphere of the restaurant   Always happy with our choices   Would highly recommend  
R0147,"Here once before  seafood chowder was at that time great  Seems all the pubs/restaurants in this area now get their prepared chowder from the same purveyors its lousy  salty  minimum seafood  
Another favorite is Irelands famous soda bread  found here before however not this time just a couple  pieces of plain brown bread  didnt eat it  
The Irish lamb stew was excellent  
Overall a disappointment as this pub was recommended by a �local gentleman so will most likely explore another pub on next trip through Dublin "
R0147,I have had a simple request ignored TWICE  coke instead of diet coke  by the takeaway and another request ignored once  No onions   And this is after putting the requests in the comments section  Im sorry but this is unacceptable  I wont order from here again and Im a regular customer 
R0147,We had the Irish breakfast  which was very overwhelming  The ingredients seemed a bit low in quality  but I wouldnt have expected anything more  cause it was soo cheap 
R0148," Nicest steak Ive had in a long time  Absolutely delicious  Cooked medium to perfection and nicely sliced for mouthwatering bite size pieces 

The pork belly starter and the peanut caramel biscuit dessert was also amazing  Perfect sized portions "
R0148,A girl behind the counter who wasnt even making our burrito asked my boyfriend for his name to write on his burrito but didnt ask mine funnily enough  She made a whole charade about his name  refused me the student discount and then when my boyfriend had collected the change and burritos  A couple of minutes later  we realised the receipt was in actual fact the girls number and something written in Spanish on it  I was so angry and threw the burrito in the bin  Horrible  disrespectful staff  Ive no interest in giving such people money 
R0148,"Always a good evening never disappoints me 
Thank you"
R0148,Amazing chicken and waffles for brunch 
R0148,Beautiful meal  really unusual and gorgeous menu  Service was excellent  
R0148,Beautiful restaurant great stuff great food   staff were every welcoming creating a lovely warm atmosphere   thoroughly recommend 
R0148,By far 1 of the worst chips do be freezing and the burgers are muck  Skip this place
R0148,"Came here for brunch  We arrived before 12 on a Saturday  It was pretty empty and we managed to get a window table  The window tables are great for people watching  

The staff that served us were fine  They were polite but not as warm as they could be  The music was OK  It was easy to hear because the place seemed to lack a buzz  
To the food  I was torn between the pineapple and cream cheese French toast and the gammon steaks with chipotle pineapple relish  I chose the gammon steak and a glass of prosecco  A decent pour but the prosecco was flat  The food was OK but just OK  The gammon just needed ""something"" as it was kind of bland  
I couldnt give this a three when there are far better places  I dont think Id make a return visit "
R0148,Couldnt fault the food although the menu did need some explaining  Service was overly attentive but very friendly  Wine choice was good 
R0148,Delicious food  lovely location and excellent service  Would highly recommend
R0148,Some of the dishes dont work well  Prices are high enough for everything to be perfect but the overall experience was far from the required standard 
R0148,Did not live up to the standard of other similar venues  Menu is awkward and we did not get good advice from waiter tried to sell us too much food  Some of the dishes dont work well  Prices are high enough for everything to be perfect but the overall experience was far from the required standard 
R0148,Excellent meal   wonderful service   Highly recommended  A girls night out   Made to feel very comfortable   Loved the enthusiasm of the staff   My second time there   Perfect experience
R0148,Food was fabulous  Great flavours  The service needs attention  Little too much upselling from some  Little inexperience on service delivery as well 
R0148,Food was not good and took a long time to be served
R0148,"Food was very nice  
Matradee was rude and this soured the evening "
R0148,"Found the receptionist rude and aggressive  
Other staff were fine but atmosphere seemed intense "
R0148,Friday at 9 30 we thought was a good time to test this new venture   a welcome greeting and a corner seat and it was warm and as we had just come from the Leinster match much appreciated   another place was set for our party of four  coats taken and menus delivered to the table  The first wine I picked was not available and then my first starter wasnt available   just keep going and get the food  So we waited and waited  drank our drinks   a complimentary dish was sent out  not that old trick   had they forgotten about us  Eventually and just before a reminder to the management at 10 45 out food arrived and was delicious I have to say   everybody was happy   apart from my wife getting continually bashed every time somebody got up  or food was delivered to the table next to us  the waiter refilling my red wine glass with white wine  with some of my red wine still left for me to savour   no worries he brought back a fresh glass with a splash of red wine in it and then for some reason found it very difficult to clear the table   fortunately his colleague was at hand and he knew what he was doing  Teething problems  maybe and we all agreed we wouldnt rush back for a  Euro 270 bill 
R0148,"Great coffee   full range of milk  soya   coconut  almond etc  
Staff very friendly  and  loyalty scheme for coffees  and  crepes"
R0148,Great dining room and atmosphere  Style over substance both with the food and the service  overall the meal fell short and certainly didnt justify the price 
R0148,Great food  presentation  service and atmosphere  Will be back
R0148,Great little pub  
R0148,Great post match venue for food
R0148,"Had heard a lot about this place so was looking forward to going here for brunch 
The place was busy which was a good sign but unfortunately they dont seem to be able to handle a busy service as it took them over half an hour to bring our food 
The brunch menu is unimaginative  its pretty much just eggs and then for some reason  lasagne is stuck at the bottom  I went for the creamed spinach and asparagus with poached egg  singular    which was disappointing due to the lack of food and the slightly higher price of it compared to other things on the menu  The flavours were only ok  
The service  as I said  was slow and they didnt ask me whether I enjoyed my meal at the end  I asked for the bill and when I paid the waiter assumed that my change was his tip  Instead of bringing me my receipt and change  he kept it and continued to serve other customers  I got his attention and asked for my change  which he took nearly 10 minutes to bring to me  
I wont be coming back  Theres so many better options In the area that Im baffled how it does so well  

Dont believe the hype  this place is over  "
R0148,"Had heard negative reviews  especially around the menu  Respect this is an attempt at innovation but it seems to have been done without consulting any actual customers  We rolled with our gut  not the advice of the staff and ended out with still too much food  I cant imagine how ripped I would feel had I followed their advice and ended up not finish half of my food  

I recommend closing for a week or two  perfect the menu with user tests and relaunch  Or offer a discount for �menu under construction  Continuing as is will lead to general rejection "
R0148,"How to get everything right  This team is at the top 
Anne"
R0148,"Hugely over priced versus the competition 
A confused menu that tries to be unique and edgy but fails to deliver anything more than some flat breads and some standard dishes  Starters that are too big  mains that  if ordered alone  would be too small    resulting in over  Euro 100/head and leaving the place feeling like a balloon  The prices on the chalk board list of steaks is enough to tell you the place is trying to rob every penny from the punters pocket  Loads of clueless staff pacing around the place that are hard not to feel sorry for "
R0148,I dined here with a friend on the 19/7/2019  We received a very friendly welcome and were seated immediately  The service was excellent and extremely efficient  The food was beautifully presented and was excellent in taste and flavour   The desert was beautiful  If you fancy a nice dining experience Id highly recommend this establishment 
R0148,I pre booked in advance to avoid any qs and when I arrived to the restaurant our booking was not on the book  The blond girl who was on front of house was absolutely rude and over dramatic  She start accusing me of raising my voice  when this wasnt the case   Another man stepped in and took over and he was very polite and helpful  She then proceeded to go behind the bar and talk to another colleague who I assumed was a manger because she wore a blazer and started talking about us  Which I also felt was unprofessional  She was waving her hands and pointing at us and clearly talking about us  During our meal the blonde girl repeatedly walked by our table and gave us dirty looks which made me and my family feel very uncomfortable  The food wasnt bad I cant fault it  But personally I wouldnt recommend that girl to work in hospitality or the food industry  I would recommend her to go on a course to better her greeting skills as I wouldnt want anyone to get the same treatment  This really put a damper on our experience and I would strongly consider weather I would visit again 
R0148,I was disappointed to be brought to my table instead of the loft bar for my cocktail   We were only served our cocktail when we were asked for our food order  Hence the starter came before we could linger over the cocktail so I felt very rushed 
R0148,I was disappointed with my meal  I ordered Cod without mushrooms as Im allergic to them   This was no problem according to the waiter   The same waiter disappeared to work behind the bar when my main course arrived   and yes  the Cod was on a bed of mushrooms   There was no one to assist us  all staff were rushing  too busy to see our calls for help   To avoid my partners dinner getting cold I pushed the cod to the side of my bowl  plate  to try and eat the fish away from the mushrooms  I wanted him to enjoy his meal as my meal was already ruined   Finally someone did come to our table and I requested a hot plate to eat the remainder of the Cod   The original waiter did apologise for his error and said he would look after us   When we got out bill I was shocked that we were charged in full for my Cod   The bill was adjusted to ensure we were not charged for glasses of wine  but this gesture did not make up for our night being ruined   Sorry but I would not be recommending anyone to eat here 
R0148,"I was here the other night with my boyfriend and eveyhing about the place was just terrible  I thought the decor was outdated  the tables all seemed very far apart and there was just too much space in the place for it to feel in any way homely  

We were left sitting for about 15 minutes before anyone came to ask if we wanted to see menus or get a drink     they didnt serve Guinness but had something else that was half the strength and according to my partner it wasnt great  

After a further 15minutes we got our starter  We both ordered soup that was served with crusty white rolls which was nice  but far from hot  

The staff clearly forgot about us as we were left sitting with empty bowls in front of us for nearly an hour before someone realised we were finished  

The girl then brought us our main courses  I ordered the Guinness pie which was probably the worst thing Ive eaten in a long time  truth be told I hardly touched it  It was freezing for starters  The stew came in a side bowl  and I stay stew instead of pie because it looked like stew with a rock hard Yorkshire pudding �floating around on top  It also came with mash just plonked on the side of the plate     which had formed a skin on it   it was that cold  The stew also had a serious amount of Guinness in it and it was far too strong I simply couldnt eat it  

My boyfriend got the buttermilk chicken with a side of chips  the buttermilk chicken was alright  but the chips were shrivelled and tasted reheated too and the mayo that came with the dish tasted off  

I wont be back here again in a hurry "
R0148,It was a very mixed experience  Some dishes were great  beef tartar  chips    some were really quite poor  crab that was 90 per cent rice   It could be great but they need more consistency in the menu  Service was dire  The lay out is odd too  I felt like i was in a corridor  Not the best but I will give it another shot 
R0148,It was fantastic
R0148,Mixed advice from waiters on how much to order  Pork Belly was very poor
R0148,Nice and fast service until late night  The food will not blow your mind but it will feed you 
R0148,A customer should never feel like they are defending themselves regarding what they did and did not order  Manager did finally come to our table at end of meal to offer his apologies but a little too late 
R0148,One of the best reataurants in Dublin at the moment 
R0148,Perhaps it was the bank holiday  however  the restaurant was practically empty   Service was great  really nice people   Food was unimpressive  burgers were nice  however  hard to get that wrong  but feeling was that it was overpriced for what it was and not very memorable 
R0148,Quite overpriced for what it is  38 euro for a sirloin steak with no sides  Probably most suited to corporate customers 
R0148,"Really good food  
Some of the worse service I have experienced in Dublin  Left for prolonged times alone so much so that we had to heckle to get waiting staff to serve us  The service was slow  casual and so poor that it actually overshadowed that whole dining experience  If the dire service situation in this place was sorted this place could have a lot of potential "
R0148,Really welcoming  great value  lovely coffee  Highly recommended  if you are lucky to get a table   
R0148,Service was poor  Going to a concert and 40 min wait between starter and mains  Despite being told that they needed the table back at 7 30  mains only arrived after 7 00  I felt like the service team were trying to upsell the food at the start   Not a great experience considering the expense which is at the top end of the market 
R0148,The service was impeccable and the food was absolutely delicious 
R0148,The service was so bad  We ordered our drinks when we were seated and Our food arrived before our drinks arrived       25 minutes later  No flexibility on menu  Asked for the broccoli with no cheese  Not possible  So many stressed managers running around made staff v nervous  Wont be back 
R0148,This is a welcome addition to casual but elegant dining in Dublin  Fabulous food and excellent service 
R0148,This review is based on their brunch menu  I was rather unimpressed  The venue itself is urban rugged  You know  wood everywhere with funky pictures and the tin cups to give it that urban edge inside what feels like a log cabin  
R0148,Trying too hard with the food  For such high prices  nothing tastes in the superlative  Every dish was meh  Even the burger wasnt great
R0148,Tuna starter amazing  But disappointed with the steak quality  which was way overpriced 
R0148,Very disappointed this is my first time to ever write such a bad review when we arrived 7 mins late we were greeted at the door by manager explaining he was just about to call us as the kitchen was closing this automatically set the scene of been unwelcome/rushed  Not only was it very unclear online booking that this was the last table it never mentioned the bar would also be closed so drinks would be limited     the food was nice but not up to the usual standard but overall experience was awful to add insult to injury our bill came to 135 for 40 mins in the seats total as we felt so uncomfortable between for of us we paid 155 the person serving said thank you and closed the till which is so rude we didnt intend on giving a tip which I have never done before  for such poor service my partner actually asked for our change back which was mortifying but completely necessary given our experience    we would not be returning or recommending in future very dissapointing 
R0148,Very disappointing meal on Tuesday night  we shared the duck main course and it was really poor  undercooked  chewy  cold    I thought it reflected very poorly that when they cleared table and saw most of the food left behind there was no follow up asking if anything was wrong   All told  not impressed 
R0148,"Very disappointing  Extremely expensive burger that the onion rings were cold  Marginal burger at best  Staff was slow but friendly 

Would not recommend over some of the dedicated burger places "
R0148,"Very poor  Over priced pompous food  Have a good feed at home before you go as you will be hungry on the way out
Went with husband for a birthday meal  Being vegan I rang ahead  and  let them know I was vegan 
Normally when you do this at high class eaterys they hand you the vegan menu when you sit down at your table  Not here  Gave both of us the standard menu not even the early bird menu  we had arrived early enough for the early bird menu if either of us wanted to   They are out to make as much money off you as possible folks  they even rang me the day before to see if I needed to book a table at the cocktail bar as we were only allowed to sit at our table for 2hrs at the weekend for dinner If we were not finished in that time we would have to move upstairs to finish in the cocktail bar  Apparently you need to book a table in the cocktail bar at the weekend  to ensure there is a table there for you at the  weekend after 8pm  So after getting the wrong menu  me  my husband got the right one I guess as he ended up not getting anything from the early bird menu either  the maitre D asked us if we would like sparking water    again not offering tap water  Free   We asked for tap water   We both had some kind of avocado cucumber  and  spicy almond nut starter   pseudo Japanese inspired perhaps   it was ok but not in any way impressive  I had the shiitake mushroom stew from the vegan/ vegetarian menu  Again it was well flavored if slightly salty but if you were hungry this would not go any way in curing your hunger Im afraid  To small a portion and whats exciting about mushroom stew on its own    nothing at all  My husbands fish was ok again an asian slant to his dish but again only the fish n a bit of pak Choi    you would not want to be hungry or youd be left wanting There was no choice for a vegan dessert sadly as usual in Irish mainstream restaurants  hubby had sticky toffee pudding it was good but v  sweet"
R0148,"Restaurant was very full  Had booked onlinebut was told could only have table for an hour  laughed at Maitre D  
 Food was average  surroundings very nice  if not a little cramped with too many tables tucked in to a small space 
Would not recommend

"
R0148,We had lunch on Saturday  booking for 1 45pm   we arrived at 1 30pm received bill at 3 40pm   had we not asked for each course to be cleared  I feel we would have missed the match  service was extremely slow for lunch service   we had to ask for each course to be cleared   it was like nobody was looking after our table or assigned to us   just had to ask anybody passing by  The food when it did arrive was excellent  Im sure we dont need to tell you by now people are struggling with your shared food style   it causes issue for 3 diners together   The table we were sat on right next to the door is not suitable   it was very cold day and it was very chilly every time the door opened   even more so why the team struggled with the constantly ringing fire panel  Staff very helpful and friendly when they did serve us  Just really disappointed by the whole experience  Team excellent  and  food excellent � I hope you accept the feedback and get the whole thing to gel better  Thank you
R0148,We left disappointed    perhaps its teething issues but the menu was overly complex and the food wasnt upto scratch
R0148,What a team everything  wonderful  It is seldom such a complete experience 
R0148,"While the restaurant was nicely appointed  and the food was beautiful and delicious; the service absolutely stunk  I had ordered a water with lemon based on being tired from a day of sight seeing and was already tired  The small glass was emptied pretty quick  The server looked at the glass several times and didnt bring a refill  My fiance had asked for another glass of wine at one point and we didnt get that until after the dessert was brought  We took the glass of wine back to our room  
I understand we werent exactly dressed for an upscale dinner  But it was attached to our hotel and we were the only customers in the place for most of the dinner  When we left there were three other tables  So being busy wasnt an excuse  This was our worst dining experience we had in all of Ireland "
R0148,The restaurant was too cold  Despite asking to turn down the AC the wait staff ignored us
R0148,Worst customer service ever  I dont expect much but at least be friendly  And theres no reason to be snappy at me if you decide to work here
R0149,Great burger  Recommend the sweet potato chips  Staff was friendly and fast  Would come again 
R0149,Amazing Serivce and delicious food  We had such a good night here and well definitely be going back 
R0149,Average food  I ordered Chicken Katsu Curry which absolutely needs some improvement there   Good staff 
R0149,Daily bento box was great value and very good   We had the A GE sushi roll which was awesome
R0149,Despite booking for 5 people we were given a table for 4 and then had to source our own 5th chair squashed in where all our food didnt fit  I was in the middle of the floor where other customers kept hitting into me on their way out with one drunk customer reaching over my back and touching my food before laughing and leaving  The door was ajar and we all were freezing and the staff were so rude throughout  The food was nice though 
R0149,"Dont these gluttons just make you sick 
Maybe the gluttons should stick to fish n chips after the pub"
R0149,"Dumplings were in under cooked  teriyaki lacked teriyaki  Steak was fatty 
Server was pleasant  but was rudely treated by manager onsite which was uncomfortable for all "
R0149,Excellent burgers  amazing onion rings  great goat cheese salad  �Good casual ambiance  � Great food and service 
R0149,Excellent food  great value  top class service
R0149,"Food wasnt great  and service was even worse  We ordered a starter and a main each  my starter and main came out at the same time while my friends starter came out ten minutes later  

Lovely interior  staff were very friendly but unfortunately would not recommend "
R0149,Food wasnt great 
R0149,Great start and everyone enjoyed in the main although my Katsu Curry was disappointing
R0149,"Having waited and waited  speculating anxiously outside the Duck doors  I am both sad and sorry to say that I have been monumentally disappointed  

What can only be described as a jazzed up but very average Chinese takeaway  Duck did little for me  proving to be style over substance in the truest sense"
R0149,Its a fair venue in downtown Dublin  with decent food  no pickled egg in my ramen  although it was on the food description and it is expected in a bowl like that   The waiting service was obviously non experienced  although very friendly   the menu was short as a lot of the options were not available on the day  especially from the drinks menu   This place is an ok choice  however  given the options of places in the vicinity  this one would not be on the top of my list 
R0149,Noise level so loud we could barely hear each other  Would not return 
R0149,Really enjoyable meal food and service was excellent
R0149,Service was awful  They forgot to put in half our order and had to ask us again twice what we had ordered in the first place as they never put it in  Received Gyozas and shockingly over cooked edamame beans  yes thats possible  15 minutes after we finished the rest of our meal  Not even as much as an apology or 10 percent off when we asked for the bill  Really disappointing 
R0149,The best Sushi Ive ever had in Dublin  The menu is amazing and the quality of the sushi is outstanding 
R0149,The food was excellent  especially the seven spice calamari   Highly recommended 
R0149,The food was extremely delicious and flavorful  However  the service was extremely rude  We were forced to leave after 2 hours  while we were still enjoying drinks  When I booked the table  they did not mention a 2 hour time limit  This is something that the customer should be informed of when booking the reservation  and not during our dinner  that too while entertaining our guests   This is extremely inconsiderate treatment of your paying customers  and I will think twice about ever coming back 
R0149,This place is now my favorite restaurant for Japanese food  Seriously good bento box 
R0149,Way too greasy pizza
R0149,We ordered the rainbow roll  the chicken gyoza  edamame  kimchi and chicken skewers  The food was not great  The sushi didnt seem very well made or really fresh  The edamame portion was quite small also and the kimchi lacked real flavour  The chicken skewers were barely cooked and therefore tasted unusual and jelly like  We ordered a glass of prosecco too and weirdly only got half a glass   The staff were nice although inexperienced  Toilet facilities were awful  Disappointing because Id heard good things about the restaurant  Perhaps I was there on an off night but I wont be going back to find out 
R0150,5pm seating  staff relaxed  friendly and welcoming  Good menu on offer 
R0150,A bit expensive but worth
R0150,A disappointing experience  Specifically asked for our food not to be brought for a few minutes while we were having our cocktails  Waiters response was �of course were not McDonalds � but unbelievably food arrived 5 mins later  Starter was very good but our main was bland  A tomato salad that was served far too cold with croutons that were so hard they couldnt be eaten without some dental damage   Its unlikely well be back
R0150,Average quality of food overly priced  Friendly personnel but will not go back
R0150,Based on the prices charged  we were looking forward to a real treat  We found the food was lack lustre and lacking imagination and the quality underwhelming  Service was good as was the location and how the restaurant looks 
R0150,Beautiful interiors and wine list however fish arrived with a side different to that listed on the menu which was disappointing and meant the dish wasnt great value for money  Service was excellent however and the fresh bread was delicious 
R0150,"Below average and would not recommend 

Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by two individuals  neither were welcoming and one of the individuals made you feel like we  the customer   was lucky to be dining at the restaurant 

The service staff are good and very helpful   The food was very average  they failed to deliver the side dishes we order and the quantity of food was small 

Overall I would not recommend this restaurant "
R0150,Best place in the city for seafood  Small and cosey inside  Super friendly staff  explain the menu in detail  I hadnt a clue what dressed oysters were or how to eat crab claws they were super helpful and great teachers  The lobster rolls and chowder are to die for   10/10 they are super popular and busy but worth the wait for sure  
R0150,Best seafood in Europe or perhaps the world  Ana the head chef was of course amazing and so was Lubo who served us  a very fine establishment 
R0150,Disappointing evening  Oysters were very dry and John Dory was over cooked  Management response was disappointing initially  although the GM tried hard to recover the situation  Faulty alarm on extraction system didnt help 
R0150,Excellent food  service  and atmosphere  Great staff  and classic 1950s/60s Jazz on sound system  10/10 
R0150,Expensive for what you get  food quality poor  staff were friendly
R0150,Fabulous pub in the oldest part of dublin great pint and super barman  Music every night from traditional ciellis and folk music sing alongs
R0150,Fair welcome  fair service  good food  we picked the pricy ones such us oysters and crab legs    A reasonable dining experience during our stay in Dublin in May 2019 
R0150,Fantastic fry for a fantastic price staff are lovely but the White pudding is the best
R0150,Fantastic night  The food was top notch and the service was excellent  We will be back 
R0150,"To make matters even worse  they call them ""savage"" rolls and will correct you if you ask for a sausage roll  They wont even say the term ""sausage rolls "" Absurdity  Id call them ""savagely bad"" rolls anyways 

Moving on to the lunch  the focaccio chicken sandwiches were quite disappointing  The chicken was gray colored  the roasted vegetables tasted funky  the sauce was bad  and the filling to sandwich ratio was off as well  1"" filling to 5"" bread   Even the side salad tasted bad 

The only redeeming grace of this place was that a woman working there kindly offered up her seat to myself and my girlfriend  But hey  this is a food review site and the high rating that this place currently has is undeserved "
R0150,Food was delicious   I had the poached eggs and mushroom toast dish and it was very satisfying   Will be back for sure 
R0150,Food was excellent  Venue was lovely  Staff were very attentive and observant  Prosecco was given to all patrons on Saturday evening to help you celebrate  Our waiter saw the prosecco at our table and brought me a non alcoholic cocktail instead  Im 8 months pregnant and had ordered one of your non alcoholic cocktails earlier in the evening  It was a was lovely gesture and not one Ill forget  Ive already told a few people about the experience  We will highly recommend the restaurant  Thank you  Nora Cashe
R0150,For a fish restaurant the menu is limited  For example  no scallops or mackerel  I had a prawn cocktail starter   Euro 13 50  which was disappointing  prawns had grit in them  sauce was practically non existent and they were on a bed of dull  passed their use by date rocket and mixed leaves  instead of the advertised �watercress  and  cos�  The fish  and  chips for my main was ok  Fish was sitting in a pea puree which made the batter soggy underneath and the chips were tasteless  supposedly �hand cut� but Id say bought in bulk and handcut somewhere else  Overall  a disappointing experience  with an overpriced and limited menu  aiming at the high end but without the produce   cooking  or presentation to back it up 
R0150,Fresh   Tasty  and one of my new favourite spots in Dublin 
R0150,Good food but  as others mentioned   the kitchen is extremely slow  In fact  another group made a point of mentioning that although the food was excellent  they really were surprised by the wait  We were on vacation so we didnt mind �that much but there really didnt seem to be much reason for it  It is a small place  so there werent that many people and not a lot of take out orders that I saw in the 1 5 hours that I was there  �There was a waitress as well as the cook  so it isnt as if one person was doing everything  Dont bother if you are in a rush 
R0150,Great little cafe but the service can be terrible at times  I have also found the food to be average at best depending on the day I visit the restaurant 
R0150,Great Irish coffee  Great food  Clean  convenient location and perfect pub atmosphere for lunch  Loved it 
R0150,Great menus  Had oysters and doversole  All made and cooked well  Staff very polite and service oriented 
R0150,Great pub   Quaint with a good selection of coders  Delicious food and comfortable booths to sit and listen to live music 
R0150,Great service and even better food 
R0150,Had a great time drinking here  The live bands  several nights in row  were all absolutely wonderful  Food was great too 
R0150,Had our annual friends christmas meal here last night  Some parts were good  Service and food were good I had the salmon and crab salad to start and the lamb shank for main  Both were fab and really good value   Everyone else had a mixture of steaks  chowder  mussels  irish coffees and yummy desserts 
R0150,Hi there I booked your restaurant for birthday dinner on Saturday 22 Sept we didnt catch one word that the waitress said  when she came to our table  service very business like and matter of fact not at all pleasant food was very nice but restaurant lacked ambience and didnt feel relaxed at all overall night very disappointing as we had been looking forward to the evening so much  
R0150,I give it 3 stars just for the price and quantity of food  Was very filling but definitely not great  Disappointing having all the noodle at the bottom and the massaman on the top very hard to mix it 
R0150,I had the smoked salmon on toast for breakfast  The salmon was so fresh and delicate   not stringing like some places   and it was paired with delicious creme fresh definitely would recommend
R0150,I like it and I will be back but please educate your waiters in better table manners  never ask customers to tell you the tip amount in front of everyone  It is at the discretion of every customer  No one is under any obligation to give a tip  I found this very rude 
R0150,I love it  the service is impeccable and the food is delicious  I would highly reccomend it for lunch and dinner 
R0150,I was not very sure of going to this place but after being there for dinner I have to say that it is more that recomendable  The food is brilliant  we tasted some burgers and wings and we really like it and for sure we will go there again 
R0150,Ive been going here for years and this place always has a great variety of healthy lunch time options with a chunk of bread and bonus piece of fruit
R0150,"Irish breakfast was just okay  One of
our group was not served for a good ten minutes after the rest of the group  Prices were reasonable"
R0150,"It is a sleek modern restaurant   Thats the best news   While the restaurant has promise  there are glaring issues 

During our very recent visit  the kitchen steam alarm jarringly and repeatedly went off at ever increasing intervals   The police were called   As we departed  with the alarm screaming from the outside  a man on the phone said  ""Im going to turn the system off""   Dinner in an expensive restaurant is not enjoyable under these circumstances 

Unfortunately  the food need work as well   For Dublin  this is an expensive restaurant   Thats okay as long as there is value in exchange   The Seafood Towers are very expensive but uneven in delivery   Crab were hot  small and very much overcooked   The dressing in the lettuce wrap overwhelmed the small prawns   On the positive side  the oysters and mussels  think these are winners on the mains sides  were wonderful   Our mains uneven as well   Gnocchi were okay  steamed salmon and John Dory were very good   

Service was attentive but not stellar   Forty minutes between starters and mains is a stretch 

Value and pricing dont quite add up   Heres hoping the owner and chef tighten up the ship for smoother sailing "
R0150,It was very hot  food was ok   Left and went for desert somewhere else
R0150,"It was very quiet  too quiet  although town was buzzing  We were seated to the rear which was even quieter and with less atmosphere  than the front  Our server rushed us when it was too soon to interrupt yet was not around at other times when we needed her  She dropped cutlery near our table first and later in the evening dropped crockery that broke behind us with a bang  Out came the brush and dust pain and someone from front of house apologising for the noise and disruption  We struggled to get our servers attention to get the bill although the restaurant was sparsely filled as described  The bill came with a perky reminder from our server about filling in the comment card  She seemed oblivious to the fact that the experience of the evening was impacted on in a negative way by her performance  
I had the starter ofLobster cakes  While the lobster was nice  the crumb was too thick and dense  My crab salad was lovely as was the passion fruit dessert  Prices are high  The wine list does not have a sufficient number of mid price range bottles on offer  For what we paid we were disappointed with the ambience  the service  the wine list and my starter  I was expecting better "
R0150,"Lovely dining experience  as always 
Everything was delicious from start to finish  and the service was great"
R0150,Lovely venue with great service but the food was disappointing
R0150,"My friends and I have come here for years because theres enough variety on the menu that everyone is sure to find something theyd like  I was surprised to find that on a Monday evening in January they were still out the door busy   but thankfully we were able to call ahead and put our name down to wait for a table 

The vegetarian selection is reasonable  There are even a few new additions to the menu  including the Taco Salad  which I ordered without chicken for a light meal 

 But theyre not trying to be a gourmet restaurant  Friends of mine rave about the chicken wings however   so I would say theyre worth giving a try if thats what you like 

Its not my first choice  but I know its consistent and reasonably priced so you can bet Ill find myself back on numerous occassions   they havent been around all this time if they werent doing something right "
R0150,My salmon was overdone along with vegetables  quite disappointing with the amount we paid for the meal 
R0150,My sister organised my 30th birthday here and the staff were exceptional  the service and great music really made the night   Thank you
R0150,Nice decor/bar  Good drinks  food very good  Great location  
R0150,"Not even average  Service was all over the place  Coffee was far too hot  The chocolate on my biscuit cake was melted away so it was just falling apart 

Dont think you get value for money here either 

Definitely wouldnt be my first choice for coffee here "
R0150,Oh my jaysis this place is just fantastic I have always loved it I love the way the interior is fashion ned from American pop culture of the world 50s and 60s  and right down to the dinky jukebox on every booth  And now we come to the food  Oh my god first of all the menus are laid out perfectly  if you are a fussy eater like me the menu is very detailed  I ordered the big hot dog  Guys when it came out I nearly died  so apart from being loaded with cheese �and bacon �it was quite a mouthful aherm but gorgeous and the fries �were lovely too  I cant recommend this place highly enough just do yourselves a favour and GO GO GO 
R0150,"One course 35 minutes after the rest 
My fish not good 
Waiter came liking for tip half way through dinner as he was good off duty 
No reduction of bill due to delay and poor course "
R0150,"Overpriced small portions
Cold seafood chowder   
Good better"
R0150,Ran up here for lunch to day   I made the mistake of ordering the number 4 sauce  despite being warned by the girl serving       And yeah     Very hot   Be warned
R0150,Really disappointing experience   Party of two and problems with 3 out of 4 dishes served   Two had to be sent back to have requested amendments fixed by the kitchen  and one dish was simply inedible and returned uneaten   Complimentary glasses of prosecco were offered and a bill adjustment  however a simple apology from management would have been much more palatable  The serving staff were left to try and appease the matter which really isnt fair  especially considering there were at least three management/front of house staff visible on the floor   However they seemed much more focused on the larger groups rather than on our party of two   Coats even had to be fetched by the bar staff  which couldnt help but make us feel that we were being purposefully avoided   Not the Saturday evening wed planned 
R0150,"Really the quality of the food was very poor  I had monkfish and red mullet  The monkfish was tough and overcooked  The red mullet was ok but it was ""dumped"" on a pile of couscous and the sauce has no taste  Its a pity as its a nice venue with friendly staff  But if you hold yourselves  out as a top fish venue customers expect exceptional fish cooked to perfection "
R0150,Really too expensive for the quality offered     not to mention the wine list for millionaires     very disappointed
R0150,Rude little French guy behind the counter making fun of us and being really bad at his job The guy really ruined the meal 
R0150,Seafood was mediocre  otherwise was good 
R0150,Setting and service amazing  Food however was very poor  Not sure if we were unlucky  Would not return  Highly disappointed however manager and staff very apologetic and we came to an agreement on the bill 
R0150,starter was bland and soggy  but the sea bass and halibut mains were good  Prompt service  Everything on the menu is substantially overpriced 
R0150,The big breakfast is pretty big  
R0150,"The service was probably the worst i have experienced   Waiting 1 5 hours for our food after we ordered 
Service was just awful"
R0150,"Third time there this year but nothing like as good as before  
The beef looks fabulous in reception but the sirloin was tough and poorly cooked  Little charting and lacked any depth if flavor  Calamari starter was ok but no better than any other restaurant in Dublin  Fig dessert lacked any sense of true flavor  The wine menu was lacking in imagination and over priced for what was in offer  particularly for red wines  
Service was not bad but again lacked any real hint of true engagement  
Disappointing and has moved from a recommend without hesitation venue to a think twice decision "
R0150,This place gets packed    No space  No fun 
R0150,This place is delicious / great service and great food   Ill definitely go back when Im next in Dublin 
R0150,This was a 5 star plaec when it first opened but I went back recently and was appalled at the level of the food  Just tasted like any other thai/chinese spot  I still love the ice cream though but that doesnt cover up the quality of the other stuff  Packed as usual but for how long   
R0150,Usually when I visit here the service is pretty quick  but unfortunately today this was not the case  
R0150,Very expensive and over priced   fish and chips was such a small portion   Staff and place were lovely 
R0150,"Very nice restaurant 

Food was amazing  great selection of drinks

Very friendly staff

Great service 

Would highly recommend"
R0150,Very overrated  the service was poor and everything took a long while even thought it was cold seafood that we had  the seafood tower for main was awful for  Euro 115 the top of it was stone cold out waiter didnt even come over to ask how our food was  Would never go back again very poor
R0150,Waitress was excellent  Food was good  Keep up the fine work we will visit next time for sure 
R0150,"We enjoyed a very good dinner in Dax 
The food was gorgeous and the wine perfect  Service is very very good too 
Well come back for sure  "
R0150,We love seafood  so gave this place a try   The seafood was delicious  but overpriced   We had the tuna tartar  scallops  John Dory  and salmon   The fig mille feuille was dry  nondescript  not satisfying    It was crowded  noisy  not very private  and we felt pressured by the hovering wait staff  
R0150,"We were barely seated when we were invited to order a drink  The drinks never arrived  We then ordered food and wine  The very expensive wine was served without as much as a word from the waiter/ sommelier  
The food came and went and then we ordered dessert: panna cotta   To best of my knowledge  this dessert should be set but ours was in a jar and runny like a yoghurt  We had to wait  20 minutes for coffee  We eat out in Dublins finest restaurants every weekend and this was an experience I wouldnt want to repeat 
 would not be an ambassador for dining in Dublin"
R0150,We were most disappointed by the 1/2 lobster thermador we each ordered  It was very dry  cold  no sauce and resembled a tiger prawn   The staff were kind enough to change our order  Im 46  and its the 1st time in my life Ive sent back a dish     For the money we paid for our night out  we were sadly disappointed   The restaurant itself was v cool   loved the interior but tables were tiny  Staff were extremely nice  friendly and kind  What was superb were the Rockerfella oysters and Norwegian crab legs  Although we went for the fish  the beef displayed looked out of this world 
R0150,Went for a kebak  nothing new here  Ketchup and mayo  lettuce  cabbage and a sliced burger  Chicken kebab  the same using pieces of fried chicken  Meh
R0150,Went for Fathers Day lunch  was very quite  Went for the set menu which for a fish restaurant was very limited  The special was trout which we both went for only to be told they had run out so we got hake instead  To say it was the smallest potion of fish Ive ever got in a restaurant is a fact  Very disappointing do not think we will return 
R0150,When we got there  it looked like it was a set menu for I think  Euro 34 for several courses  with no opportunity to order a la carte  Fortunately  my husband had been there before and asked if there was an a la carte menu because there had been last time  I ordered their namesake steak  which came already cut up  It was way too chewy and had a terrible texture  I suspect this is why they cut it up before serving  We each got one side each  The sweet potatoes were good  but the broccoli was almost raw  For both of our dinners  it was  Euro 29  If we had ordered off the original menu that the server gave us  we would have ended up with a bill of  Euro 68  The restaurant was incredibly loud as well  which could be improved with better acoustics 
R0150,While the restaurant was lovely and the servers all made a huge effort I was disappointed with the food especially considering the price 
R0150,With so many Mexican inspired eateries opened up in Dublin in recent years this restaurants tastes are stuck somewhere in late 90s Old El Paso concept of Mexican food   straight from the packet  My friends and I went here on a quiet Monday night  I hadnt been for years and thought the place had undergone a makeover but its seems the facade and menu design is all that has apparently changed  We were served a watery margarita  the tap water tasted strongly of chlorine and we were constantly swatting away fruit flies from our drinks  The supreme nachoes was a small bowl of chewy chips doused in bland guacamole  sour cream and what tasted like salsa straight from the jar  The chairs are fun and colourful but very uncomfortable  and space is at a premium  the servers kept sitting everyone on top of one another  in what was a quiet Monday service  Never  ever would I darken its door again  particularly if this is the quality of the food and the restaurant  so many fruit flies  they were gathering on the wall beside our table   that theyre going to keep serving up  There are much more palatable Mexican eateries only a few minutes away 
R0150,Wonderful staff  excellent food  beautiful space  Completely recommend
R0151," I visited here first time this weekend  on Sunday evening  I went with a group of six  

There seemed to be some very good dishes   my friends tried the chicken wings  chicken supreme  duck salad and a cod and chorizo special and all tucked in pretty happily  

Plenty of good things  great service  good value and the meat and fish dishes seemed to go down well  "
R0151," Euro 9 for wings and no fries with them   A bit steep I think  
I ordered the fries anyway at  Euro 4 extra  they were delicious  cooked in duck fat    but I felt a bit robbed to be honest 
I was also served the wrong cocktail and I was told that I was in fact mistaken   
Wouldnt rush back "
R0151,Absolutely terrible service  Didnt get served our coffee or juice for half an hour and when asked where one juice was they said they ran out of ingredients but failed to communicate that to the table  The avocado served was hard and coffees cold  For a restaurant with a lot of hype it definitely didnt deliver unfortunately
R0151,Already recommended to family to go here  Amazing food  good portion sizes and dessert was delicious
R0151,Bartender was extremely rude and unhelpful  All I did was ask for a beer and was given a huge dose of crap  
R0151,Booked lunch for 8 people at 2 30 upon arrival we are told kitchen closes at 3 00 and pizza was our only option  I am a coeliac so am unable to eat gluten  I had to move my group on a busy Sunday to somewhere that could accommodate us for lunch  I feel when the booking was confirmed by phone they should have been mentioned kitchen closing at 3pm  Extremely disappointing
R0151,Customer service very poor   waiter was very rude
R0151,Definitely not value for money  Decor poor compared to photographs  Food was ok but nothing special  Staff were not that friendly or welcoming  Overall disappointing
R0151,Dish ordered was bland and sloppy  herb potatoes with chorizo  black pudding and eggs in tomato sauce    no flavour from anything and very wet   I have eaten this dish in Spain on many occasions and the flavour should jump out and the potatoes should not be soggy   Very disappointing   Also  I was very surprised to learn that the chicken on offer is standard industrial reared chicken  not even free range   That meant chicken was off the menu for me anyway 
R0151,"Everything except the staff were meh   

Staff = efficient 

Food = Ugh  this is annoying  I really wanted to enjoy this but nothing was very good  in fact  it was kind of bad if Im honest  Steak was rubbish  like rubber  Sides were huge but bland and over cooked  

May try it again  but wouldnt recommend based on that visit "
R0151,Excellent brunch had by all  Each chose something different and all commented on quality and flavour  Highly recommend
R0151,Excellent evening  great food  service and atmosphere   Looking forward to the next visit 
R0151,"Extremely Disappointing  

Arrived at 5 : 30 pm   the restaurant looked to be at about 10 percent capacity   We asked could we sit at one of the 10 empty booths along the wall    We were told no as they are for parties of 3 more and they were all reserved anyway  When we left at 7pm eight of the ten booths were still empty   Another couple who arrived after us made the same request and got the same answer so 2 bookings have to sit in seats they dont like while looking at seats they would like remaining empty for the whole time they are there  Not the end of the world at least the dinner should be good no matter where your sitting  

We ordered starters and a main course of steak  The waitress was rude and argumentive when my partner asked for it to be cooked well done  She was told if she wanted it  well done it could be very tough and hard to eat 
I interjected and told her it was to be cooked well done   Her response to me in a somewhat abrupt manner was  "" well Im just letting you know it could be too tough ""  I think its surreal your asked how you like it cooked only for the waitress to absolve the restaurant in advance of the responsibility that it might be inedible  
 
The starter of crispy prawns were not crispy but soggy   My Fillet of beef ordered medium came medium rare which I could have gotten over but for the fact it wasnt hot   As it was  barely warm the rawness of the meat did not taste very nice  

2 starters   2 mains   4 drinks      E124

A dinner that wasnt nice served by someone who wasnt friendly or helpful and an evening wasted  

Informed the person in charge we were not happy and it was our first and last visit  

  The bread was nice and the Barman was friendly  "
R0151,Fabulous food  atmosphere  and  staff      planning the next visit already 
R0151,Food  was beyond  disgusting    Chips cold burger burnt   Absolute  disgrace
R0151,Food and Views were excellent   Waitress was very friendly and attentive  Good night
R0151,Food terrible  Found a hair in my food and just wasnt overall impressed
R0151,Food was poor and overpriced   Also noise level from bar distracting for diners   Should  not really be advertised as a restaurant   Will not be returning 
R0151,For me I would simply expect food to be better than I can make myself at home but having never cooked these dishes before I would be confident I could do better on a first attempt�
R0151,For us it was too loud and too many people standing around the tables drinking while youre trying to eat we had to try catch a waiter as they were all so busy and we had to keep asking for water as they were not allowed to leave the jug on the table ridiculous and there was no ice in the jug when it was 25 degrees outside  just wasnt a comfortable or relaxing dining experience and the music in the toilets was so loud I thought Id stepped into a club   wasnt for me but perhaps being 43 Im too old for this restaurant
R0151,"Got take away from here one night and it was vile  by far one of the worst take aways ive ever eaten out of in dublin 

I got fish and chips  �The fish was full of bones and did not taste good  �I couldnt finish it  �The chips werent much better  �Never again "
R0151,Great experience here food was amazing staff friendly and great service
R0151,Great food  great setting and service with a smile  Definitely a must visit when visiting Dublin  You will not be disappointed 
R0151,Great view but awful food  I went a year ago and the food was terrible  we thought wed give it another try because of the view  This time 3 of the 4 of us were very unwell from the meal  Ruined our weekend away to Dublin 
R0151,Had the Paleo lunch box here yesterday and was majorly disappointed I have to say   Cashew nuts were advertised but failed to make an appearance in the salad which was a soggy mess of luke warm black beans  wilted lettuce leaves  guac and a mustard dressing that was too thick and just had no place flavour wise with the rest of the ingredients  I had to pick the meat out from this concoction and the rest went in the bin   it was just awful  It pains me to write this as Ive had one of the tortas from here before and although I found it a little heavy and greasy it was miles better than what I was served yesterday  but after the fiasco of yesterdays lunch I cant say Ill ever be back 
R0151,Have been here on a number of occasions but on my last visit for Brunch on Saturday the service has really gone downhill   We had booked for 2 30pm for Brunch and all started well   We ordered a bottle of wine from a very limited White Wine menu but the waiter who took our order  was at the end of his shift so went home without passing on our order to anyone   Wine then arrived after the second order attempt   We then found out then that the wine menu we had been given was missing 2 pages       Food however was tasty   At the end of our meal we decided or should I say tried to order cocktails   After the 3rd attempt ordering from different waiting staff the cocktail order was again given to a waitress while we were in the middle of settling our bill  she  asked if she should add them to the bill already on our table trying to be nice I told her wed pay for them separately at the bar  and  settle the bill she had brought us   Again cocktails where forgotten   The waitress then tried to argue her point with me saying I took her up wrong   She said I told her not to take the order  and  I would order direct at the bar   not the case   Customer Service is seriously lacking here   What she should have done was agreed that this was a mis understanding on both our parts  and  asked for the cocktails to be made   But she was too busy letting me know she was in the right  and  the delay  4th time to order   was my fault   Put a sour note to the end of our Brunch when there was really no need   Would have complaint to the host on our way out but he wasnt at the desk when we were leaving   It was a shame as for 3 out of the 5 of us was visiting for the first time 
R0151,I am very reluctant to criticise waiting staff  They may have good reason for being disgruntled and I notice a high turnover of waiting staff    But  reluctantly  I have to give our waitress a big thumbs down for attitude and for forgetting us for half an hour  As we waited for our main course  On complaining  the manager gave us the option of free desserts/ coffee and the food and venue was  as ever  top class 
R0151,"I booked the table over 2 months before expecting to get a really good seat as it was a special occasion for a weekend away for my partners birthday  On arrival I was hit by the lifts door as I stepped into it the second it opened  I have now been left with a sore bruised arm  We were sat to our table and I was very disappointed that we were stuck on the end with the people sat behind us practically on our table   I had booked the restaurant well in advance to get the full effect of it by sitting in the booths or near the edge so we could see out over the city  
After being told that ""if you know the owner"" you get a better seat I was really not happy  that basically even though Id pre booked it well in advanced if someone else who ""knew the owner"" booked after us they would get preferncial treatment   
 We eventually got moved but I feel it was a little too late  The food was under seasoned and not pleasant to eat for the cost of it  
We were then left for about 10 minuets waiting for our change back from the waiter who proceeded to pour other customers next to us glasses of water  
 I wouldnt return here again Nor would I recommend any family or friends here   Very disappointed  "
R0151,"I dont know what happened last night but it was a shambles  First off we ordered our drinks  1 of our party had to re order the her drink 3 seperate Times and it still took 15 minutes to be brought down  Then some of the starters were cold  not fully cooked  They were veg so it was ok  After dinner we ordered a selection of desserts  cheese cakeand chocolate cake slices  These came out frozen solid  Who does this     Then when paying the bill they decided to try to charge for extra naan and extra beer which we didnt order  In �fairness they gave us free shots after all this BUT my shot glass had a lovely chip on the edge and I almost sliced my top lip with it  
While the mains were delish and we did get free shots it simply wasnt good enough to warrant further custom  We wont be back in a hurry "
R0151,I got chicken wings which had way too much tomatoey sauce on them  You couldnt actually taste the chicken  �My partner had bruscheta with chorizo and was a big portion  �The bread was soggy though 
R0151,I had heard so much about this place and probably put my expectations too high and then ended up being quite disappointed  It was 11euros for a cocktail and two gulps and it was gone  Very small glass     I was still hungry after my meal  I got the 8oz fillet of steak   it came out cold with the smallest scoop of mash and 2 baby carrots laid on top of the mash more for presentation look rather than quality   The dessert was very nice  It was the best part of the meal  I got the sticky toffee pudding and it was delicious  I didnt find the overall experience a good value for money  The restaurant was more about presentation rather than anything else  
R0151,"I ordered the Chicken Makhani  Butter Chicken  and the Lamb Saag  The entrees are  Euro 10 each and dont include rice or naan  Hardly the end of the world  but most places charge  Euro 10 11 and include boiled rice or naan for free 

The Chicken Makhani   Ordered medium spicy  but it fell flat when it came to spice  Most places usually just take some of their tandoori chicken and toss it in the sauce  or theyll use diced chicken breast  cheating  but at least it can be tasty   This place used a rather flavorless and greasy chicken  and there was only about as much meat as a large thigh  at most  

The Lamb Saag   Ordered medium spicy  also flat  Normally medium spicy makes my nose run  but I was nowhere near that  There was more lamb meat than my chicken had  but still only about 6 or so bites  to be fair  they were about 1cu inch each  and the rest was the spinach 

Naan was alright  Much thicker than Im used to  but thats not a pro/con  though it did break weird when trying to dip   and I didnt open the rice so I cant judge on that 

Given the other options nearby or through delivery  this is a pass for me "
R0151,I was overcharged  It seemed everything on the menu became dearer on the bill  I got some lettuce leaves and tomatoes and was charged  Euro 6  The dessert was bland and over priced  I had been there two nights previously and had a lovely night where everything was appropriately priced and charged and was really tasty  I was just very disappointed Friday night 
R0151,I was really disappointed in my night out at this place  This is my fourth time going and decided to bring my friends who have never been  My main issue was the wine list  On Friday 16th March  the 2 house wines and 2 other wines were off the list as they were out of stock  My issue is there was no alternative wines given at these prices  thus forcing your customers to choose more expensive wines  On St Patricks weekend I think it is pretty unbelievable for a restaurant to have run out of these wines and feel they were taking advantage of regulars and tourists alike  Pretty bad form I feel  I mentioned it to the waitress on the night but she was very unsympathetic to the situation  To me it is a matter of principal and unfortunately I will think twice before eating in this restaurant again 
R0151,Id give them 2 stars as I wasnt impressed at all by their spread
R0151,"Incredibly fast and very welcoming service 
Fantastic food and great ambience "
R0151,"It was not my first time there  and even if my first experience was not great I wanted to give it a second chance   We went for my boyfriends birthday  as I wanted to bring him to a special place   I made the staff aware that it was a special occasion  even though they made us sit on a small table beside a loud group of 20 people  We got steaks overcooked and hard to eat  Taking into account that each meal was 32euros  we did not expect to not be able to enjoy such a pricey meal  We also got desserts  that for the price we were expecting something done better  
Overall the food was not great like my first experience  and the price is a way to high for what they present 
I would recommend this place for the views and drinks  not for the food "
R0151,Its a lovely daytime hangout with loads of natural light and a hell of a view  Me and my buddies absolutely enjoyed the vibe  delicious food and friendly service 
R0151,Lovely decor but dont even think about eating there  The food belongs to an episode of Gordon Ramsays kitchen nightmares 
R0151,Lovely venue with poor food and service  Over priced 
R0151,My mum and I visited on Friday to celebrate getting my wedding dress that morning  We both ordered the same  Within 20 min of leaving the restaurant I became ill  my mum then began after 40 min  We had to rush home  We were ill for the rest of the evening and had to cancel my birthday meal out the following day  I emailed the restaurant and got no reply  I would never return though at the time I enjoyed the restaurant 
R0151,Nice staff  and great food  Very accomodating  quick service  the portions are good and space is pleasant and would definitely recommend  Will go back for sure
R0151,One of my highlights of my previous visit to Dublin was the key lime pie cocktail at this bar  But Im sad to say  this time it was just disappointing 
R0151,Poor service and expensive  Were seated next to a huge hen party 
R0151,"Portions were too small for the price 
When you phoned me on the day to confirm my booking you reminded me that table needed to be vacated by 8pm  I said ok no problem thanks 
When we arrived at the venue you again said table had to be vacated at 8pm  again I said ok no problem  
At 7 20pm again  we were reminded table had to be vacated by 8pm and again I said  ok no problem 
And when I was just about to ask for the bill      again staff member came to say our table needed to be vacated by 8pm 
I will not be returning to your venue due this   it was not a pleasant experience "
R0151,"Really disappointed  Girl who served us was rude  and  clearly wasnt listening to what I was ordering  and  found it difficult to multitask  I ordered the huevos rancheros without chorizo  my boyfriend ordered the full Irish  I tried to order an orange juice but she cut across me  and  gestured me to wait with her hand as she hadnt finished typing the food order  Then we asked for water  she told us ""as she said"" we would have to order water from another waitress  Again  not great at the multitasking  My meal came  of course with chorizo  I sent it back as I asked for it without   and  dont eat pork  The same dish came back  and  I was picking chorizo out of it still so could only eat around it  They took it off the bill but its hardly ideal  It was a simple order  she was distracted  and  rude  and  ruined our experience  It was Christmas Eve but half the tables were empty  Go to white friar grill if you want great food  and  service  First time in here   and  definitely the last "
R0151,Service was appalling   We had to look for someone to ask for everything    different size wine glasses   All the girls seem stressed and are rude   only smile was from the man who delivered the food  Would absolutely not go back   think forget about a restaurant and just have one big pub
R0151,Service was horrible  Table was booked  when we went for a cigarette outside all the things we left on the table including personal belongings  that were left there to show that we are not gone  were taken away by the barman  The Wine glasses were full of dust  When I ordered second bottle of wine the barman didnt even open it for me  The amount of people in the smoking area was too high  no place to stand   ash trays were full and the smoking area was cleaned once   we were in the restaurant from 9 30 1 00  website states that the bar is closing at 1 30 so thats the time I booked my taxi for  At 1 oclock we were kicked out saying that the bar is closing  Me and my friend had to wait outside for 30 min until my taxi arrived    Horrible service 
R0151,Service was very poor and ruined the whole meal  
R0151,So disappointed with our evening   I wouldnt even rate it out of 10   The food was average not very tasty but we were absolutely shocked when we got the bill   It is obvious to see now why they dont put their prices on the menu   ABSOLUTE ROBBERY  I have told my friends NOT to go there   Plenty of other nice places with delicious food and half the price    
R0151,The best restaurant in Dublin  the food  the attention and the ambient was wonderful 
R0151,The food was average and overpriced 
R0151,The food was delicious  the service was great  Overall a really great night out  thank you 
R0151,The view is alright  The food was so so when i was there  Seafood pasta wasnt al dente and seafood quality was average considering the price  My dad had a pizza and the temperature could be hotter  It can be a good place for drinks but im mot sure about the food 
R0151,"There were two of us  pre booked and we did not feel welcome  though my online account will show Ive been here often before  After securing a satisfactory table  despite the manager trying to fob us off re  non existent later arrivals  our orders were quickly taken by the exemplary waiting staff 
However  my very well cooked burger tasted different to usual and I feel it may have been very close to going off  which would account for the overcooking  Given the attitude of the manager  I did not complain  which was my fault  
My companion had no complaints about the food or wine "
R0151,This experience was not at all like previous visits Ive had   Would never normally review but we felt so deflated leaving  Table booked for 2  arrived at 2:15 due to traffic which was our fault completely  Our table was not ready for us  we waited in the bar until 2:30  Bar man was extremely rude to us while ordering drinks as we waited in the bar for our table to be ready  This really tainted the entire day for us  Table service was good  food came out almost straight away after we ordered it   normally would have expected at least 10 minutes break between ordering and eating   It was very sunny that day and the sun was shining in through the window into our eyes  I looked around and several other people were covering their eyes from the glare but nobody turned down the blind  Toilets were very cold  I believe there needs to be more of an emphasis on service for the prices being charged  Would consider other places before this for next time based on this experience which is unfortunate as I really really enjoyed it the last time  Maybe it was just an off day 
R0151,This place wont disappoint  Great food  staff  music and craic  What more do you want  Wish I lived closer  Id be there more often 
R0151,This was overall a terrible meal  and I would never recommend anyone eat here  Nothing about the experience from the food to the service was anything other than sub par 
R0151,To celebrate my birthday we went and the waitress made an honest mistake of taking our order however her machine died so it wasnt sent to the kitchen  After 45 minutes  with no food  the waitress came up and explained  Exactly 70 minutes are being seated we received are eggs on toast and heuvos rancheros   The bill arrived and nothing was deducted which we complained about  We were given 10 Euro  off which we felt was in no way significant after delaying us for the rest of the day  The manager came over and said that was the best he could do and when we said we wouldnt be returning he didnt seem to care in the slightest that he had unhappy customers  The way the management dealt with this situation was under standard and I would not recommend visiting this restaurant due to this level of service  Very unhappy
R0151,"Unfortunately I did not have a pleasant experience for this meal  It took the food 1hr 10mins to come  after we had starters 

We told the waitress and she was not helpful  She completely down played it and said we had only been waiting 40mins  This was untrue   100 percent  We told her we were unhappy and she actually made us feel like we were unreasonable  She said she would speak to the manager but then came back later with the bill and didnt mention anything 

We didnt pursue it further as we didnt want to cause a scene or for it to impact further on our night  Terrible service "
R0151,Very enjoyable experience  Great food  setting and service and the swing wasnt too bad either  
R0151,"Wait staff were quite rude and short with us despite the fact that it was not a busy evening 

Far from warm and friendly "
R0151,"Waitress rude  impossible to speak because it was too loud  food was disgusting  Waitress wait at least 15 min to take our order  When we said we would like to ordered she answered rudly : you were supposed to be 3 and act like she was upset 
She didnt listen when I was taking my order so she order the wrong pizza  She knew I send back the pizza but never say sorry    
The pizza arrived late and it was not tasty at all  my friend ordered gnocchi and it was hyper creamy hyper salty not tasty at all  Also  The gnocchi are not homemade  When we say it to the waitress she answer : you ordered creamy gnocchi so    
We asked to paid so we split the bill again she wasnt listen and got the wrong amount and when we said it was wrong she answered rudly : you told me this  
overall it was very bad And expensive for a poor quality"
R0151,Warm appetizers were served cold  
R0151,We booked a table for dinner and drinks and we shared main starters and pizzas and purchased multiple drinks  The waitress came over to us numerous times and told us that we were not welcome there as we had not ordered a main course each  If this was the case then it should have been put in the terms of the booking on online app when I made the booking  The waitress really made us feel very unwelcome and uncomfortable  We would have stayed and ordered more drinks and food but we decided to leave due to the unpleasant atmosphere created by the staff 
R0151,We liked the restaurant especially the ambience but our waiter  blonde lady  was very rude  She was acting as though she is doing us a favour by serving us   We wanted to make a complaint after brunch  14/04/2019  but decided to let it go 
R0151,We waited 40 minutes for the food  that was really overrated    
R0151,"Went here for my birthday dinner for the few days we were in Dublin  It came highly recommended because of the view  etc  which is pretty much the major reason Im giving it multiple stars; however  the service was terrible  The woman was not helpful at all when we asked questions about the menu and when we mentioned it was my birthday she didnt at the very least say ""happy birthday""  Honestly  we had better meals at places half the price around Dublin  I liked it for the view  but the service was below average for the price you pay for food "
R0151,"What can I say  this is definitely the most hyped restaurant in Dublin  The view  venue is amazing but the food can be better 

  Ordered Steak Filet  Medium Rare and got Medium Well 
  Ordered 2 portions of Fries  but they were still raw   Sent them back to the kitchen where they refried them and added an extra portion of Salt  
  The Coca Cola had no gas at all  basically drinking a cold syrup
  Was given the worst table ever  table 1  Behind me the pizza oven and the table where they put and grab all the cutlery  Asked 3 times for a different table but each time they just gave it to another guest

Conclusion  not ideal place for drinks but for dinner no "
R0151,Why is there so much hype about this place     It nothing spectacular at all or nothing near it the burgers are atrocious the meat is over cooked  Service so slow   snails would be betterMore
R0151,Wonderful  fresh  authentic Italian food  �Gluten free pasta option for one of us  great wine selection   and the housemade pesto was amazing 
R0151,"Wow  This is great place to eat  From there look of the outside bar it didnt look like it but boy i was wrong  The inside was very clean and the ambiance was great  There food were tasty and yummy  My hubby ordered the house special ""chicken n leek pie"" and the rosemary n garlic fries and i ordered the chicken pasta on our last night in Dublin  It was by far the best meal we had sitting our stay in Ireland  The staff were very friendly  helpful and attentive  So thank you so much for making our last stay a great night "
R0152,Abouslouty bueatiful breakfast coffee staff are the best and so friendly no waiting time and so clean
R0152,Always enjoy this place  Great attentive staff  Wine menu is decent and the food is simply but tasty 
R0152,As a Cocktail bar for drinks yes   but your food offering a very definite no 
R0152,As always excellent service  delicious food  and  cocktails in a great atmosphere  The staff are lovely  Looking forward to going back 
R0152,Bar review  Bartender was extremely rude and unhelpful  All I did was ask for a beer and was given a huge dose of crap  
R0152,Bit disappointed that we had movie booked for 9 pm and and we were told that at 8:15 we had to leave as the 2 hour booking was over  They had no where to go between booking and cinema time  They either need to allow extra time for those going to cinema or have an area to go to  The staff were not very helpful and when we asked about staying g at the bar we were told no  No attempt was made to try and accommodate us  I find this to be very poor service
R0152,Booked dinner for 4 people at 5 15pm  last Saturday   Were seated at a table with 3 chairs and a very low stool   Table was right beside the bar  Staff refused to give us a fourth chair or to move us to one of the many empty tables   Staff were very unwelcoming and service was extremely slow  We were told we had 30 minutes to finish up our desserts and drinks to vacate the table  There were still other unoccupied tables   Food was fine   Wouldnt be in a rush back
R0152,Cant fault the staff and service but the food needs a complete overhaul  Food was Cold when arrived  sent back  and received reheated  dried up hard to eat  tasteless food in Return 
R0152,Cocktails were a bit disappointing   Service was quite slow even though there only three tables occupied   They did not have one of the drinks requested   Wicklow Wolf beer   and we had to go to the downstairs bar to get this   They did not offer to get it for us 
R0152,Cocktails were slow to come and very poor wyslity
R0152,Despite having stated I was a coeliac when booking there was very poor choice  I was told salmon was all right but when it was cooked they discovered it wasnt gluten free and had to cook another piece which was undercooked  The Manager stepped in and said we would not have to pay for what we had ordered and he certainly saved the evening for us  especially when my husband was in the long queue before the film and he got us a glass of wine and popcorn and brought it to our seat 
R0152,"Difficult to rate  The staff were very nice but unfortunately not informative  Booking was for 8 15 so we ordered a drink and then when ordering our second drinks we ordered some small bites  at 9   At this stage we were told that the kitchen was busy with movie orders and so advised to wait to order more food  We said fine and had another drink  The time passes quickly and so it was 10 15 by the time we ordered our food at which stage we were informed for the first time that the kitchen closed at 10      so no food despite the fact that we were out for dinner   
Then  having put in our drink order we were told that they needed our table back and that we should have known it was a 2 hour booking because it was written in the small print  This was a very disappointing experience despite the fact that the staff all seemed nice and were helpful as regards drinks knowledge etc     we should have been informed that table was for 2 hours only and that the kitchen closed at 10 
I would recommend to others but only after advising them of the above     "
R0152,Drinks added to my bill no apology or anything very bad service
R0152,Everything good  Its just a pity the veggie burger was such a let down 
R0152,Exemplary as it is always lovely way to meet friends have some excellent food and see a movie  Rocketman  in luxurious surroundings not a cheap night out but well worth every euro   Highly recommended 
R0152,Fantastic venue  Fab Art Dec style furnishings  Surprisingly however I felt it lacked atmosphere  Maybe it was the night that was in it but it was extremely cold  Our party of 6 literally sat with our coats on  as did several other people  After about an hour of this we asked if there was any way it could be made warmer  and they obliged  But the cold definitely took away from the night  If it was warm and Cosy the athmosphere would have been much better  Also despite several staff moving around it was very hard to get service  I dont know what They were so busy doing but it was impossible to get their attention to order a drink  However I will definitely give it the benefit of the doubt and try again but I think Ill wait for Warmer weather 
R0152,Food a little cold everything arrived together not very hot so not very nice to eat  Difficult to get the attention of servers 
R0152,I wouldnt return to this place   too spicy and too busy  I definitely dont recommend it 
R0152,GreAt   we will be back
R0152,Great drinks      window seat was freezing   The food is only grand but lovely environment relaxed place to sit and sip 
R0152,Great find in Dublin  flat bread wrap with the spicy chicken filling  beetroot hummus and taztiki  wraps are large but delicious x
R0152,"Great location and surroundings   thats really what you are paying for 
Price of cocktails are outrageous for the size of them and the food is pretty standard if not slightly supermarket quality for the price 
Go for the experience but bring your credit card and dont hold out for exquisite dining"
R0152,The real disappointment here for me was the service; it was slow and disinterested which spoilt an otherwise nice its Friday lets not have a sandwich at the desk lunch 
R0152,I was very much looking forward to trying out this place as not a huge amount of choice in the area and I heard some good things about the food  I have been for brunch twice now  The first time I was relatively pleased with the experience   the food was good  I had heuvos rancheros  but not sold on the service  Wait times were a bit on the long side and the staff werent the most welcoming  However I am willing to put that aside for good food  so I went back today to give it another go  Im sorry to say my second experience was very disappointing  When we arrived we werent greeted or acknowledged for about 5 mins  Then a man behind the counter told us Were very busy  so yeah   Eventually a waitress told us it would be a 20 min wait because the kitchen was backed up despite there being lots of free tables  I appreciated that they were under pressure so I waited for the table  When we sat down  we had to wait about 20 mins for our order to be taken  The waiter told us only at that point that they were out of both of the dishes we wanted to order  He also said to my partner who settled on heuvos rancheros that they didnt have time to be making salsa so the dish wouldnt include it  When we eventually got our food  after 40 mins   they gave me the wrong dish  At that stage I was so starving I didnt want to send it back  The food was very nice but home fries were undercooked and cold  When we were leaving  at 2pm   they had put up the closed sign on the door despite having posted on Facebook that brunch would run until 3pm  There were some very disappointed customers arriving at the door only to be turned away  Disappointing experience to say the least 
R0152,"I would only recommend the place as a pre movie venue   Tables are only available for two hours  regardless of how much youre spending  Once your two hours are up  youre asked to leave  even if you still have full drinks  and there is nowhere else to go unless theres space in the cinema lobby which isnt much of an option   

Its a beautiful room and could be a fab place to spend an evening  but thats not what theyre offering unfortunately "
R0152,I would recommend for drinks only  loved the venue  staff v courteous  great atmosphere but ordered food at 8 10 for 9 15 cinema   in fairness  they did apologize and didnt charge us for the food but food had to be delivered to our cinema seats and came at 9 45 hour and a half for v greasy deep fried prawn tempura   deep fried beef thingy and deep fried fish taco    extremely disappointing food service   staff venue cinema etc great  but need to get the food service sorted   will be eating elsewhere first next time Im afraid
R0152,In fact we already have recommended it to our friends 
R0152,Lovely place  beautiful atmosphere  great service and tasty food 
R0152,Loving it    service from James was excellent  Very welcoming    lovely day overall  Wine was great too
R0152,My first visit was amazing so I was delighted to invite other friends to experience it  Unfortunately we were disappointed from the start  Delayed drinks  incorrect orders  kitchen ran out of plates so served our food up in paper dishes fit for hot dogs  our side places were saucers    Excuse given was the arrival of a party of 15pax  Surely with your prebooking system youre already aware of how many to expect and your kitchen can cater for the number of covers in the room   not acceptable  Would have loved to have considered this venue as a place to celebrate a birthday but very doubtful now following my recent experience 
R0152,Nice food  friendly staff     Will come back definitely  Cosy place for a romantic dinner or a casual drink 
R0152,Nice place but poor service food served cold and was dripping in grease   told waitress never saw her again    Someone else brought us the bill and she said she would mention it to the kitchen    We ordered the food early but was very late just to deliver the starter and had no time to order main coarse    Seems like to many managers telling the floor staff what to do but they made no effort themselves to help out   they do not work as a team and no prices in the menu    And they dont give you side plates so you had to eat the starters from the dish they were cooked / served in   So just have a drink leave the food   
R0152,overpriced  and  greasy  if you have a choice dont go here  taste isnt terrible but there are many other options around
R0152,"Perhaps my expectations for this bar were too high  Initially the service was good but went downhill once we had been seated and had placed our order  
I felt that the staff were not attentive and we were left waiting quite a while when looking to speak to someone  This was despite the bar being almost completely empty; the staff were casually chatting and doing some minor tidying at the bar  I felt that the drink I ordered was poorly made and I was not happy  but I was not quality checked so I do not think the staff realise that I felt this way "
R0152,Ran out of glasses  cutlery  sparkling water  Items on the food menu were no longer on the menu 
R0152,"Really enjoyed the cinema experience and the cocktail club was the icing afterwards 
Cocktail choice was a bit limited but you can have regular drinks too would highly recommend checking it it"
R0152,Seating arrangement was poor  one on couch and one on chair perpendicular to each other  If one say back the other had to sit forward for the duration so not relaxing  I highlighted this to our server when paying 
R0152,"Solid food but questionable service 

Best prepared to do a lot of waiting and getting to experience receiving your meal in a novel order  To be fair  they were friendly  but man was it annoying "
R0152,Staff kept ignoring us and being rude  We had to borrow menu from next table  We spent most of our time trying to get staffs attention instead of enjoying what was supposed to be a romantic date  it was worst than a touristic pub  A shame and a waste of money  so disappointing   Im already warning my friends to a avoid this place 
R0152,Staff were great  music also excellent and drinks selection was second to none
R0152,Super experience as usual  Love the restaurant Thank you to all the staff 
R0152,Table booked for six people  Arrived on time and there was no table available  We all left  Wouldnt recommend to anybody  very poor management service and extremely disapointed 
R0152,The bar itself is beautiful but after ordering it took 30 minutes to get our cocktail  Then they tried to charge us for 4 
R0152,The room is superb  elegant and plush with funky carpet and lovely soft lighting  The food could be improved but the cocktails  atmosphere and surroundings are perfect 
R0152,The service was really poor on the night guys 
R0152,The smashed basil gin cocktail had 2 melted cubes of ice and one tiny basil leaf  The glass it was served in was a tumbler  We got a bottle of wine but had to wait a while for glasses  We were told that the bar was out of glasses  The prosecco was almost flat  One of the burgers we ordered had been taken off the menu but was still on the menu that we were offered  There were no prices on the menu  We had to wait for cutlery as stocks had to be replenished  There was no sparkling water available  The lounge is fabulously decorated but it has a long way to go on service 
R0152,The waiters were so ill mannered and the sevice was soo bad     and the prices were much higher than similar resturants
R0152,They do a really nice coffee here and the staff are very friendly 
R0152,"This is the first and only time Ive felt guilty paying the check 
Im writing this review steps from the bathroom  as Im still unsure if I have shellfish poisoning from the rotten oysters we were served  The oysters that werent rotten were ridden with bits of shell  with only 2 out of the dozen we ordered being clear of bits 

We were given no napkins and we had to donate our silverware to the table behind us  as they didnt even have that 

For the whole crab  disregarding the bland taste  we were given one pick between the two of us 

Lastly  as we begrudgingly paid the check  the waitress dropped our credit card in the crab juice that was still on the uncleared plate  handing it back to us "
R0152,"This was a last min date idea with the partner  The food was hit and miss  I had rosemary potatoes that tasted of nothing with a bit of sauce thrown atop  I also had the meat balls which despite a hair were quiet nice 

After complaint to the manager he offered me a free drink  but I dont drink so I got nothing  Still paid full price and found the staff very lax and uninterested  I will not return "
R0152,"This was our first time at the cocktail club  We were celebrating my dads 60th birthday with yous  But we all felt ignored by the staff  The food was a bit cold and one of the mocktails I ordered was a waste of 4 50 as the glass used was full of ice and little bit of the cocktail was in it  So it was a really bad first experience 

I hope you improve your standards "
R0152,Three of us met before a NCH event  The food was excellent and we had excellent advice for wine choice  Such a lovely place  The staff are lovely
R0152,Unbelievable Irish luck  We were staying around the corner and it was recommended for a great steak  We called in and a table had just cancelled  We popped into the pub next door and waited until 8 30 for a table  The steak was amazing  Loved it  
R0152,Very disappointed  Booked for 2 people over 2 weeks ago  Was given a table in a corner where we could hardly breathe  Breeze coming up d stairs  changed to seats at bottom of stairs to smoking area where we got raft of smoke every time d door opened  service was efficient and pleasant 
R0152,"Very disappointing  My wife and I regularly visit another club and always enjoy our visit 
Upon arriving at this Club  we were seated at a very noisy section and asked to be moved  The waiter who met us was not welcoming in any way  My wife asked for a Cocktail which was not listed on the menu  however all of the required ingredients were listed on the menu  We were told that it was not possible as they did not have pineapple juice  There was no attempt made to suggest a similar alternative  The food was very average  The other Club provide an excellent Service  the staff and food are exceptional  This Club is a long way off the mark  I would not be in a hurry back  Big improvements are required "
R0152,very pleasant time   will definitely return   service was very good   food tasty   cocktails were great  
R0152,Waitress was absolutely fabulous  very friendly  crisp service and great chat  food was delicious  and drinks prepared to perfection 
R0152,Was stoked to get a table here to celebrate a friends new job  But got seated at a not very nice dark corner table  I objected  was told waitresses do not assign the tables to the reservations  they d need to ask a manager to move me  Ok  do  There were vacant tables  Was then told the manager was on the phone  they couldnt speak to them  Ok  Was then told the person who I had been dealing with was now on a break  Ok  But that I could have a seat at a table by the servers station  Ok  I took it  had a mediocre overpriced cocktail  and  left  Wont be back  Check out my pictures from my club evening  as one friend noted theres even a nice plastic bin beside me  What a joke
R0152,"We had been advised to book a table before the cinema in order to get the full experience   I went online and booked the cinema for 9 00 p m  and the system would only allow me to book the table from 6 30 � 8 30   This all made sense to me  supper  rest break and then down to the cinema   We arrived  ordered food  wine  cocktails and beer   Whilst ordering another girl came over and asked us if we would like to order � a simple mistake   Perhaps if the staff didnt spend so much time chatting at the tills and spent more time looking at the guests and the room such a mistake wouldnt happen 
Our food arrived and it was very tasty and nicely presented   We ate and chatted and had a generally lovely time   It came to 8 20 and the girl came over and quite strongly asked us if we were aware we had booked the table form 6 30 � 8 30   Such a perfunctory announcement made in front of my guests was quite embarrassing   I told her that yes  I was aware   She then shoved the bill onto the table   I was quite shocked at the behaviour   What had been a lovely evening thus far suddenly turned into shoving us out the door   I put my card in the wallet with the bill and went to the ladies   On my way I counted four empty tables in the room and wondered why we were being pushed out so strongly   When I got back the girl  in my opinion  had become quite stroppy   I paid the bill and was putting my card back into my wallet when another server came over and started removing everything from our table � to the point that one of my guests turned around and told her that yes  we were leaving  could they calm down until we at least got our coats on   We left the table at 8 32    What a pity   I sent this feedback to the info email address and got no response   Be warned   Improvement needed  "
R0152,We loved it  after May 22  We left a  Euro 10 tip  Thank you 
R0152,We stayed at the nearby Hotel but still would have finished off our night in this pub every night we were in Dublin  Great variety of Irish music 
R0152,Were told because of an issue with a film starting our food would be delayed by half and hour  After half an hour we were told it would be another half hour  Staff were apologetic but we left
R0153,After finding this cafe online I was expecting great things instead I was greatly disappointed the food and service were both mediocre
R0153,After visiting this place yesterday for Breakfast  we left feeling a little disappointed due to mainly the customer service  
R0153,"booked as a social occasion  Table wasnt ready on time  20mins late   Booked for 7 45pm didnt want to give me evening menu even thou early bird finished at 7  Starter was meant to be lemon INFUSED chicken but what I got was a watery cheap sliced chicken with a lump of skin on top with some sort of weird orange sauce on top  Other half got chowder  Seemed ok  When I returned the salad i wasnt asked what was wrong or if I wanted a replacement  

My duck  mains  was lovely as was my partners lamb  

Staff just seemed disinterested "
R0153,Confusing menu� 
R0153,Decent food  nothing special but expected for a touristy place  �Service was VERY slow  Nothing worthy to speak of 
R0153,"Disappointed with this restaurant 
Was refused the Al Carte Menu and told I had to order from the pre theatre menu which was more expensive  
Food was not good and very small portions "
R0153,Enjoyed everything about this place  ambience  food and music    Easy location with good staff  well be back 
R0153,Excellent food and great wine selection  Fabulous attentive service
R0153,Food was lukewarm  and  desserts tiny  bite size  overpriced at  Euro 28
R0153,Four of us attended for dinner  and  ordered drinks in the Lobby Area  we waited approx  20 minutes for the drinks to arrive  and  we had to go to find out what the delay was  When the drinks arrived the raspberries in the gin  and  Tonics were mouldy when we informed the staff we were another 10 minutes waiting on replacement drinks  In the restaurant the service was very slow  our plates were cold  one of the group ordered the pasta specifically with no cheese and it arrived with cheese  she had to wait a further 10 minutes for a new pasta to be made  even though the waitress was apologetic the whole experience was totally unsatisfactory and not what we would have expected
R0153,Friendly helpful staff but disappointing food for dinner  Breakfast was better
R0153,Geez  �Upon arrival we were thinking we picked a great spot  �They then proceeded to seat us by the fire extinguishers when there was other seating  �Our waitress could barely speak English  �We suspect she was Polish  � 
R0153,"God so disappointed with service and over priced drinks   food 
Seated outside not busy but wateress was so slow   to even serve us a menu  "
R0153,Had quite a few misogynistic encounters with the owner  Asking females to smile and making cheeky jokes while rubbing his own nipples  Literally a gross display of a man beyond how demeaning he is towards females  His prices are going up so dont let the cheap factor let you support the patriarchy 
R0153,Had the pre theatre meal not much on the plate could have been a little better with more on the plate service was good young waiter was very friendly with really good english i wouldnt be rushing back  i did feel hungry when i got home 
R0153,I also treated myself to a this pretty raspberry and prosecco drink  My friend didnt like the way there were bits at the end
R0153,I arrived with my daughters for their birthdays   I booked online but there was nothing in book for reservations   We got the set menu and had to ask for  a la pcrate menu no wine menu was given    We ordered starters and main course after asking what special was one of my daughters ordered that    When main courses came my daughter did nt get what she ordered so we swopped main courses as there was no specials left and it was very confusing between all the waiting staff  We waited over a half hour for dessert I asked for ice cream but it was one scoop   Asked for bill more confusion   Not itemized  just given a price well over the set menu value with 2 drinks   There was a company do on roof which was very noisy    Was the most disorganized restaurant I ever used   I went after gettin a flyer through letter box did not get free dessert after using the word local by phone on line etc   staff were nice but service really bad   
R0153,I completed a comment card outlining the issues giving my email address so I would have expected an email as a matter of courtesy  Side order of vegetables didnt arrive with meal   had to remind two members of staff about them  Meal was almost finished by time they arrived  Ordered 3 teas and coffees and a jug with enough milk for only one coffee was brought  Asked three different staff for more milk    Id have milked a cow in the time it took to get it  My tea was strong and luke warm by time it arrived   Having complained and advised staff that we wouldnt be leaving a tip we were asked if wed like some dessert   I presume this was going to be free   though that wasnt clear  but as it was now 7pm and we were going to a 7 30 show we declined   given how slow it had been to get the vegetable order and milk  The restaurant was not busy and there seemed to be plenty of staff so there really was no excuse for the poor service 
R0153,I have found this place to be cold  and it smells a bit like lavatory cleaner  Another reviewer also said the same  Not sure how everyone else seems to just ignore that
R0153,I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS OK   THERE WASNT A GREAT SELECTION ON THE MENU   I AM NOT A BIG MEAT EATER BUT THE BEEF WAS THE ONY THING I WOULD GO FOR AND I LEFT MOST OF IT   ALSO I THINK THE CHIPS WHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE EARLY BIRD MENU   DIDNT THINK IT WAS GOOD VALUE REALY   NEARLY 40 EACH AND WE ONLY HAD ONE GLAS OF WINE EACH 2 MAINS AND A STARTER AND DESSERT     WOULDNT BE RUSHING BACK UNLESS MENU WAS EXPANDED   I WENT BEFORE WHEN I GOT A VOUCHER ON GROUPON AND IT WAS GOOD VALUE BUT AS FAR AS I CAN SEE IT IS STILL THE SAME MENU AND THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO
R0153,Its been over half an hour and still waiting on food  customer service very bad and when we asked when our food will be ready the waiter just shrugged us off and walked away  Wont be coming back to this place  disgraceful 
R0153,Ive traveled all over the world eating Indian food  This was the worst I have ever had  Chicken tikka masala   more like sweet and sour chicken  Lamb curry   is this goat  Not good at all  Garlic naan   waste of time  Speaking of time  2 hours to get to my hotel  �Waste of 40 euros  I ordered from another Indain place two nights prior  Had our food in 30 minutes flat and it was one of the best places I have ever tried  Dont order from this place
R0153,"Maybe a bad day: they had lots of people  However we waited 25 min and no server came to us  Food quality of the chicken salad was sub par: some shreds of cooked chicken drumstick meat  the mixed greens  had wilted and soggy leaves between the crisp leaves 
The manager was lovely and helped us immediately when he found it we have a tight time frame "
R0153,Mediocre food experience 
R0153,"On the run  �And in need of a good sandwich  �Well youll find it right here  �Ive gone here a couple of times  and its simply convenient  �The pricing isnt so bad  and neither is the taste of their sandwiches  �Quite scrumptious if you ask me  �Heres what Ive tried: �

~ The RUBY   Euro 5 50 : �Made with a healthy serving of kanturk pastrami  add some saurkraut  slap on the swiss cheese  glide some horseradish on rye bread and youre golden  �If you order this for breakfast  then you best eat it while its hot  �But also not bad if you plan to save it for lunch  �
~ The HAM and CHEESE   Euro 5 50 : �Made with ham hock slices and grilled gruyere cheese  a couple of tomatoes  some pickles  and all put together between some toasted sour dough  �Cant say its the best hamncheese ever  as most yelpers have mentioned   but it wasnt the worst  �Delish  �
~ Regular Coffee   Euro 2 20 : �Bold and aromatic  �Full flavored  and kept me awake  �Great way to start your day 

I dig it  �Ill be back "
R0153,Overall experience was awful   Can only rate the food based on breakfast  We booked the table 3 months in advance I was not aware that only a pre theatre set menu would be available before 7 30   booking was at 5 45  so could not even get a steak or a pizza  such poor choice  Our order was taken  by the restaurant manager  at approximately 6pm and we were told we would be waiting 15 minutes for our soup starter and 20 25 minutes for our main course which was chicken  I also ordered a glass of wine  At 6 20 I had to ask again for my wine which eventually I got  A waiter came to our table twice with other peoples orders  Maybe around this time the manager walked past and saw we had no soup and he said he would check at this time we notice a couple who arrived well after us had gotten their starter  We found the manager and told him cancel the soup and we were getting caught for time we then came back to our table and said the chicken would be 3 minutes this was now 6 30 after arriving at 5 45  So by 6 40 we got up and left on the way out we said to the manger we had no time to wait he replied that I said it would be 3 minutes in which we said that was 10 minutes ago  He just said sorry Im sorry but at this stage was not good enough 
R0153,Really disappointed booked for 530   When we arrived at 520 the person who came to us and looked around and said there were no seats and he told us to stand   Eventually another fellow seated us into another part of restaurant to keep it short it took 1 and 3/4 hours till we had ate our meal which was in no way good but didnt complain as we would never have gotten out didnt have time for tea as we were going to a concert the whole thing just spoiled our evening as we were too late then to meet up with our friends for a drink will never be back here
R0153,Restaurant was the breakfast room  cafeteria setting  The table we booked  online  the restaurant didnt have a record of  The menu was fine but the food was awful  It had not been seasoned  had no taste  was very over cooked and sauce was of a water consistency  There was no atmosphere or ambience  Really disappointing  Staff were pleasant and on complaint we were advised we would not have to pay for our dinner
R0153,They werent exactly busy either at 3 on a Saturday afternoon  The burger  in fairness  wasnt bad but the miserly portion of chubby chips were very poor value at 3 95 and I felt had been restored from frozen in the very recent past  Very meh and poor value overall 
R0153,Staff pleasant but inefficient  Waiting too long for courses  Had pre theatre menu  limited choice but should have been much tastier as only three options to prepare  Hake dish wasnt edible  Chicken dish ok  Very disappointing as had wonderful trip to matinee performance of Les Mis  Overpriced for what was served  Nice surroundings 
R0153,Staff were polite and it was a lovely setting but we had to wait for almost an hour for our starter and then another 30 minutes once we finished the starter for our main  Main dishes were served cold and I not cooked as requested  I e I asked me medium well and got medium rare  Very expensive for what we got and was not up to expectations
R0153,Terrible experience  First off  we booked online  and got confirmation of our booking to be told by the restaurant staff that they did not have the booking  We were over 50 minutes waiting for food  the restaurant was not busy and we got an excuse that it was because we ordered beef which took 25 mins to cook  I complained and got 10 percent discount  When the foid did arrive   ordered a burger without cheese  and it came with the cheese  Overall  would never dine there again 
R0153,Terrible service  Staff mocked us after not understanding their horribly designed menu 
R0153,The Maitre D was very quite rude   very disappointed
R0153,"The menu that was on their web site is not active 
We had no choice but to go for the bar menu 
The order took 30 minutes to arrive and when it
did it was cold  The worst dining experience I have
had ever "
R0153,The most awful dining expieriences ever   what should of been a wonderful mother/daughter time was ruined by the awful expierience we had here   we waited 40 minutes from seating to starter   Then gave ourselves indigestion as when mains did arrive we had to rush to make show  we arrived at 5 30 and left at 7 10 we only had starter of which was soup and pate   not alot of cooking  and main steak   again not alot of cooking  our drinks order arrived as we asked for bill   The worse place i have ever ate  service was atrocious and the food not much better  chips that were like crisps  overcooked soggy veg and a steak that was mostly fat  what should of been a memorable night is now for the wrong reasons 
R0153,The perfect pre theatre experience  Choice not massive but a good enough range for all but the most fussy diner 
R0153,"The reservation wasnt on their books despite being confirmed earlier  We were seated and only presented with the set menu  Id rang earlier in the day to ensure both menus were available as my parents wouldnt eat anything on the set menu and was assured they were  I had to request the other menu and we were only given one to share between three of us  Upon ordering we were told it would take 40 minutes to prepare any order off the other menu which despite seeming excessive we were fine with  
The waitress came and kept asking did we want butter we were confused by this and after a few minutes trying to work out what she meant we discovered she meant did we want bread to start with which we declined 
We ordered 2 steaks which came with vegetables and chunky chips per the menu and a burger with chips   The steaks arrived with vegetables however no chips after 35 minutes waiting  The burger and chips came together  We asked where the chips were for the steaks and were told theyd take another few minutes  The vegetables with the steak were cold and the steak was lukewarm  When the chips arrived about 5 minutes later they were in baskets and put straight onto the table cloth not onto a serving plate  We asked for tomato ketchup and were given one small portion suitable for one to share between three of us and had to request more  The tomato sauce was very poor quality and tasted like a generic budget brand  At no point were our water glasses refreshed or were we asked if we wanted to order more drinks  You cant pay the bill at the table by card  They give you the bill and youve to get up and go to the front desk  
Great potential but poor service and food that wasnt worth the wait "
R0153,The restaurant it self is lovely and the staff were very courteous and friendly but service was extremely slow   We were booked in for a preshow dinner for 5 30pm and ended up being late for the show   There was too much time between courses and although there seemed to be 3 or 4 staff only 1 girl seemed to be serving   The menu is very basic and limited  we could not understand how it took so long for our food to be served especially desert which you imagine is pre prepared but took 20 minutes to come out   Such a pity as it is a lovely hotel and an ideal location   Would not go back 
R0153,"The staff were pleasant  the surroundings are great and the nachos and salads were good  

Even so  I was really disappointed over all by my most recent visit  Some of the food we got was below mediocre  
A couple of the dishes were drowned in mayonnaise and the calamari was under cooked and rubbery  

While the calamari was removed from the bill  it shouldnt have been put on the table in the first place "
R0153,The staff were very friendly there was not a lot of food on the plate and there wasnt much of a taste sorry we wont be returning to the restaurant and I wont be recommending it to my friends didnt think it was good value for the money  
R0153,This is a great restaurant for food and entertainment   Book the grill counter and watch the chefs in action 
R0153,"This is probably the most overrated restaurant in Ireland  They offer ""Asian fusion"" which is honestly so mediocre and full of SUGAR i felt like i was eating candy  Not only is the chef mediocre  but the manager was completely rude "
R0153,The chips were luke warm  the actual size of the chips more like chip sticks  embarrassing portion 
R0153,veg was frozen veg that can be bought in Tesco it was also over cooked the broccoli was barely still green  The rest of the food was ok but bland not worth the Money they charged   Waiting staff were very plesent and friendly only mark down was after dinner we ordered a glass of wine and coffee to go with dessert but they had forgotten to bring them so we had to ask again   Over all its ok if you want something easy before you see a a show in the theater but I could have definitely made something more tasty at home 
R0153,Very disappointed overall  Special occasion ruined  Very bad service in spite of early bird booking for Theatre  Food didnt arrive all together and had to ask several times for it  Childrens menu wouldve fed 3 children  Wouldnt go back and wouldnt recommend
R0153,Very disappointed with the slow service on Sunday evening  The restaurant was only half full but waited too long for dinner  We booked this as a Pre theatre menu so they knew we had to be out before 7  30  Did not have time for desert so they are actually losing money by not speeding up the service  However the food was good and worth the money 
R0153,Very disappointing  Had booked for a special friend pre theatre  The lemon infused chicken salad consisted of a few miserable bits of fatty grizzly chicken  My friend is a vegetarian and ordered the trout dinner without the trout because the sides with it sounded nice  We are still not sure what was in the potato  that came with this  it was just awful  She also got 2 pieces of turnip  We had ordered chips and steamed greens  The chips were burnt  The only edible thing was the steamed broccoli and green beans  We left before desert   there was no waitress to be seen at that stage and there were lots of people waiting to order  We left and had a gorgeous desert in a nearby hotel and were so sorry we hadnt gone there in the first place  This is the first review I have ever written  I am not a complainer  but the quality of the food here is very poor  And it was way over priced  Never again 
R0153,Very poor service along with poor food and not even a seat in the restaurant proper combined to deliver a �less than optimum� experience 
R0153,Very very �poor customer service ; food not fresh  cutlery not clean � and  overall staff are crap ; worst kabab place in Dublin   I would not go there anymore even I wouldnt like recommended anyone  
R0153,We ate at the pub on our way to a gig  The best fish and chips ever  Friendly staff and huge selection of craft beers and whiskys  Ill be back  
R0153,"We came here to try somewhere different  bad mistake 

Although to be fair we had dishes from the Chinese menu  the Korean BBQ I saw someone having looked OK 

Why 2 stars 

Expensive  really expensive compared to other places in the area  I think it was 14 euro for a standard dish with rice  Now if that dish had been a hand cooked delight fair enough  But basically it was takeaway food  

We had sweet and sour chicken    looked like a sauce from a bottle  and chicken balls from a bag  

I had a Black Bean Beef dish  it was pretty poor  I left most of it  The chicken dish was at least eatable 

My rice was actually pretty awful as well  Never had bad boiled rice from a Chinese restaurant before  It was cold and tasted starchy as well  I think it had been sitting out for a while waiting to be put on a plate  

Service was pretty good and a nice interior hence  plus the Korean BBQ looked a bit better so Ive given it 2 stars  But I wont be back "
R0153,We had a nice meal and the staff were very friendly but a little slow  The food was good and we would come back again 
R0153,We had an amazing dinner experience in this restaurant  Highly recommend  We had no desert  but I wish I had space in my stomach 
R0153,"We ordered a pasta with sausage and an appetizer platter  and while I have no complaints about the appetizers and in fact really enjoyed the rice balls  the pasta was undercooked  more than just al dente  and there was definitely something about the sauce which said ""microwaved""  "
R0153,we waited 25 minutes for our drinks to arrive at the table after we ordered them i had to call the waiter to remind him the resturant was not that busy even though there was a concert at the theatre i had requested by e mail that i would dine a la carte but on arrival i was informed that all i could get was the theatre menu until 7 30 i had no time to book elsewere  the food or the service was not impressive would not dine here again
R0153,We were very disappointed with our experience  It was obvious from the start that the staff were under pressure  The girl on reception was also serving food and clearing tables so we waited 10 mins to be seated our booking was for 6pm and we arrived at 6 55  Our starters arrived promptly and were nice though the soup could have been much hotter  However we were then waiting 50 mins for our mains and had to ask 3 times  We were heading to the Bord Gais for a 7 30 show  Our main course arrived at 7 05  Two of the party ordered leg of lamb which had very little meat and mostly fat  The vegetables were cold  We had to cancel our deserts and didnt have time for tea and coffee   This was very disappointing as it was a special night out for my mum  Overall we were very unhappy  There appeared to very few staff serving  The manager was apologetic and took my number and name  However I have yet to receive a call 
R0153,"When I saw they had cronuts I was so excited  Light pillows of crossaint dough cut to donut shape and fried  Then covered as you please 

Their cronut was however skull soul crushing  while it had a few layers  they were wet  heavy and gluey  Not the Light crispy texture I was hoping for 

Thinking maybe it was just the time I went  10 Sunday morning  I stopped in Monday at 8  �

My lemon cronut might have been worse than the first  Snickers topped   This time it was quite cold like they are made way ahead and stored in the fridge to get soggy 

I am also a lover of good croissants  Krust is consistent here with serving soggy  limp croissants that have no flavour or aroma to suggest the bakery even heard of butter 

In summary they serve beautiful looking food that is an utter disappointed "
R0154,First breakfast here in Ireland  very trendy but typical Irish food with many options  Beautiful patio to see the square and people watch 
R0154,"""All fur and no knickers"" sums up my experience here  While the welcome and service was relatively good  the food was nothing special and ultimately disappointing  A word to the sommelier  when you run out of stock of the wine that the customer orders for the second time  the correct practice would be to offer another similar bottle at the same price  The coffee was rubbish "
R0154,"1  The worst food you could possibly buy 
2  They are extremely rude 
3  The food isnt cooked to order 
4  Sauces cost extra  Euro 2 which does not makes sense 

I came in at 12:00 to order food  after ordering my food I asked for extra sauce for my food and the waiter started coursing at me because I wasnt �willing to pay him the extra money  I would highly recommend you check out a different place before coming here  �This place is sad "
R0154,"Amazing  Service was outstanding  and  food was delicious   
Will definitely back  First time here  and  definitely wont be the last  
Highly recommend it "
R0154,Beautiful food and amazing service   coffee was top notch too      I had the haloumi and fried eggs which were cooked to perfection
R0154,"Been wanting to visit for ages  appears frequently in newspaper/ online lists of top vegetarian restaurants worldwide  plus I have the brilliant Cornucopia Cookbook  Got the chance on Monday morning  26 February 2018  Its a casual restaurant where you queue up  order  pay for your food  then find a table with tray in hand  Canteen style  no table service here  

It was quiet with just a couple of people already queueing up for breakfast when we arrived  Despite this  the lady behind the counter was slow at serving and our party of four had quite a wait  We ordered two cooked breakfasts  sausage  scrambled tofu etc   one porridge and one pancake  The food was delicious  but staff and the horrendous service they offered really let Cornucopia down  

Blonde Lady who plated our food took forever to do so  then passed said plates to a Brunette Lady at a till  So  we had to queue to order  then queue again at a till to pay whilst our food sat on plates going cold  When we did eventually get to the till  Brunette took forever to provide us with coffee and toast  We had to stand waiting for ages as she toasted bread and got coffees/teas  It was ridiculous  I was so fed up waiting I told her I didnt want any toast but she didnt seem to understand this and kept asking which type of bread I wanted toasted  as apparently it was part of the cooked breakfast deal  She also didnt get the concept that we were all paying individually for our meals  Eventually and thankfully  we escaped her and got a table easily  There werent many people there   we had probably missed the breakfast rush  

Our two cooked breakfasts and porridge had been obtained already  but the pancakes had yet to be made and we were told they would be left to our table  Fifteen minutes passed and three of us had very nearly finished our food   still no pancakes  We stopped a guy who was clearing tables to ask about the pancakes  he went to enquire and told they would be left down ASAP  

A further 10 minutes passed  then Brunette shuffled out with pancakes in hand and gave them to another table  We heard the other customer state pancakes were not what she ordered  but shed take them anyway as shed been waiting so long  We were speechless  Brunette wandered off and we optimistically thought maybe our pancakes would be with us soon and had not just been given to another person   after all  we were provided with a numbered sign when we ordered the pancakes to identify our table  surely Brunette hadnt just completely missed/ ignored this   

But ten minutes later  still no pancakes  I went to the counter to complain   Blonde was there and apologised saying she was sorry there had indeed been a mix up and our pancakes were currently being made  Another 10 minute wait and they did eventually arrive  The wait had been appalling

R0154,Brought partner here on  St Patricks night there was no other diners other than a party in the function room  The food was very average and there was absolutely no atmosphere  Wouldnt make a return visit 
R0154,"Delicious food and absolutely amazing service and place 
Congratulations 
Everything was really perfectly 
Tks a million"
R0154,Delicious food and excellent  professional  discreet service 
R0154,Disappointing dining experience  The service was rushed almost to the point of being rude  and inattentive to our table  Our primary server seemed extremely bored and eager to get our ordering over with  The food was acceptable  but nothing special  Dessert in particular was mediocre at best  We had many excellent dining experiences in Dublin  but unfortunately this was not one of them  despite being one of the pricier meals  Considering how much we paid for the sub par service and the not exceptional food I would definitely not recommend it to anyone 
R0154,"Excellent food  nice wine list 
Sadly the waiter knocked full wine glass over 
Accidents happen but no acknowledgement of the fact that suit trousers were  hit with wine and on highlighting that wine hit the tie also  the waiters remark was �at least the tie was red
No offer of cloths   no offer of dry cleaning payment 
Manager was non plussed and stayed in the distance 
So great food   real shame about the service 
Had clients with me  have used the restaurant a lot 
Very disappointing "
R0154,Excellent food  terrific service and incredibly reasonable 
R0154,Fabulous coffee and cute little shop  A staple when I visit Dublin for work and very convenient as it is on my walk into the office 
R0154,Fabulous evening for a special family occasion 
R0154,Fantastic food and excellent service  wornderful atmosphere 
R0154,Fantastic meal and excellent service    Thank you so much for everything    We really felt spoiled leaving 
R0154,Fantastic restaurant  Our first time there but well be returning and recommending this amazing place    
R0154,"Food is good and the early bird menu is good value 
The atmosphere is cozy  decoration is quite nice 
All in all  its a good experience   "
R0154,Food just ok   definitely not the quality you would expect for the prices charged 
R0154,"Food was good bar a steak that wasnt cooked as ordered  Was advised that they dont cook to that cuissance and I should have been told beforehand  I was advised that  not apologized to 

Service was excellent bar one person who we felt was self important and sneering 

As a package  it wouldnt tempt me back Im afraid "
R0154,Great little place serving up tasty  fresh food  We tried the Po Ga and yellow curry followed by a viet  coffee 
R0154,Great little spot  food was top class with great presentation and staff were very attentive  Will be going again 
R0154,Great lunch here on Tuesday with friends  A very warm welcome from John and his staff  My scallops were excellent as were all our meals Well done to chef  
R0154,Great value  Had the 3 course and bottle of wine for 2 for  Euro 76 deal  Food was fab  Decor really nice 
R0154,I heard a lot about this place because it is always listed on food guides as one of the best places to have chicken wings  So I wanted to try it  Problem: they do not take reservations  So you just go and give it try  I did it  Bad idea  The place was packed and if I wanted a table I wouldnt need to wait at least 35 min  No way  Thats not free food  So I went to another place with my friends  
R0154,"I normally avoid places on OConnell Street coz they are never great but was in town with a friend and we had noticed a Groupon deal for here so said why not  burger fries and a beer for ten bob 

When we walked it didnt do anything to change my mind about why I avoid these places  The decor is      horrible  cheap tables and chairs  marks all over the walls from the chairs  some weird mural on the wall of fairies or pixies or something  Along the bar area tacky stickers  tacky bunting  random paintings  �the place is a mess and dirty and dingy looking but we had already paid for the food which was the only reason we stayed  

In fairness the food was good  big portions  tender beef patties  I went for the double which has bacon an egg  I had a runny yoke and crispy bacon  My friend went for one with onion and mushroom and was also very happy  �The waitress was very present and efficient  �I dont think theres much else to day about the food  �its a burger and chip  Ive had better and Ive had worse  

One thing which was a killer was the music  �the volume was too loud and they played one Adele song  Just one  the same song but different variations of it over and over and over and over we had the original  covers  covers of covers  instrumental  dance     the list goes on    it drove us crazy  

I dont think Ill be back  it was busy for that time of day and looked like it was fully booked for later  Seems lile they are just taking advantage of the location and Im sure prey mostly on unsuspecting tourists who will never give repeat business  The food is good so it has potential but the place is just dirty looking and messy "
R0154,"I expected much much better  The normal size burger is very very small for the price   6 95e   I had the classic chicken one and look at the pic  I had 3 miserable tiny piece of chicken  and overcook by the way  My friend had another chicken burger  still overcook 
Ok the food is below than average and what about the service   The waitress literally throws to us our the table water and wasnt very nice to us; when she saw that I was writing my review she came back and ask "" everything is all right  ""  Sorry but too late "
R0154,Unreal �and condescending to say the least 
R0154,"I visited restaurant in November 2017  Overall menu looked great and we were very excited  especially when weve heard that the restaurant received the Michelin Guide  
Ive had scallops to start  Im not an expert in cooking scallops but the scallops smelled like a sea water way to strong and tasted very fishy  Venison was my second course  it was dry despite being cooked medium  parsnip on my plate was dry and cold  Sides: baby potatoes that were raw on the middle and roasted carrots that supposed to be caramelised but tasted like they were just dipped in sugar water  

My colleagues had goats cheese for their starters there was way too much goats cheese and not enough beetroot or salad to go with it  For the main course they all had turkey  it was nicely cooked but unfortunately the sides werent nice  as per above  "
R0154,"I was expecting more  On first glance  it fresh  shiny and espouses an ethos that almost instantly makes you healthier however  my lunch box has left me wanting �

I went with the Middle Eastern chicken box with a base of leafy greens and spinach with a minty herby seasoning  The chicken was more roasted thigh than Middle Eastern   I was looking forward to deliciously spiced pulled chicken  Tiny portion of feta but tasty roasted peppers  The accompanying sauce was very oily  Very few leaves considering the base I ordered  leaves are not expensive   Next to no taste of mint from the sprinkled seasoning �

Perhaps I ordered wrong    keen to try out the miso salmon and pulled pork options but wont be racing back "
R0154,Ive got the wings a few times  each time Ive been very disappointed  fried for so long that the actual chicken inside the wings is dry and crispy then smothered in sauce to mask it instead of being succulent  tender and a whole wing   Head to somewhere else 
R0154,Lovely ambiance  and  warm welcome but food very disappointing 
R0154,Lovely atmosphere  great cocktails  nice car area  Fish was nice but cold sides and starters and desserts were poor 
R0154,"New Years Eve so you normally allow for some deviation but this was a shipwreck 

We waited just inside the door for the front of house guy to return to his station  5 min later he returns grumpy and then seats the couple who walked in just moments ago 

Finally seated in cramped conditions  �Wine list is poor in my opinion so we opt for some prosecco and a bottle of red "
R0154,"Nice  pleasant restaurant  
Went there for lunch   no lunch menu   only a la carte  
Service was good and the food was fine "
R0154,"One day  I had a craving for some sushi 
The food is great  Proper sushi  Pretty damn cheap too  They give you the cutest little soy sauce bottles too  I couldnt recommend it more"
R0154,One of the best meals I have had in Dublin  Beautifully cooked  lovely flavors  Excellent service  Relaxed atmosphere  I will definitely be back 
R0154,"Outstanding food and excellent service 
A bit expensive especially the wines but this is not unusual for Dublin 

We will certainly return "
R0154,Outstanding restaurant 
R0154,"Overall my wife  and  I were extremely disappointed with over recent visit  

The dining room was full cigarette smoke as the party goers in the function area were walking through the dining room to use a covered smoking area   each time the door opened smoke enterened the dining room  The �ambiance� was non existent due to this constant disturbance  the restaurant only appeared to be concern with the large party present for a 25th birthday

The starters were very nice  beef for mains was very average  I had an Irish coffee after dinner which was lukewarm but decided not to mention it as I just wanted to leave 

Terrible experience  Will not be returning"
R0154,Really delicious Thai food  the Massaman curry is so tasty  Would highly recommend this restaurant 
R0154,Rude host  Food smelled delicious but he told me he could not accommodate a party of one the entire night  this was at 7pm   I would not go back  I would not recommend this place
R0154,Service was slow but the staff are friendly  The fries were luke warm  and its unreasonably priced 
R0154,Several items on several dishes were burned  Quality of the food was poor  especially given the price 
R0154,This place has potential  nice surroundings and attentive staff but the food lets it down  5 of the 6 of us was dissatisfied with our main courses   we sent back two of the dishes and still the fish was not cooked properly   overall a very poor dining experience  staff became less attentive once the food was sent back  we wont be back 
R0154,Surprised and disappointed by the service as I had previously been impressed  On the basis of my last experience booked an extremely important lunch there   two mains orders were incorrect  staff were indignant  the situation became very awkward and no matter how nice the food afterwards  the experience left a sour taste  Will not be bringing important guests again 
R0154,Thanks to my sister we make an excellent stop here  3 hours later we were full of music and beer Make the stop  
R0154,The chicken and chips and the donner kebap are very good  I wouldnt buy the fish and chips again as that tasted like a large amount of grease  The prices are about right 
R0154,"The experience was so bad that we left very disappointed  Starters were ok but mains of lamb  recommended by waiter  were awful to the point of being mostly inedible  "" Loin of lamb with slow cooked belly"" was tough  sinewy and the belly was just fatty flaps not usually served in restaurants  We pointed out all the uneaten food to the waiter and the manager took our mains off the bill and apologised  We left without trying anything else  
The place is tired looking and seems to be surviving on past reputation "
R0154,The food and service were excellent and the terrace was really stylish and comfortable 
R0154,The food was awful  I had to send it back  The place itself is nice but the food leaves it down  I definitely wont be returning
R0154,The food was nice and the service is excellent but the portions are tiny and the lunch menu is very short  I wouldnt be going back in a hurry 
R0154,The lunch sandwhich menu that was available online was not offered when I sat down and I had to ask for it  a waiter delivered the bar menu and said this was a once off  however when we were leaving i saw a large group of people eating the burger we had eaten so clearly this ws not an exception  I ordered burgers for my sister and I  the presentation of this lunch was awful  thrown together  the food itself was alrite but presentation awful  would definitely not recommend anyone to go here  do not offer Bar Food if you are going to give little attention or thought to it  this is a shame because the restaurant itself is lovely 
R0154,The starter  was gone off and part of the main which included the same squid was also bad
R0154,They had the best Tuna Salad Ive ever had  The wrap was delicious and the cheddar cheese was the perfect touch 
R0154,They were fab  beautiful food and there was two guys playing guitar in the background which made a great atmosphere  They were excellent 
R0154,This is a wonderful find  Quiet with a guitar duo playing unobtrusively in the corner  Great food   Friday evening supper club is a fantastic deal  Highly recommended
R0154,Unfortunately we didnt have as a good an experience as we had hoped  The menu is quite limited and sorry to say the service was good in terms of speed but not great in terms of friendliness from the restaurant  The bar service was excellent 
R0154,"Very disappointing
Mains: Steak had no flavour / Chicken very ordinary   Supervalu does a better takeaway
Starters  Desserts  and  Coffees good
Music and general ambience excellent 
Service very good"
R0154,"Was very much looking forward to our evening  10 of us ate there on Saturday and we all felt it fell very short of our expectations  
None of us would be rushing back "
R0154,We started our meal with pork belly or scallops across most of the table and although small portions at  Euro 10  Euro 12 it was tasty  The mains were lovely too but tiny portions meant that side orders are necessary  This basically means that your tiny portion of fish at  Euro 27 needed at least one side  all sides are  Euro 4   The waiters poured our wine every 3 to 5 minutes which is a real pet hate of mine  and even after he was requested to just leave the bottle for us to pour  he did so again  The cheese plate at  Euro 14 is an absolute joke  Not only was it TINY  it had a very poor selection  I think a blue cheese of some sort is essential on a cheese plate   The restaurant itself is gorgeous  really warm and cosy and the terrace is absolutely fabulous  however  of our party I dont think any of us would be running back as it was a very expensive meal and quite honesly  very bad value for money 
R0154,"We went with friends to the restaurant on Friday night  we were celebrating our friend bday  The restaurant has great interiors and the garden is lovely 

Unfortunately the food was not great  I ordered Lobster menu and to be honest I was so disappointed  The soup was sour   I left more then half   and then I ordered lobster linguine and the sauce was tasted like soup and on top of it       it was spaghetti not linguine pasta     unfortunately I needed to send it back  Everything was over priced  for the linguine they charge 30 Euro  and really is not worth the money  

just to say the waitress was amazing  overall I would maybe go there for a coffee or glass of wine but not for dinner "
R0154,Went here with 2 friends and was impressed with the decor and restaurant  Started thinking it would be a great venue for our office Christmas Party   Very few people in the restaurant for a Friday night which is a worry  I dont like over the top service but the service here was good but no engagement from the staff  Very limited menu for someone who is vegetarian   Didnt get a buzz at all in the restaurant   Food was not great  After spending  Euro 220 we should have had a better night  Will not be booking for Christmas 
R0154,Wonderful Lunch
R0154,Would not recommend I really dont like writing negative reviews but I have gone here a few times and every time its been two hours to get the food one time being over two hours and still had to pay for the food that was also cold This time Ive ordered food and it has been 2 and half hours Ive already paid by card and theyre not answering the phone This has happened every single time Ive ordered food here and this will be the last time 
R0155,"Amazing Sushi  

Have returned twice since our first visit

Service also great"
R0155,Been here quite a few things and never disappointed also the value for money is ridiculous  Lunch time deals is a starter and a main for  Euro 10  You really cant go wrong and there is a great selection  The goats cheese croquettes were gorgeous  yum yum
R0155,Genuinely the best kebab in Dublin  The wraps are baked when you order  Good selection of sweets for dessert also
R0155,Great food and an upscale place to meet  After work place to meet friends  unwind and have a good meal at a reasonable price  Comfortable but it gets a bit loud in these close quarters  Great service 
R0155,Id give this place 5 stars for atmosphere  despite the way too loud music  and prices  1 for service  and 3 or 4 for food  �The bartender was friendly  but the waitresses were absolutely terrible   our waitress didnt speak to us for about 45 minutes after dropping off the food  and I dont think she even tried to smile  �She seemed more annoyed with us for being there  �We had to ask the other waitress to bring the check  but she apparently forgot  �We almost left cash on the table and walked out  �
R0155,It is a very nice place to eat at  the staff was really nice and does everything to fit the customers needs  Would surely recommend 
R0155,It was gross the rice was sticky and we got green tea and that was very dirty
R0155,Rude staff and double charged a group of us for drinks
R0155,The services were great and every dishes we ordered were delicious 
R0155,We had pizza  5  it was so good  best pizza i have ever tasted  My non vegetarian friends said the same thing and I think that means a lot  right
R0156,Loved our main dishes  
R0156,"�Theres something a bit depressing about a restaurant with so many empty seats and too many staff  yet no one actually able to serve the table properly 

And then theres the food  A dry  dry quesadilla with no sauce and a thick  did I mention dry  tortilla  filled with eh    dry chicken  �Guacamole that was ordered on the side was given back   tasteless  mashed to a smooth pulp  and generally a bit bleaugh 

All in all  whats happened  You used to be so with it  Then they changed what with it was   "
R0156, Warmly greeted and menu well explained  Despite table being pre booked we were seated at counter  not conducive to a romantic night out   Things went downhill from there and although the food was delicious the atmosphere was not only unromantic but downright stressful  Orders were being shouted continuously right beside us and we were spectators as stressed out staff were being put down and humiliated  Saki and cloakroom ticket accidentally removed with dishes between courses  Asked for a little breather before dessert and it was served straight away and taken away again    After spending 140 euro we left restaurant with a headache and went elsewhere for a cup of tea  Disappointing 
R0156,A truly wonderful experience    we will be back  
R0156,After wolfing down my new vegetarian lasagne to get to the cinema in time  I went over to pay  I really would have appreciated a tokenistic leaving a coke off the bill or something  I got nothing  but whatever  I decided to bring up the issue with the lady at the till  she had taken over our table after the original server brought me the meat dish  and she seemed like she may have been a manager  but I cant be sure  
R0156,Amazing staff  even better food   Everything was perfect 
R0156,Best sushi in Ireland weve ever tasted  What a treat and great experience 
R0156,Wouldnt order again  and not sure its worth stopping by the restaurant because nothing really blew me away  Too many other places to try 
R0156,Crab maki rolls were just disgusting  everything else was just ok
R0156,Delicious food  Very fresh and different tastes  We had the taster menu and everything was perfect 
R0156,Delicious Irish breakfast and great chill atmosphere  And there are books to read too  Highly recommend walking to 
R0156,"Disappointing venue for private parties 
"
R0156,Enjoyed the food and experience overall   Was hoping for more of a sushi based meal  would know better next time   Beef sushi was strange   The main thing was that the wait staff was too directive  tried to tell us what to order and how much   Im sure she was trying to be helpful  but I have eaten out before   Also  the emphasis seemed to be too much on having a grill at the table  multiple changes of service  etc    I prefer more of a focus on the food  with the rest being understated 
R0156,Excedingly rude and passive aggressive supervising manager  who started evening on a very sour note  Wine wildly overpriced  but was at least fruity as was promised  Food had nice tastes and vision  but poorly executed  An overall very poor experience and I would be very reluctant to return  My previous visit was OK  but this time it was so bad that Im very unlikely to book again 
R0156,Extremely expensive for interesting but not particularly enjoyable food 
R0156,"Folks I am a great fan of Dylan  I am also a great fan of Japanese food  

The food was lovely and different  It was far too expensive for what we got  

The place was too noisy for us     a Saturday night  it was full and we were in a small area     we will not return if seated in that area "
R0156,Food took over an hour and a half to arrive  I ordered their vegetable Phad Thai  the vegetables are overcooked and the flavors are bland  Never again 
R0156,The staff were good  but not too concerned about the deep frying   Id prefer if it was pan fried or oven cooked  then dropped on the floor in front of me 
R0156,"Good food  good service  well designed restaurant 
A great menu with a lot of seafood that I love so much
Very fine wine list"
R0156,Great food and nice ambience  had a lovely meal and went downstairs for a cocktail at the bar  Was informed that we were unable to sit at bar as we had not reserved chairs  even though nobody was sitting down   This was after we spent a fair whack on three courses  and  wine upstairs  incredibly disappointing end to what was a lovely night
R0156,Great sushi  but the entrees were unimpressive   Ive had better shabu style hot pots for less than half the price 
R0156," I stated that this rule was not displayed anywhere on the menu or outside   He then said "" Leave so     "" Never in all my years have I been subjected to such rude treatment  �He was extremely rude and condescending   I urge you not to visit this establishment   Manners do not cost a penny"
R0156,I came here after reading the reviews online but I was utterly disappointed with service and the mediocre food  We ordered a pizza and a burger  The pizza was VERY Greasy and the burger was ok  The service by the waiter was horrible   He never never returned to the table and we waited over 30 minutes  The restaurant was not even half full  I couldnt figure out why he was so abominable or if something else was amiss  Overall  I would never come here again   NEVER 
R0156,"I have eaten here on two occasions once at the counter and once in a corner   The staff have been lovely  attentive and helpful with the menu  The main maitre d has a presence which I like  and a good sense of humor  However I find the seating tight  

I last dined here on Thursday 17th January and unfortunately our order was not taken correctly  which was fine in the end as we had plenty of food  but at the same time  not great  

However  our bigger problem was  your smoke alarm system went off above our heads  and kept going on and off until we could no longer listen to it  and left  "
R0156,I have recently returned from London where good/excellent restaurants are abundant  This restaurant is the epitome of awfulness  and sadly it is symbolic of Dublin cooking which is over priced and without flair  There is no culinary skill whatsoever   The food is confused in flavour and nationality  Truffle with sashimi  Will not return  Sorry but true 
R0156,"I went into this restaurant primarily to have a mezze platter  but because I was there by myself  they refused to serve me a mezze �platter for one   only the much higher priced platter for 2   or I had the option if paying about 4 times more to order several individual appetizers 
Moreover  the hostess tried to seat me in a spot where I wouldnt be seen  despite the fact that there were a number of other small tables more visible 

I guess there are all sorts of ways to discriminate "
R0156,"Id been to this restaurant before and was excited to return  I ordered a glass of wine but the wine had corked and there was cork residue in my glass and my wine glass was chipped which was very unpleasant when I took a sip   I sent this back but was waiting a long time for a replacement that I had to follow up on where it was  

My friend and I order the Sirloin on charcoal   my steak was not cooked very well  Usually I like my steak medium rare but it was close to well done when it arrived  I dont like to complain in restaurants and had already sent my wine back so I ate the food  

I would understand if the restaurant was really busy that these things can happen in these instances but we were the 2nd table in the restaurant so there should be no errors when the restaurant is quiet "
R0156,If they turned down the heating a bit so you dont melt into the cushions  Id give them one more star 
R0156,Its just ok  The coffee is fine but far from being one of the best you can have in Dublin  The croissant was ok  the carrot cake slice was kind of small and just ok  the place is ok    Nothing to recommend here  really 
R0156,My sister and i experienced sushi here for the time  have to say the food and servive was excellent  the only issue we had was when we got our bill there was 12 5 percent service charge where on the menu it says partys of six or more get charged this 12 5 percent 
R0156,Not a great experience all round  the staff we encountered were very nice but the food is not good  Chicken tempura was just awful  the sushi was tasteless   and the mains just a piece of meat   oh I was offered an eggcup full of kimchee cabbage to go with mine  eye roll  with ONE alcoholic drink bill came to  Euro 130  A total joke  Would never dine here again  We both woke up the next morning with pounding headaches so i can only assume massive levels of salt in all the food and yet still no flavour  There are much much better Japanese restaurants in Dublin 
R0156,"Not very good at all 

I dont think I would ever visit this place again  Im sure there are much better pizza places in Dublin "
R0156,Over priced when you realise that each item is charged by unit   Service was very slow even though not busy   Wine was continuously poured which is annoying    Main courses were very good    Starters disappointing    Was there 3 or 4 times before and was much better    Menu changed and now over priced
R0156,Over priced for the standard of the food  It was nice but nothing out of the ordinary  which is what youd expect at these prices 
R0156,Overpriced  menu has been changed and is not as good as it was
R0156,"Some of the food items are cleverly created bearing surprise and right balance of umami flavours  Unfortunately the set tasting menu which is usually a safe bet was a continuum of salty broths  Atmosphere was loud   too loud  hot   too hot and busy with people standing leaning on my chair and engaging loudly in conversations across our table  
Staff is friendly and knowledgeable   well oiled machine of a team  Unfortunately Not that clever and we wont return "
R0156,Sorry but lacking atmosphere  slightly over priced   service slow    not really the experience that we had been expecting
R0156,"Tables far too close together  even though the room they put us in at the top was not full  A waiter who would not leave us alone and listened in on our private conversation  then smugly told us we didnt need to order as he already knew what we were having  
Food tasted incredible but overpriced "
R0156,Taste is one of the best restaurant experiences Ive ever had   LOVED every plate    specially the OTORO nigiri   Worth every dime  
R0156,The food is nice but completely overpriced for what it is
R0156,The food is totally over priced and the quality does not match the price  We ordered two miso soups  a salad  some sushi and had one glass of wine  and  one sake  Our meal came to  Euro 150 which we felt was very expensive for the quality and quantity of food we received  We were in the restaurant for less than 1 hour as the food came out so fast  We left feeling hungry and unsatisfied  Definitely would not recommend this restaurant 
R0156,The nigiri sushi is delicious although expensive  but otherwise the food does not come close to its marketing hype  Some of the cocktails are very odd tasting mixtures and the sticky pork main course we had was very fatty 
R0156,"The venue is very nice and the staff are very attentive  However the food was exceptionally poor  I appreciate that on the menu it says ""we have played with temperatures   "" I would suggest that strategy be abandoned  Perhaps I am a philistine but the anaemic insipid prawns sashimi served luke warm were pretty dire  Likewise the monkfish  As I was dining with a friend whom I hadnt seen in a while I did not complain  

However in other circumstances I would have sent back four of the six dishes we got  

Finally  the price  Even if the quality was good  for what you get  and knowing the cost of fish  etc  And appreciating the overheads  it is grossly overpriced 

I have already recommended another friend NOT to go  Needless to say I will not be returning and would have reservations about dining in the ""stone"" part now  which I have never eaten in  
"
R0156,"This has been my choice for lunch several times over the past few months and every time I had to ask myself why havent I learned my lesson 

The place feels soulless and the quality of the burrito is mediocre  The ingredients are hardly mixed together and you have to remind them to be generous with the portion or you will end up with a very light little donkey 

There are many better choices to make both in terms of lunch alternatives in the area and burritos in Dublin "
R0156,"This menu is restrictive and extremely expensive   Euro 5 for one piece of nigiri that is one bite    The Dexter beef was tough  at  Euro 38 for 5 small slices  and the peppered chocolate dessert was so highly peppered as to be cough inducing 

There are lots of good restaurants in Dublin offering good food for value for money  This is unfortunately not one of them  It started a few years ago as an interesting experiment  It has now moved into the realm of an unpleasantly ecletic dining experiene at a price that makes your eyes water "
R0156,"This place is not what is used to be  It used to be our favorite restaurant but they have cut back on everything  The menu is very small and all the delicious interesting dishes are gone  Wagu beef pot my husband has had before was over cooked with very little in the pot  We both left hungry with no alcohol or soft drinks for  Euro 120
Gutted it will be the last time we will go"
R0156,"This restaurant is sold as a Japanese restaurant but in my opinion it is not a retaurant Japanese is a restaurant that mixes the styles 
The dishes are in general very scarce in the food and its relation quality price is very bad 
As for the service I think it was quite bad as I had booked a table and when I arrived there was no room available I had to be waiting more than 20 minutes and finally I had to sit at the bar because there were no tables available having previously booked  for me This is an awful service "
R0156,"This was my second time here  First time was great  But this time was not ideal  Im a vegetarian and explained thats  when I made the booking and when I arrived  ""No problem "" They said  
My husband and I did the 65 Euro  Tasting menu  The staff seemed to forget I was a vegetarian each time they brought a course out  My husband got double of everything and the kitchen would scramble to make me something   Every time my food was delayed or sometimes wouldnt appear at all  My husband got 2 3 extra courses than I did  yet we paid the same value  
The veggie options were so uninspired  My husband received a nice plate of sashimi and I got a salad     
 Im used to boring vegetarian food but nice sashimi costs money and it was pretty insulting to get a salad compared to the fish  Mind you  the salad also came out 10 minutes after my husbands sashimi 
There were other small details that showed a lack of experience such as when we ordered cocktails when we first arrived  15 minutes early  and they started bringing us our starters before the cocktails arrived  It wouldve been nice to enjoy a drink before all the food  we felt rushed  And the cocktails we ordered did not compliment the miso soup at all  A pretty gross pairing  
I would not return here or recommended this place again "
R0156,Too expensive for what they serve
R0156,Unfortunately we did not enjoy our meal  I ordered broccoli tempura and the coconut lime hot pot  The broccoli tempura was served with a very small portion of a spicy mayonnaise which promptly ran out  The coconut lime hot pot tasted like a hot sugary cocktail with raw vegetables in it  Also you have to cook it yourself  You throw the raw vegetables into the metal pot with the liquid already in it and sit and wait  The waiter said it would take a minute  Long after the minute had passed  I began eating the hot pot and the vegetables were still raw in the sugary tasting liquid  It was horrid 
R0156,"very disappointing  competely overpriced 
 Vegetarian main course was disgraceful  coconut milk and lime with a few veg thrown in  could make it at home in 10 mins and would cost less tha 5 euro 
Veg starter was also just a salad of pear and radish  absolutly no cooking skills required  menu was 65 a head before wine    shocking  we are complete suckers to put up with this stuff  
Fish main course  was raw in centre and inedible despite leaving it on the hot coals for ages 

Will not be back  shame "
R0156,"Waitress lovely and helpful  Atmosphere lovely  Drinks were very nice  

Food was very slow to come out  Starters came out every 10 mins or so  Over 30 mins by time all the starters came out  
The glazed pork for main had a nice flavour but very fatty and chewy  

Also v expensive for what it is  More expensive than London which has beautiful Japanese food   Better sushi in the take aways around Parnell Sq where the original Asian food houses are  Its a shame "
R0156,Was not impressed  Sushi was just ok  And the steak wasnt great for the price 
R0156,We didnt get to try many other places to eat because they couldnt open due to the weather   This place was no disaster either  Slow service  Bland food
R0156,We used online app to book the reservation and ended up here   The maitrd kept saying �how delicious� the food �upstairs� was without just saying it was Japanese   We went away feeling like we spent too much money 
R0156,"We used to eat here occasionally and the food was pretty good  in fact the burgers were excellent  I was craving a burger  so arranged to meet friends for dinner there  Big mistake  Its probably one of the worst meals weve ever had 

Bangers and mash   sausages were deep fried  Seriously 
Lasagna   There was no sauce in it  A layer of dry mince over vegetable  with some cheddar cheese on top  ALmost 14 euros for that beauty 
2 dry tastless burgers  that we had to cover in vinegary ketchup in order to eat 
The garlic mayo on the side tasted of     not sure  maybe fish  with a hint of dust  Still cant place the flavour 

We just decided to pay at the bar and leave  As I was leaving the table the server asked how it was  I said it was nothing like it used to be and I was disappointed because we used to eat there 

Sadly  Ill never ever go back there  Shame  it used to be so tasty "
R0156,Went here for a date and was pretty disappointed  The service was sloppy and inattentive  but friendly  Food portions were overpriced and very small  The food itself was ok  but it really didnt have any amazing flavours  and a few dishes  salmon carpaccio  were actually bad  In its defence  the ambience and style of the restaurant were lovely  but would never go again 
R0156,"When I heard of a bar in Dundrum town centre  I thought thats a great idea  Regretfully its more for show  Hard to get a seat  poor food menu  sitting in the dark and the bar staff are pretty rude  I noticed that theres some arrogant customers too in addition to the bar staff 

The nightclub upstairs is a room with a bar and to charge in is ironic given how bad it is  This place is only surviving due to being part of the centre "
R0157,A lovely cosy place where you can have wonderful breakfast and lunch  The staff is very friendly and the food is great  Its a must to visit 
R0157,Amazing food  great service and very conveniently located 
R0157,Delicious food  great service 
R0157,"Disappointing first  and ever visit   Found them on web  and I was expecting great service since they are located in a heavily touristy area  Wrong  I ordered Kokoro Tonkotsu Black  and Ebi Katsu  �After a minute wait  I flagged my server when I noticed the couple behind me got their order before I did  and I was there first  �The server then came up to me and said  ""are you ready to order ""   I said  ""you already took my order""  and I mustve said this too loud because the couple behind me said ""Ooopss ""  and laughed  So anyway  I gave her my order again  and waited another 20 minutes  

So I waited a total of 50 minutes for mediocre ramen  served with cold pork chashu :/   yea really disappointing  they gave me one piece of complimentary gyoza that was bland for my taste  �The saving grace was the Ebi Katsu  crunchy  flavorful  and sauce was great 

Unfortunately it wasnt a good experience for me  so  I do not plan on coming back 

The server apologized for forgetting to process my order  but she didnt really do enough to save my experience "
R0157,Had a Pad Thai chicken in there today  Beautiful as always and staff were super friendly aswell
R0157,"It is in a great location  Ive been twice and had the Chicken Liver Pat� to start on both occasions  The food is very good  and you wont be disappointed by the portion sizes  I would certainly return  particularly if going for a pre theatre meal  

"
R0157,Lovely people good food decor
R0157,"My fiance and I went  for our romantic Valentines meal  We enjoyed the atmosphere and the decor  I enjoyed the starter which was a scallop but the crispy bacon was very fatty  My fiance unfortunately did not enjoy it  

For main we got fillet steaks; we both did not enjoy it  It wasnt a good quality steak it was very chewy even though it was medium rare  The sauce with the steak wasnt pleasant; too many different flavours in one dish that didnt marry well together   We had two varieties of potatoes for side  and the chips were really salty  

For dessert my fiance had chocolate brownie and again he did not enjoy it as it had a bland taste and small portion  I had a selection of 3 desserts and it was a really small portion and it was just OK nothing exceptional  

Overall a night setting but not good value for money "
R0157,Nice staff  but food no better than an average takeaway  Also  theyve a big step at the front  even though I sepeified wheelchair access  Staff helped  but really  get a portable ramp  lads 
R0157,"Swap to Hebrew

Sweet potato soup was excellent 

The service is outstanding     always with a smile 
Fair prices "
R0157,Very good restaurant with amazing view  especially in a sunny day  Extremely courteous and attentive staff  Delicious food  loved breakfast of champions 
R0157,We enjoyed the late lunch we had here  �I personally loved the Guinness and steak pie  �My husband had the fish and chips  which were flavorful and not greasy 
R0157,We had to ask for everything  From initial ordering  to 2nd round of drinks to the check and then waited a very long time for the check  Workers were hovering all around us and yet no acknowledgement what so ever  unless we made an assertive effort 
R0157,We made a reservation about 30 minutes before hand on a busy Friday night  When arriving on time we were told the restaurant did not honor reservations made so close to reservation time  We were not even offered a wait time and were essentially dismissed  Beware of the reliability of this restaurant if visiting 
R0158, We booked a table for 6 45pm that evening midway through a Friday afternoon  Received a reservation confirmation email immediately but then received a telephone message at 6 25pm stated that this was not in fact a reservation but rather a request for a reservation and they couldnt accommodate us until much later in the evening  around 11pm   Very little use to two people wanting dinner in the next half hour and now walking restaurant to restaurant looking for somewhere to take us on a busy Dublin Friday evening  Extremely disappointing outcome and 20 minutes notice of the issue simply not good enough  Why bother using this site if you cant rely on the reservation 
R0158,"Always loved the food and experiences here until I came here one night as  voucher customer  Definitely saw a huge drop in the attentiveness of the staff and the overall quality of the food  

Apart from this have never had anything but positive experiences but havent been back since that night  

Sent an email to the manager but never received any sort of reply "
R0158,Amazing this place   music and food the best
R0158,Ambience is great  good cocktails   Service was very slow   took a long time to order drinks and food   Then after 2 hours the waitress asked us to leave as the table was required for another reservation  this was fine as its on the reservation notice but she hadnt even brought the bill  At 9pm a blues guitarist started playing but he was extremely loud   we couldnt hear each other at this point  Food was reasonable value for money 
R0158,Bread served cold  starter presentation unfinished  
R0158,cocktails are better at other places  The secret door was cool   but the food was just piazza and stuff and the cocktails were just OK
R0158,"Decent food  good price  free wifi 
Panini and a small coke for  Euro 7 50  Not bad  if you ask me "
R0158,"Fantastic find 
Had a lovely evening and great food 
The staff where very friendly 
Loved it"
R0158,Food very average    service excellent    ambiance cosy    
R0158,Food was very oily and service was very poor  had to ask for drinks  ask to order and ask for the bill 
R0158,Great food and great cocktails 
R0158,Great place for a quirky night out  loved the whole idea of how it is set up  food was excellent  service excellent  would definitely recommend 
R0158,"Having made my booking on January 16th for Saturday February 3rd at 6 30pm  I received a call from the restaurant 5 hours prior to our reservation to state the table wasnt available but they had an one for 5pm  Reluctantly  I agreed to the changed time  
Upon arrival I enjoyed the quirky entrance  a very nice staff member took our order for drinks and main course  Both of which were satisfactory  We ordered desert and as my friend was still finishing when a make staff member asked ""were you not told we needed the table back at 6 30pm""  My friend asked for extra cream to finish her desert and it was delivered to the table  We now knew we had overstayed our welcome  I was unable to reply as I thought this was a absurd  1 and a half hours for what had been relaxing and enjoyable became quite the opposite  We finished paid and left  Would not recommend  my impression is the business model is turn over tables quickly for highest return  Very disappointed "
R0158,I am came with a party of 4 and we enjoyed our time  I ordered the pumpkin tortellini it was so yummy glad I got it would definitely eat here again 
R0158,I had a thoroughly enjoying dining experience atpand I will be sure to recommend and come back   Thank you for a great evening 
R0158,I had the worst onion rings ever  the tap water tasted like plastic and a bad milkshake  All served by an unprofessional waitress 
R0158,I must say I did not enjoy my visit to this place and will not be returning or recommending this place to friends or family  Firstly our booking was at 8 30 and we finally got seated at 8 55  Then when we said we were not having food we were asked to leave the table and return to be seated at the bar  We were given a drink on the house for this but we would have rathered stay at the table but felt we didnt have much choice  We both found the waiter extremely rude  He let us order at 22 55 and then said he couldnt serve us as our time was up and he needed the seats  He then walked away without any further explanation  I will not be returning and wont be recommending this place at all
R0158,"Just a normal restaurant in a basement   I was expecting some secrecy and challenge to locate the place   nope  none of that  The ""secret"" door is open more than it is closed  Was hoping for a bit of intrigue and excitement  I thought that was the whole idea     was really disappointed  wouldnt return or recommend "
R0158,Loved our evening at the restaurant  From the moment we booked and got the secret code to get in to the underground speakeasy  through to the food and cocktails we loved all of it  Staff were really knowledgable and friendly  the musician that was in was perfect for the atmosphere  the food was delicious and the cocktails were potent  Highly recommend 
R0158,"My husband and I had been looking forward to this unique dining experience since before our trip to Ireland   I made a reservation  got the info and we were both very excited 
When we arrived  we checked in and were seated pretty quickly  It went downhill after that  the service was bad  We had to go to the bartender to get our order taken  the waitress completely ignored us while being quite attentive to the tables around us  The food was good and the drinks were great and we had a nice evening together but for a pricey meal  you expect better service  Now  I dont like to be bombarded and it is a dark  kind of intimate space  but the service was non existent   Honestly  we probably could have walked out without paying the tab and no one would have noticed  To pay our bill we went to the bar  and stood there until the hostess noticed that we were waiting with coats on "
R0158,Not impressed with this restraunt  Food isnt too bad but the restraunt itself is an uncomfortable environment  
R0158,Overpriced and too loud
R0158,overpriced for average fare; lack of wine selection also not great and no value at all on the wine
R0158,Poor quality of food and very limited winelist  Not comfotable either i get what rheyre trying to do but very disappointed 
R0158,"Seriously I dont understand the hype about this place  Busy  very   noisy and they dont have enough menus  Well  maybe I just had a bad experience  but I wouldnt go back  

"
R0158,"The atmosphere was good on the nights we were here  Cocktails are very good   especially the Bon Bon and the food very good too  But beware  like a lot of places the servers seem to lose interest once the mains are delivered so if you are leisurely enjoying your drink and contemplating a nightcap cocktail or a sweet treat to round off the night you might not get a chance to have one because you will only be given around 2   2 5 hours at your table and no more   seemingly  whether there is another reservation or not  On two occasions we were told fairly unceremoniously that we had to vacate our table with no real notice cutting off the possibility of dessert on both evenings  

I have no problem paying what are fairly high prices for a great meal in a great place   but unfortunately I cant rave about this place because the two evenings ended in a way that left rather a bitter taste in the mouth  Not sure I will be back "
R0158,"The eggs benedict was delicious  It comes with a lot if hollandaise sauce  

Their coffees are also good  My Americano was strong and smooth "
R0158,The place was a huge disappointment   The food comes from other restaurant upstairs where Im pretty sure you can get the same food for a better price   The cocktail menu is seriously lacking and the staff give you an attitude for ordering something thats listed ON THE MENU     The prices are outrageous for the quality   If the only attraction is how the location is kept secret until you book  save your money   You just go down the stairs  and press a little sign hanging on the wall on the left and the door disguised as a cabinet opens   After that  everything else about the place is absolutely disappointing 
R0158,The story about the place was true  it really is a secret place even a policeman standing outside the restaurant  we asked about the place didnt knew about it  The place was cool  Our reserved table was in the end under the speaker  so our romantic evening went without hearing each other and the only thing we was thinking about was how to get rid of the singer  It was to loud    The food was unfortunately very average 
R0158,"This is a speakeasy that is a secret  The clue comes as to the location when you make a reservation  Unfortunately it does not work for app  We ended up finding the place after a lot of trial and error  Walked in the back door to be informed the kitchen was closed  

App you should take this off the list  Looks fun but needs to be organized "
R0158,This place is AMAZING   If youre ever in Ireland  make it a point to visit and ask a for Andrew  Hes an amazing bartender
R0158,Unfortunately we had a very bad experience here at House   We arrived for lunch at 12 15pm  we hadnt booked a table but there was one available right beside the outdoor area   So it was quite cold due to the door being open non stop   We were given the menus including the house specials of the day   My sister ordered the chicken  and  chorizo salad with the dressing on the side   I ordered the mushroom risotto   My sisters ordered arrived and to say it was disappointing was an understatement   It basically was a whole load of rocket leaves with a breast of chicken and the dressing on the side   My course arrived and they handed me spaghetti Bolognese   I politely told them that I hadnt ordered this I had ordered the risotto   So the lovely waitress took it back   5 minutes later another waiter came over to say they had given me the wrong menu and they only have pea risotto available   That was perfect with me  10 minutes later my food arrived  while my sister had finished hers   My risotto was a disaster  basically a load of sticky rice and a few peas with Parmesan   Definitely one of the most unappetising meals I have ever had   Our plates were removed and we ordered coffee   After ten minutes of waiting our coffee never arrived so we went up to the bar to check to see if they were coming   Once again our order had been forgotten about   We decided to get the bill   another lovely gentleman came over with the bill and apologised about the coffee and asked if my sister would like a free take away as she was going to work   She gladly accepted  and he said he would just check to see if they had the proper take out cups for her   So once again he disappeared and never came back   We could see him serving other people so we just decided to pay our bill and leave as we had waited long enough   Very disappointed with the food and would definitely not head back for food/lunch   Would still go for a drink though as its a good spot 
R0158,Very average   basically a basement  Sharing salt and pepper and 1 bowl of Parmesan between tables 
R0158,Very impressive  love the hidden location and the service we received
R0158,We visited a while ago  They dont accept credit/debit cards which was very embarrassing  The waiter was rude and dismissive and the food was the most terrible thing Ive eaten in my life  The only good thing was the fact that it was hidden away and that the waiter would walk us from grafton street to the venue 
R0158,we were a group of six girls the bling pic is fantastic and i would recomdend it to everyone  Great food perfect and frindly servic awdome drinks  There was live music
R0158,Wonderful pre theatre meal and cocktails  We had main courses  deserts  and cocktails  All yummy and a wonderful ambiance 
R0159,Excelente services
R0159,Great pub food and music hidden away  Mostly locals with a few tables reserved for those who want food 
R0159,The place  food  staff and house wine where amazing  I will definitely go back  Best place Ive been recently 
R0160,Amazing food and friendly staff  The vegetarian options were great  I would love to come back next time we visit Dublin 
R0160,"Charming staff and excellent food   a bit pricey but worth it for a special
Occasion"
R0160,Despite making a booking   we were told on arrival we only had a �drinks reservation which wasnt the case  Very little done in an effort to correct the situation and resulted in us leaving as we had no other option 
R0160,"Excellent cocktails and food  Asian fusion cuisines are very creative and very delicious  
Strongly recommend the ice cream sandwich and the mayo with crisps  Cocktails are full of surprises  You never know how to combine wasabi into a cocktail until you try yhis place 
Recommend to all the foodies "
R0160,Great cocktails  not too expensive  Lovely decor  music not too loud so great for a catch up 
R0160,Great coffee  �One of the best in Dublin  Friendly staff and nice premises  �Definitely would recommend the filter coffee 
R0160,I really like this place esp its deal of  Euro 10 for any burger meal  I always have it in mind whenever I am hungry when I am in town as its value for money   I find the staff really welcoming and friendly  I would strongly advise this place to anyone as it is my go to place 
R0160,The food  and  service here is amazing  best Indian food in Dublin  Lovely atmosphere  No matter what u choose you wont be disappointed  A must visit 
R0160,The food was lovely  Falafels and hummus were fresh and yum  The sauces were nice as well �
R0160,This coffee shop is excellent value  They do a great breakfast very cheap  Lunches are very good with a wide variety of foods from sandwiches to hot food like chips and curry  The food is delicious at any time of the day  The staff are extremely friendly and always helpful and management are always friendly and welcoming  The place is comfortable and relaxed  as they have thought of the little things that count  like cushions on the chairs and nice decorations  They also do food to take away  There is free parking right outside the door which is convenient  Its a regular haunt of Bertie Ahern  I would recommend this coffee shop to anyone whether its just for a quick cuppa or to meet and catch up with friends  Top notch place 
R0160,"Took a takeaway out of impulse on the way home  wish I hadnt  Bland food with no flavor  Have not had Thai food for a while because of the bad experience here  

Its cheap food but I wouldnt recommend it unless you just want food to fill your stomach "
R0160,Visited here recently with work colleagues for lunch  I would be a bit of a fussy eater which I know is not ideal  They had pre made sandwiches and when I asked for one with no cheese as I dont like it I was told they could not facilitate and make one up  As I was with work colleagues who had ordered their lunch already I ended up having a scone  Which I had to pay for and then go to a different section to pick out myself and then a different area to get butter/jam etc  The staff member I dealt with wasnt overly pleasant about it either  Dont think I will be visiting here again 
R0160,Was amazing food definitely recommend here  the service was very good and the tasting menu was really good
R0160,"We were actually offer to move to the restaurant if we would like to have move food than just drink which we think it was a good idea as it was a girl night out and we havent met for quite a while 
However issue we had was �the waiter� they were quite rude and rush  They made us feel like we were cheap he instead  of offered us like chef special or signature dishes  they were hardcore selling only most expensive dishes on the menu we found that really uncomfortable

The gentleman who served us ask if we would like still or sparkling water  One of my friend said �Tap water please� for about 3 times but he completely ignored her  So we had to order still water because we thought they might not serve tap water here but found out later they do have tap water in bottles in the fridge just behind our table 

After we finished our meal we ask for bill and it was almost 500 between 8 of us which was reasonable for dinner at fine dining restaurant  But we took quite some time to split the bill as some of us ordered some thing more expensive than others  some just had water  and some had cocktails 

A few of us paying in card and some pay in cash but we did not get the change back  It was a small amount of money but since we paid 12 5 percent service charge  the change should be given without enquiring about it  And if we want to tip more for the service shouldnt that be our decision

Unfortunately we wont be returning "
R0161,good pizza  fast service  good prices  nice setting  no queues at lunchtime on Sat  overall good experience 
R0161,I waited for half an hour  and nobody even said hello  let alone took my order  Abysmal service
R0161,It was such a good night when we first try this restaurant in July  Excellent service  charming room  very good food  For sure  we will come back 
R0161,Over price and over charged  Food was nice and atmosphere  Nice interior 
R0161,Very good food   great value and efficient friendly service
R0162,A favorite of ours  never fails to deliver
R0162,Amazing  Claire our server was spot on  and in fact all the staff was great  Good quaint mellow vibe away from the mayhem of the city 
R0162,Best in town for private business lunch / dinner  Quiet and customer friendly in every way 
R0162,Booked on behalf of Executives from a key Irish company and their guest   feedback was that it was all great  good and friendly service without being intrusive 
R0162,Culture Night  We went to see a band playing but the bar was very crowded and hot  Staff were friendly   good service  Good was tasty but slightly cold  A busy evening to visit 
R0162,Delicious food and great service
R0162,Disappointing overall experience  I realize were not in Italy but the service and food was not great for the price and type of dining experience offered 
R0162,"Dublin is consistently a let down when it comes to sushi/Japanese food  Usually I find rolls badly constructed or sashimi overpriced or tempura heavy etc 

This place is a pretty good effort and we had a nice meal there  I found the food to be clean and delicate as it should be  I had a soft shell crab roll which at 14 euro was a little expensive  I also had the sashimi mix plate which was delicious and as it should be  10 euro   again not as cheap as reviews I had read about  I had a few pieces if sushi and the eel was my favourite  Generally the sushi was between 2 to 3euro a piece  Which is ok  but not cheap like reports I had heard 
The service was ok  Waitress forgot part of our order but was friendly  �One thing I didnt like was we ordered starters but the food just started coming out as they made it  Westerners like more structure to the serving of a Japanese meal and to bring edamame beans at the end of the meal �along with miso soup which was ordered as a starter was a bit annoying  When we orders our food we had the sashimi brought to us as a started and although it was nice it was not what we expected  It was like the main event was first 
All in all it was a nice meal washed down with a couple of Japanese beers  
Im glad they are hear and will go back again "
R0162,Excellent as always  Our 8 year old loved the place so much that he filled in the review card  Introduced to real quality at a very young age 
R0162,Food a little disappointing compared to previous visits 
R0162,Food was okay but the menu was quite old fashioned  Not much on offer for vegetarians  Attentive waiters  My main course was a salad and they brought the wrong one  which was basically mounds and mounds of spinach leaves  Must try harder 
R0162,Food was very slow and poor quality when it arrived   we were barely finished our mains when we were told our table was needed  never even got dessert
R0162,Food  atmosphere and service were all top of the pops
R0162,For 34e the steak was very grizzly  and the chips were fairly standard  The pepper sauce was amazing though and the presentation was nice  Service was pretty slow  despite the place being almost empty  and two glass of wine took about 20mins to arrive 
R0162,Friendly staff and nice food  Nice patio area if you want to sit outside  Would recommend the beef burger  Never disappoints 
R0162,Great food and service and close to government buildings
R0162,GREAT FOOD AND SERVICE IN A LOVELY PLACE TO TALK  THE SEAFOOD TOWER IMPRESSED MY GUESTS AND IT DID ME 
R0162,Had breakfast sandwich and a latte  Both perfect  Seriously 
R0162,It was a great atmosphere with great food and service 
R0162,It was average  Would not return
R0162,Loved loved loved our dinner  It was the perfect way to kick off the Christmas season  The staff were so friendly and the setting of the restaurant is so beautiful  Would highly recommend
R0162,Lovely food and gave us a closed off area for our catch ups  Will be back again 
R0162,Lovely venue for a drink but food was poor  Terrine was just out if fridge and v cold  Two of us had the rib eye steaks which were the meanest thinnest Ive ever had which at  Euro 34 represented very poor value for money  To top everything off we were presented the bill without asking for it   So poor overall sadly 
R0162,Maitre Di is particularly warm and welcoming  All the staff are very well trained  Its always a pleasure to eat there
R0162,Meh   beautiful rooms  good but not great food  service no where near what one expects at that price point 
R0162,Meh  Lot of attitude with the so so food  But the Thursday night music was good 
R0162,Open beef sandwich is bad value  Fish cakes poor  Burger best value  Service slow  Girls pleasant  Not good if you have 1hour for lunch
R0162,Super cute breakfast/lunch space that overlooks the courtyard  �Dishware was unique and fun and latte was excellent 
R0162,"my first few bites was just the meat    and all the rice was down the bottom    and a load of tomatos placed in the middle    nothing was mixed in    my boyfriend got the chicken burrito and his was the same    dry    so dry and meat on one side   rice shoved and hidden down the other    We didnt finish them anyway   
Tables werent cleared up after customers   Not straight away anyway     you wouldnt care if the staff were busy    but lets just say if the staff have time to be talking to each other chit chatting behind the counter then they would have time to clear the tables    As harsh as that sounds    Or even once they see a customer sit down they could clean them instead of having customers do it themselves    They werent helpful with the order either    They couldnt take it quick enough Lets say    "
R0162,The pepper pot cafe has very pleasant staff and tasty food  We enjoyed our meal very much  
R0162,"The restaurant is lovely inside  Our waiter was very attentive and prompt  We got buy one cocktail get one free when we checked in on Yelp  

The food was fairly good  I ordered the chicken soup it was a little too salty for my taste  Their bread was very good served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar  My husband ordered the pasta arribiatta And it was not spicy enough for him  

I would like to go back and try something else on their menu  They have several good options

Wow  tried them a second time  Antipasto excellent  pizza perfect thin crust  lasagna very good "
R0162,The staff member who served my table did not know or understand the menu   My guests had the fishcakes in a nice sauce  but no veg   I had the haddock which was well cooked  but the mash was cold and tasteless   The coffee machine was broken so we were served  albeit on the house  not so warm coffee   The bill for three people was  Euro 141 00 and it did not value for money or good food 
R0162,The worst Thai food ever     We ordered appetizers which were so stale and bad tasting that we paid for our alcohol and left  Please dont go there  
R0162,"This is a purely takeaway/delivery place  so theres no seating provided  I was feeling peckish and decided to drop by and get some soup and a starter as a snack  

I got the Chicken Sweetcorn Soup and it was more sugary than your average dessert  no kidding   There was barely any corn or chicken in it which is just sad  I also ordered Vegetable Spring Rolls and they were ok  but nothing to write home about  

Id probably avoid this place again unless there are no other options "
R0162,Total perfection as always 
R0162,Unfortunately the service was not what it should be in a five star hotel although this is the bar area  We were not offered more water when the glasses were empty and we had a delay in getting our coffee order  The biggest complaint we had was that it was cold and our guest are from Norway and well used to the cold however they were complaining 
R0162,Very quaint French brasserie  The escargots are great and the mussels were incredibly tasty  Worth coming back to 
R0163,A wonderful night as always  excellent wine recommendations  great food and service 
R0163,Outstanding service  great wine list  delicious food
R0164,A most enjoyable evening  The staff were welcoming and friendly  It was lovely 
R0164,As always  They never disappoint  Great food  great Staff and great Service 
R0164,"Average
Carrot and coriander soup is like magnolia paint  so boring  dated and unimaginative  The chicken wrap was nothing special  tasteless  didnt know what I was eating 
The staff were inattentive and indifferent  The restaurant is shabby  Battered and torn leather seating  Scratched and battered tables making them look like they havent been cleaned  Sorry I didnt take photos of that  Clearly no updating done since the day it opened many years ago  Its not a cheap restaurant  they need to put some money into all round improvements  I wont be back "
R0164,Disappointed with food especially the fish dish which was obviously left under heater too long  No sides came with main courses 
R0164,Every cent is well spent  Wish I could go back and bring my husband with me  Hell surely love it  Oooh  wine 
R0164,Everytime we visit Alex Andrew Thomas and Eoin treat us like royality   it always a please to visit 
R0164,Food decent but service very poor  We werent even offered a drink 
R0164,"I went there with my fiance on the 9th of jan 2916 because we were so hungry 
This was the worst dining experience  food was not fresh  it must have been sitting there for days  And it tasted very bad that we couldnt find something decent to eat   and also it wasnt very clean  fried food was oozing with oil and had no flavor at all 
Do not go there even if it was the last restaurant thats open unless you really like bad food
The staff was nice but the price isnso high for such terrible food"
R0164,Its a great venue and always has been  staff etc are great  Main courses were disappointing 
R0164,Loved the food  But I would not go back  When I came in I waited a long time before I was acknowledged  Then i felt i was in the way when i was finally acknoledged by a man whi seemed to be in charge  The staff seemed frazzled and anxious which made the evening uncomfortable  I realised they seemed nervous of the maitre Dee or person in charge of them  He was rude and very brisk  The food was wholesome and really tasty but I felt unwelcome   We were a little shocked by feeling we were putting people out by being there  Staff young and maybe inexperienced but were doing their best  I feel the unwelcome feeling was coming from the people in charge of the young anxious staff who were doing their best 
R0164,Lovely atmosphere  will go back again and again
R0164,Lovely restaurant in the heart of Foxrock Co Dublin  Lovely food and good service  Comfortable and nice ambiance  Great wines 
R0164,Man who greeted us and seated us was initially rude although he at least tried to claw back on his mistake  over tables   Server was very nice and professional  The decor needs updating  The cups are wrecked and the black colour is chipped all over making them look really grubby 
R0164,Nothing to fault what so ever  Very tasty food  friendly staff and just a lovely spot for brunch
R0164,"Post New Years Eve hangover required comfort food  Wings and burgers sounded about right  

Went in to order food to go  Had a cup of tea while waiting     and waiting    and waiting  50 minutes later      

I complained because I felt that was an unacceptable wait time and I was given 25 percent off the bill  Which I was satisfied with   until I got home with the food  

Not sure I will make a return visit 

Also  they charged me for a kids milkshake  but not the meal   Not good "
R0164,"Probably one of the oiliest pizzas Ive ever had   
Cheap but ultimately not worth the price you pay with your tastebuds or your cholesterol levels  Never again "
R0164,Scratched scuffed table top  wine ordered not served  main course portion very small  asked for no peas  got them  not asked if wed like dessert  very poor overall  wont be back 
R0164,Service was very poor  Table was only half set  We had to request cutlery   We were not asked to give a drinks order  When we did order the drinks did not arrive  And the restaurant wasnt busy at the time  A frustrating experience 
R0164,"The experience was OK  We were close to the kitchen pass  and when the back door was open there was a terrible draft  

They ran out of coffee cups and we had to have our 2nd coffees in takeaway cups  

We werent rushed which was gf rear  but when we asked for extra water or another coffee the service was slow   Disappointing overall"
R0164,"The food was good as was the service   Unfortunately there were a couple of large parties which made the experience very noisy   In fact if I had not booked beforehand I would have walked straight out   It was some comfort to get put at a table far away from the loud table 

"
R0164,The restaurant paid perfect host to our party of 9 people for a week day lunch celebration  food was prompt and staff/ ambience was lovely   HAd a lovely table near the glass entrance   Staff were attentive but non intrusive  Always come here for special work/personal occasions and the Gables never fails to impress   Menu is varied and always delicious   Highly recommend 
R0164,This is a family favourite and the centre of the community  The food is consistently good and the staff are so friendly and polite  Highly recommended 
R0164,"Honestly I will never ever return here and I would advise all you yelpers to even go to the nearest tesco and get the same 3 courses for a fraction of the price 

Lastly the staff barely speak English and will have massive trouble understanding what you want to order "
R0164,very slow service  Was 5 minutes early for reservation  but we were told that our reservation wasnt until 11:30 and wed have to wait  Dont mind waiting  do mind being told what time reservation was booked for as if wed arrived 2 hours early and this was an issue  Service very slow to take order  Food came out worringly quick  Were told coffee would take a while because the barista was busy     had to ask for water 
R0164,We eat regular Irish brekafast and vegeterian breakfast and it was great food  Staff was amazing    definitly come back again 
R0164,We were very disappointed about our 1st visit  the food was below average level  personnel were not wearing uniform  the place from outside looks more beautiful than it is inside  and the value of the food didnt correspond to its quality 
R0165,Good for late night food  Had a good experience here  Good food  lively atmosphere  cool outdoor area behind the pub 
R0165,"  Was here over the weekend and got the wings which were super tasty  I tried the sweet potato fries with the yoghurt and pumpkin seeds on top also was a big fan of these  
My friends got nachos and tucked into a few of them and they were great  
But Ill be back the food was great as was the service "
R0165,Absolutely wonderful experience  Staff massively contribute to the overall experience 
R0165,All good
R0165,Answer to the above question: absolutely nothing  We went for lunch on the 2nd of December and left after the 1st course  Their wine list is ridiculous  The cheapest bottle is  Euro 38 00  This is apparently their house wine  The only problem is that they had run out of it  Okay  that happens but the restaurant is pretty new  Their next bottle is  Euro 43 00  And  guess what   They had run out of that one as well  So now you are looking at having to spend  Euro 55 00 for a bottle of wine when 2 people have gone out for a casual Saturday lunch  Forget it  My husband and I have been going out for lunch on Saturdays for many many years and we have NEVER left a restaurant after the 1st course  I suppose I should also mention that the room is depressingly drab 
R0165,"Average 
Came here early on a Saturday evening  Didnt order from the set menu  which is Euro 44  but ordered from the A La Carte  
I chose the chicken liver terrine  surf  and  turf  steak and prawns  steak cooked medium  and tiramisu for dessert  
Also had prosecco and shared a bottle of wine  Finished with an Americano 
Food was ok but couldve been hotter  Service was fine but felt incredibly rushed  Not a relaxing meal  Wouldnt return "
R0165,awesome gluten free chocolate cake   I could only eat half of it as it was so rich but yum  
R0165,Beautiful setting  service could have been better  Food was quite good
R0165,"Been here a couple of times 
Its nice coffee and decend food  the staff are very friendly  "
R0165,Best ramen in Dublin    
R0165,"Bummer  Another BBQ place I had high hopes for and it only disappointed  Ordered via app  very quick delivery  for a Friday night  but my main basically exploded inside the bag  Most of the sauce had spilled out and the chicken was partially outside the box  Sides were fine but containers covered in sauce  I think the restaurant is to blame  the box was put in the bag on its side which was a terrible choice 

As for the food  half the chicken was very dry  but the leg portion was moist and the sauce was sooo delicious  too bad I lost almost all of it to the bag   The seasoning was great and I enjoyed the parts that werent dry  big portion too  Didnt like any of the sides  again sad because slaw and sweet potato are some of my absolute favs  The slaw had chunks that were too big  but it was edible  The sweet potato mash I barely touched  baby food consistency with a weird after taste  The Mac and cheese was particularly underwhelming  absolutely no flavor  Just mush of overcooked pasta  Added salt and pepper just to eat it  

Wouldnt order again  and not sure its worth stopping by the restaurant because nothing really blew me away  Too many other places to try "
R0165,Everything outstanding as always from food to service to ambience  Highly recommended
R0165,"Excellent meal in a pleasant restaurant
Home made pasta was fabulous and my wife and son had fish
Recommended"
R0165,Excellent service  delicious food and a wonderful atmosphere  Top notch as always
R0165,Fantastic setting  incredible food and attentive  friendly service  Highly recommend 
R0165,First of all the environment was very dirty and there was no place to sit  When we came we had to wait ten minutes to doer and when we tried to order food but the women wouldnt understand what we were trying to say  She charged and my friends double the original price and it was disgrace  My friend ordered strawberry milkshake and it tasted disgusting  The water tasted horrendous  The food also took ages to come  I would never come back here again  I wouldnt recommend this place at all 
R0165,Food was really tasty and service was very good  Nice place  Main course of Halibut was memorable  Will be back soon 
R0165,Gorgeous food  fabulous ambiance and service which is excellent but never obsequious   I loved it  I will be back 
R0165,Gorgeous restaurant with a delicious menu  Food was fresh  and  tasty and service was excellent 
R0165,Great for a pint before heading to the Stadium  Best pint of Guinness  Meet the locals  One of the best Sunday Roasts 
R0165,Had a meal here for our wedding anniversary  We thoroughly enjoyed our meal; food and service was outstanding and a really lovely ambiance  Will definitely return 
R0165,Hi  We were so disappointed  Service was really bad  Went for Sunday lunch to mark a birthday and we felt so rushed from the minute we sat down  We were still chewing and not completely finished when the waiter came and took our plates  Then she forgot our drinks order twice  Very bad service  Ruined the occasion on us 
R0165,"I am shocked and appalled after being told to leave for not ordering enough items   My friend and in popped in for a bite to eat and decided upon 3 warm starters to share  This in my opinion is acceptable as we werent famished   The waiter then said we need to order more as "" This was the rule ""  "
R0165,Good food but the worst Ive been treated at a decent restaurant �or any restaurant for that matter 
R0165,I was disappointed with the standard of the seafood tower  as was my guest  We had enquired if the oysters were native i e the Edulis rather than Gigas  and were told yes they were but clearly not the case  also the large prawns were tasteless   and we only ate one  I had asked the provenance of these and was informed they came from Dublin Bay   as well as the Dublin Bay Prawns   which were fine but overcooked  but I again I feel that this was not the case  It is a shame as we have excellent seafood on our doorstep and this was in no way a reflection of what our shores have to offer
R0165,I went here for dinner with 3 friends   we had an excellent dinner  the service and ambience were wonderful and a great night was had by all 
R0165,I went here to celebrate my birthday  What s treat it turned out to be  The restaurant itself is gorgeous  It has an air of luxury and the staff are fantastic  For started I went for a shrimp and egg dish  the photo simply doesnt do it justice  the flavours were incredible  The salmon was also delicious  For my main I went for the vegetarian option as I thought it sounded interesting  This was vegetarian food done right  Again the flavours were outstanding  The dessert was interesting  a rhubarb and honeycomb concoction  Id opt for a different choice next time  Over all  a fantastic experience 
R0165,Im a local and this is my favourite restaurant in all Dublin  5 stars at 4 star prices and a great wine list  Very French in a friendly way 
R0165,If you find yourself in Dublin and your in mood for wings this should be your choice  They are small but very tasty 
R0165,If youve ever had the pleasure of eating REAL Mexican food then dont come here  Its a perfectly adequate stand in for people whove never had that pleasure  but if youre looking for something authentic then youve come to the wrong city  Youre better off going to Boojum for a semi close Chipotle experience rather than coming here The service leaves a lot to be desired  the prices are ridiculous  and the margaritas are weak  Save your time and money; eat somewhere else 
R0165,In the bar part upstairs  Had a really tasty lunch here   Value for money  Will have to go back to taste restaurant  Well done
R0165,"It then took 30+ minutes to get my food  and they didnt even bring me water while I waited  though Id asked for it   I witnessed the owner turn away a woman because he was ""too busy to take her order"" and there were maybe 12 people in the restaurant including me "
R0165,It was a great dinner  the service is always perfect  The food and the wine is the best in Dublin 
R0165,Its hard to support local businesses when they do not care about their food quality
R0165,Lamb was tough which was disappointing  They gave us extra cheese for dessert to make up for it  Would have preferred a lean piece of lamb  2nd and last visit 
R0165,Love restaurant  have been there a number  of times but always a little bit disappointed with main course
R0165,Lovely ambiance  Great food  Professional staff  If you want to quality chill with good food  calm surroundings and view onto a water feature  This is the place to go 
R0165,Lovely food  beautiful restaurant and perfect service 
R0165,"My favourite hotel and restaurant  great menu choices  cosy atmosphere and excellent service 

"
R0165,"Never actually got to taste the food so cant comment on that  however they did debit my card for payment but never actually made it to delivering any food  When I called up over an hour into waiting  the person at the other end of the phone was just plain rude  Firstly he actually sais He said he had never taken our order  and when I brought up the fact my card had money taken off and I wanted a refund he said and I quote ""not my problem"" Worst customer service ever   will not be ordering again if that wasnt obvious  Can only take comfort in the fact that with someone like this greeting paying customers  they certainly wont be around for long  "
R0165,Nice Italian food   Good selection of vines and drinks  Friendly service just double check they get the orders correct 
R0165,"Not expensive  quiet street  lovely place and perfect for a simple breakfast in a family atmospher 
Go for it you won t be disappointed"
R0165,Not the table I reserved  Uncomfortable seating  Poorly trained and disinterested staff   Service very slow  Some food and plate stone cold  Two guests received wrong main course and had long wait for replacement   We could not recommend this restaurant 
R0165,"Not very good at all 

I dont think I would ever visit this place again  "
R0165,"Ordered 2 platters from here on Saturday for my dance troupe rehersals  
I got a mixed box of 12 doughnuts and 12 cronuts  
At  Euro 60 in total including 2 coffees for the journey to the studio it was an expensive treat but oh my died and gone to sugary food heaven  
I wish I hadnt got them because now I know how Devine they are my waistline is going to suffer  

I tried the glazed cronut  the ferrero rochet and the Oreo   Bites of each  not entire portions  which I totally would have done if Id been on my own with no witnesses   

I ordered these by email at 3am the night before  because I misspelled the original email address at the normal hour of 7pm  and when I went in on Saturday morning at 10am on the button  literally as the doors were opened  the boxes were ready and waiting for me  Impressive "
R0165,Our starters included tandoori popcorn chicken bites  gunpowder prawns which were excellent quality and very meaty  asian ribs with hoisin  a MUST try  slow cooked for 16 hours and falling off the bone  and buffalo chicken wings  I dont say this lightly but the wings are definitely a contender to be the best in Dublin  I have tried ALOT  �
R0165,Overpriced for average food   Little atmosphere although gardens lovely  Not somewhere Id rush back to 
R0165,Perfect  Super family friendly service  Our 5 yr old daughter felt a princess  Food was beautiful  Overall really lovely experience
R0165,Pricey for very average food  I had booked a small cake to celebrate my daughters birthday but the staff claimed not to know anything about it    restaurant mgr later called me to say it was a staff mix up  Not good for hotel of this standard  Restaurant setting is stunning and staff were pleasant but food was only average at best 
R0165,Really enjoyed the food here   I had booked here on recommendation for my birthday and although the table setting was fabulous and the food was to die for the service severely lacked and would not appeal to 5* quality   Very long waiting time for bread at the start and staff forgot many requests including milk/sugar for coffee tea etc   cleared away dinner plates when none of the guests were finished  Waitress seemed to have very little interest in her job and it showed  Disappointing visit as I have dined in the hotel for afternoon tea and was highly impressed 
R0165,Service too slow  In for lunch and should not be so slow  Server kept apologising for being slow but nothing offered  Disappointing given what it cost 
R0165,Service was very slow and unresponsive at times  The main course was average but well below the price point  Deserts  and  coffee were very good  Could not recommend 
R0165,"Table was booked for 9PM however after walking down from the Hotel bar the table was not ready  We were sent back to the bar to wait  thankfully we were called and brought down  reason for the delay was hotel guests found it too cold to go out and were dining in and not vacating tables   hmm   We were seated at 9 30 at what should have been an area for 4 dining together  and was split between ourselves and another couple  Location of this table was by the front of an internal door with a very cold draught  I spent most of my night either closing the door myself or asking for someone else to do the same  
My food was OK  Frito Misto and Veal  my wife very disappointed   Tartare of Knife Cut Rib Eye  and Halibut   We then ordered to the cheese board to share  firstly was told this was served with cream crackers and an onion ch  our server found us some grapes  what we received  was not fitting of where the restaurant aims itself to  be and maybe even below that again 

There is a reason there are not many pictures of the internal of this restaurant as it probably is not seen as a pull factor  I was not impressed 

For the price you pay we were very disappointed from the delay at the start and the poor way it was handled right  through to the  final course   to me this is a hotel  restaurant and not much else  maybe the pricing and  promotion should reflect this "
R0165,The food is not nice at all  I ordered filet stead  it was very dry and no taste 
R0165,"The Rib Eye was luke warm when I sent it back  The veg was cold when the rib was back with me  I asked for Horse radish which never arrived 
Fiona served us and was excellent  She said the waiter placed it on another table 
Hilary had halibut and was disappointed"
R0165,This place is gorgeous  The staff is so lovely and the garden is as well 
R0165,This restaurant is in a lovely hotel in a great location but unfortunately the food and service was not great   I ordered Black Sole which is an expensive dish   It should have been delicious but was poorly cooked and tasted like rubber   Similarly the potatoes which were terrible   Not what one would expect from a  five star establishment     Extremely disappointing 
R0165,"Totally recanting my previous review  

Went there with a group of friends  We got there at 6pm  Every surface was covered in spilled drinks and soppy menus  There was no clean spot in sight  and it didnt seem that staff cared enough to clean it up 

We finally got a table and ordered some drinks  We split the margaritas  raspberry daiquiris  long islands  appletinis and killer punches 

The drinks sucked  

Well except for the killer punch 

Seriously though  

They were made so carelessly  and when we brought it to the attention of the bartenders and management we were laughed at  yelled at  and basically kicked out  

Were American college students ready to throw down money for a good time   they just lost hundreds of dollars on us 

Never been so mistreated and disrespected at a customer service establishment in my life "
R0165,Used to enjoy stopping in hear for lunch  I work just around the corner and found the staff very friendly and the food fresh  Lately the standards have taken a major down turn  First of all there is a constant over powering smell of burnt smoking cheese which lingers on your clothes even after you leave  The service and freshness of product has really gone down hill recently  Cant say Id recommend this place anymore unfortunately  
R0165,Very disappointed in the set menu  We had a voucher for three course dinner and were handed a set menu  Choice was limited and we didnt enjoy the meal  Both went for pasta main course  it was very very poor  Surprised 
R0165,Very disappointing experience  We were looking forward to a lovely evening there but left after main course due to lack of service  We waited 10min before being asked if we would like a drink which took another 15 min to arrive  A lack lustre waitress and a wait lf 1hr20min with no interaction from staff was enough for us to leave without ordering desert  Food was good but nothing spectacular  Have been to other dining options but this place certainly did not live up to expected standards  We would not return here
R0165,Very much an �all day Hotel restaurant  Would be good for casual  family friendly options  not a date night venue 
R0165,We booked here for a special occasion and decided to try out the vegan menu as  given the reputation  we felt that their vegan options would be of a very high standard  I ordered the poke bowl and my sister ordered the vegan burger  Both were mediocre  my sister was of the opinion that you could get a better vegan burger out of a van at a festival  My mother ordered the mackerel and was very happy with it  The vegan desserts were very heavy  the lemon meringue had a base youd need a kango hammer to cut through  The atmosphere was sterile and very quiet  no warmth or life  The staff were very friendly and courteous   Overall  our night was fine; I believe that the vegan options should be revised with more imaginative options that are finished to a higher standard 
R0165,We had brunch this morning in this Restaurant and thought it was fantastic  The service was top class 
R0165,We ordered the cote de boeuf  It was very disappointing  Poorly presented  The beef was tough 
R0165,We shared steak  which was not good quality with a lot of grizzle and fat on it  Not good value and cost euro80
R0165,We stepped in by chance  It was no problem to get a table  although we did not have a reservation  The location was pretty full and the food and service was decent and good  Nothing to complain about 
R0165,"We were looking forward to celebrating my husbands birthdays in here but I have to be honest  it was massively underwhelming  
We walked into the open plan dining room and there was no one to greet us  we stood at the door awkwardly while the rest of the room gawped  I had to cross the room to by the maitre d attention  
We were seated at the very back of the room which wasnt a problem as such  the problem arose when after ordering we were left for nearly over half an hour waiting for something to appear  I was told the chef was very busy  
Our drinks arrived but the waiter had forgotten what I had ordered  he blamed the bar part of the restaurant and ran off to get my Pinot noir 
When the food arrived we were again disappointed  my fritto misto was a few pieces of calamari and whatever else thrown on a long plate with a tartare type sauce   no garnish  nothing  My husbands ceviche was tasteless and bland 
Mains were again not up to scratch  I ordered the special which was pheasant  I received 2 hunks of meat with a lot of bone and a huge layer of rubbery skin on top  no crispy skin on this bird  a scraping of mashed potato and a couple of stems of broccoli    I couldnt finish it 
Husbands hamburger was middle of the road 
Our chocolate fondant that we had to wait an extra 15 minutes was pleasant but didnt redeem the experience 
To add insult to injury we were given a bill that after double checking we had been charged for a host of drinks we never ordered  Again  the bar part of the restaurant was blamed for that after we were asked to remember had we ordered a drink at a different part of the hotel    I have to say this restaurant needs some work  It definitely felt like a residents restaurant  and  overall very far away from a 5 star standard "
R0165,Went here for lunch  Burger was dismal  My friend got the seafood dish and it was not good either 
R0165,When booking I was specifically asked if there was a special occasion   I stated that it was my husbands birthday   Not once was this special occasion acknowledged throughout the evening   Disaster and most disappointing   We have eaten here since opening and we feel that the standards are dropping each time we dine 
R0165,Where do I start   It was my partners 60th birthday and as a special surprise I had booked the place online requesting the best table in the house  if available  and a birthday cake/candle to mark the occasion  |It was early on a Thursday  so I didnt see this as being too much of an ask    We arrived at 7pm  the restaurant was quiet at that time   I mentioned my name and we were given a choice of table  not particularly top    I had asked about a vacant window table but it had a booking for 8pm   Another window table became free and the  lovely waitress offered to move us  which was wonderful   We ordered our food and drinks   my partner had the Foie Gras starter and Seabream main  I had the goats cheese and beetroot starter and clam linguine main  all delicious and served with a smile    We then order a selection of cheeses to share   My partner left the table to visit the bathroom I took the opportunity to ask the waitress about the candle/cake as there had been no indication whatsoever that the online request had been noted   It was a surprise  he had no idea   She assured me that it would be delivered once we had finished our meal   That gave me comfort   The cheese board arrived   in the middle of which I felt quite unwell and paid a visit to the bathroom myself   I was gone quite some time  15 20 minutes at a guess    I arrived back to the table to find a beautiful birthday plate with candle had been presented to my partner by a waiter in my absence   My partner had blown out the candle   He was ON HIS OWN   How embarrassing for him   How thoughtless of the staff   The restaurant was very busy at the time so everyone saw the plate with lighted candle being delivered to the LONELY MAN in the corner window  seat   Photo opp gone    It would make an excellent comedy sketch  I though wryly  I bit my lip and soldiered on  still wasnt feeling 100 percent     I waited 10 minutes for the change from the bill  and then just left it with her    So disappointing
R0165,Wonder food  wonderful service and wonderful place hold a business meeting 
R0166,"
Now normally when you wait for your food its because its really good     WRONG    we waited for less then mediocre food it was bland  One of my friends even had a burnt burger in which he informed the waiter only to have a lame excuse of yes well weve had complaints before that it was too pink  So basically its a sorry excuse for your cook has inconsistency issues and cant cook  They offered him a free drink on the house really  

For myself and a friend our chowder was also lackluster a slight bit of Smoked fish and mostly cream  I also ordered mussels whose broth was basically the chowder I had with less flavor  �

The bf and other friend has the gnocchi which was okay the bread that came with it was pretty good  

Overall it is an okay place to chill hangout maybe grab a coffee a mediocre cocktail but food wise meh  Perhaps the chicken wings wouldve changed our minds but then again perhaps not  �I probably would not return since the service was horrible the food less then mediocre and the price was ridiculous for the quality of food we received "
R0166,Food was reasonable and service was good  but ambience and bar table were super
R0166,Also for the  Euro 4 50 drink specials they serve you   �the vodka that could be best described as paint stripper  �At best    �Try somewhere else     
R0166,Another lovely evening  Fantastically attentive staff who are appropriately attentive but dont hassle or intrude  The waiter serving the drinks was particularly knowledgeable about the beverages  unfortunately I didnt get his name but its the bearded gentleman who tends the bar and waits the tables on the second floor  The food was really lovely   great selection on the menu and presented to a very high standard  A lovely touch of  a special dessert for the birthday person  Altogether highly recommended
R0166,"At small round table although 3 in our party  Long delay in service  main courses luke warm and meat tough and over cooked  When complaint made  offered free desserts  Eventually offered what was termed ""complaint discount""  When asked did they consider themselves as providing fine dining they responded that they were close   unfounded optimism "
R0166,"Booked my reservation days in advance  asked for window table  When I arrived I was sit at the first table in cold draft front eh entrance just in front of the bar  Upon my questioning we were given a window table 

The food  very poor a steak with a handful of rocket with greated cheese on top  no attention nor preparation seemed to be put in it  
The fries were soft not crispy  kinda reheated 

Very plain and extremely overpriced food  we ordered steaks which werent cooked as asked from medium well it arrived rare to medium rare  bloody 

The prices were very expensive  one would expect premium service and quality of products for likewise prices  clearly not the case here 

Overall  the service was poor  the food was plain and with the least amount of preparation  the service was disappointing  My request went at first unnoticed and from window table requested  I was given a table right in front of the entrance door  The restaurant was empty I believe there were including ourselves 3 4 tables occupied 

Would not return nor recommend "
R0166,Fantastically good burger  Fries for impeccably delicious  The wait staff was extremely attentive and it was a delight to eat there 
R0166,Food awful and majorly over priced  Food was cold when arrived  Forgot sauces for both my sisters dishes which we only found out after  My sisters mash pancetta had only one piece of pancetta whereas mine was completely full and over powering   Euro 32 for steak dinner that was over seasoned and average at best 
R0166,Food was delish  Good choice of wine and fab setting x
R0166,Food was fantastic will definitely be back   outside area was beautiful
R0166,"Food was great  but pricey  Servcie was a little ""haughty""
Resaturant was very quiet  it was a Monday evening "
R0166,Food was okay but service was possibly the worst experiences in Dublin  Empty glasses for most of the evening  wrong food came  no apologies  everything took forever 
R0166,Food was terrible and service was slow  They charged me 3 Euro for an 8 oz refill of Diet Coke 
R0166,Food was tiny  over priced  bland all round awful 
R0166,General disorganization amongst staff   having to constantly ask for attention to get drinks   spend money in other words    Please dont let what is a lovely location become its former self again which was fake on substance  poor on value and generally overrated 
R0166,Gluten free menu at lunch consisted of 2 choices  soup and cod  Regular bread was served with the soup  Having visited specifically because a gluten free menu was highlighted  this was disappointing  �Other food was okay at best  The cheese in the Falafel and cheddar sandwich was rubber American style sliced cheese  �Barman was friendly but the manager seemed only just tolerant of � �tourists/visitors  Would not recommend or visit again 
R0166,Great decor  good food and presentation but the service was really not satisfying 
R0166,"Great dinner   especially the black truffle risotto  
We will be back"
R0166,Great experience  great food  great place
R0166,"Great food and coffees  Orange juice is really nice  very friendly 

We had the Irish breakfast and french toast  Also sampled some Croatian wine  vinia Laguna"
R0166,Had a bacon and cheese burger and a Moroccan lamb burger made gluten free  very easy to order for dietary requirements and friendly service and very generous portion sizes   Will be back this week for sure   
R0166,"Had high expectations due to friends recommendations and the subtle hype  Sadly the reality was a big disappointment  
"
R0166,"Hi

The table we were sitting at was inside the door with a draught all night  When I asked if we could move to a table further down we were told no as it was for three  although the table remained empty for the duration of our meal  This made no sense and showed an inability to adapt 

The service was very slow  although the waitress was lovely  Our table was booked for 6 30pm and the mains had not been served by 8 10pm  Starters were good  mains terrible  luke warm and the Gnocchi was very stodgy  We did not finish our mains and left without dessert 

did not enjoy this dinner"
R0166,I booked for a friends birthday and was hoping that the service issues Id read about in reviews post opening were just teething issues that wouldve been resolved by now but unfortunately not  Our waitress clearly wanted to be somewhere else as she practically threw the cutlery and the food on the table  We couldve gotten over that as the food was good but then the manager asked us to move to the bar after an hour and twenty minutes so he could seat another group  He offered us a drink on the house and we werent the only ones   Needless to say we left soon after  I had booked a table for New Years Eve for friends coming from abroad but will be cancelling now as Id be embarrassed for them to think that that was standard service in Ireland 
R0166,I got a burrito box  which was ok  there may as well have been no salsa as it was so flavourless but the chicken was nice enough  and that unfortunately is about the best thing I can say for the place 
R0166,"I never like to leave negative feedback but from the second we went in the staff were abrupt and made us feel unwelcome  The lady at the front desk asked us if the front door was open as ""we dont actually open until 12pm""  This was about 11:55am  When we replied yes  She said ""ok sit there you will have to wait""  We sat at our table and one of our party of 5 was running late because of the rain and traffic  This seemed a problem for one of the staff  He told us he would need the table back for 2pm  That wasnt a problem  but his delivery was rude  Some of the staff were lovely  the waitress and the barman that brought our drinks were very nice and friendly  The food is lovely but not so much so that I would recommend that my friends spend their money there  I took my aunt for her birthday as a treat  Myself and my friends like to try all the new spots in Dublin  This whole experience left us all feeling a bit deflated  In hindsight I really would have preferred to spend my money in a different venue  If you want to have a business lunch then yes  maybe give it a try  However  I would go with very little expectation of having a special experience  As Im writing this I realise I never write bad reviews as I try to be fair  I know people can just be having off days  Im quite understanding as Ive worked in the hospitality industry before   I do feel it only fair to have people informed that what might seem like a nice place to try will maybe not live up to your expectations "
R0166,I was really looking forward to trying this place and left there disappointed  The decor is stunning and the bar is fab but I was rather disappointed with the experience overall; the service with the exception of one waiter was very poor and the food was average at best  I dont like leaving bad reviews but felt I had to here 
R0166,"I will not be returning to this place  

The service was extremely poor  Although the staff were very nice there clearly was not enough  

We waiting 35 minutes for drinks and when we followed up with waiter  he had ""forgot""   We cancelled the order and asked for the bill    The food and drinks were extremely slow to arrive and food was very average   I was very disappointed about with the whole experience  If you want people to pay a bit more for a nice lunch  you need to ensure that customer service is as good as your food  Neither was the case here   We had cancelled a booking in another venue in Dublin on Sunday to go here   but I will not be returning "
R0166,If youre looking for good wholesome hearty food  at a very good price  then this is where you go   Gerrys in home from home 
R0166,Its all about the hot carvery roll   Euro 5 25 gets you a roll with beef  turkey or ham  or turkey AND ham if you ask nicely  and all the salad trimming  This thing is a monster  its essentially a carvery lunch in a roll minus the Brussels sprouts  but who wants Brussels sprouts anyway  Horrible mutant dwarf cabbages is all they are  �A bewildering array of protein bars is the gauntlet you must run to pay for your purchases  Also an Insomnia coffee stand inside  Seating area cold  and  draughty so you wont stay long  but the carvery roll makes it worth it 
R0166,"My mom and I came by here for a quick meal after touring Kilmainham Gaol  hoping to grab some food before turning in for the night  We got seated immediately  but that was the quickest part of our night  The food was average  but the service was just terrible  

Our waitress didnt know the menu at all   I tried to order the Hawaiian Pizza  and she just kept asking me if I meant the classic  I had to open the menu and point at it for her to understand  She also had trouble understanding my wine order  and forgot to bring it until a while into my actual meal  

The pizza I had was fine  it was a bit greasy and the ham was a bit too dry  but it wasnt bad and it filled me up  Then of course  a large group came in as we were finishing our meal  We had to wait  and ask multiple time to pay  It took ages  

The food here is fine  but it is not worth the confusion and unreliable service "
R0166,Not serious about being a serious restaurant  Service falls apart over the course of the dinner  Waitress disappeared  Some plates arrived missing items as described on the menu  No one checked back until waved down  Dishes were slow to clear between courses  Wines were not topped after being poured  Desserts arrived haphazardly by a staff that seemed to have checked out before the check was dropped 
R0166,"One arrival the front of house had a very upady persona  made myself and guests feel as if it was a privilege to dine here 

The service was slow  drinks took multiple asking for before receiving  they were beers  it shouldnt have taken been so slow 

The ridiculously over priced food arrived and it was cold and below par  After eating as were rushed out 

Would not recommend "
R0166,Phenomenal service and amazing food  Will definitely be back again 
R0166,Popped in here for a drink on Sunday   never realised how big the place was  Had an espresso martini which was actually very good   Think this would be a good place for a few drinks and some nibbly food 
R0166,Put  Euro 75 of J�gerbombs on my bill during a lunch with a client  When I called the manager on it he was rude and while he removed the drinks didnt see why I was upset about it 
R0166,Really unimpressed with the fish  Really dry and over cooked  The service wasnt great either  Waited 20 mins for complementary  bread and we hadnt the bread on the table five mins and main courses were out  However  had to wait far too long for dessert  Just wasnt impressed at all for the price  food was average
R0166,Second time here     love it  Great staff  delicious food and great wines   Thank you
R0166,Service was quite slow on a quiet lunchtime
R0166,Service was very good but the meal was patchy  One starter was good the other not great  Same for the mains  Given the price of the meal it was very disappointing overall  Its our second visit since it opened as and sadly we are unlikely to be back 
R0166,Staff where rude from start to finish  While at dinner we had to keep asking for water     5 times min  Why not just leave it on the table if you dont want to refill  Waited over 30mins for our desert at which point it was past 10:30 and when we requested to cancel it  it magically arrived at the table 2mins later  When we said we had waited over 30mins when requesting to cancel the waiter replied �I dont think its been 30mins  but it has been over 10mins�      rudely  unclear on the relevance of that comment  Wont be going back in a hurry 
R0166,The burger was more like a burnt hockey puck made from frozen meat and service was slow
R0166,"The food was a mix of good and bad 
Sea bream really bad  
Staff need training 
Ambiance lovely "
R0166,The food was really poor in terms of presentation and taste  I wouldnt go back and have a lot of bad experiences with Press Up Entertainment restaurants
R0166,The place has its ups and downs   theres so much potential here  but ownership/management changes in recent years have left it stuck in a rut  The house brews are good  pale ale  and  porter are especially great  and all come in for less than a fiver  
R0166,The prices are on the high side  which is the one deterrent 
R0166,The refurb is unreal  looks great  Unfortunately the food really let the venue down  Will return for a drink but not to eat 
R0166,This was a very disappointing experience  The food was very poor  I had to send my starter back  I would have done the same with my main course but my partner said not to make a fuss  I am so disappointed and wont return
R0166,Totally overstretched   The food was cold   sent it back   came back cold   Over priced and slow service   wont be going back   Looking at other reviews I dont think were alone in this type of experience 
R0166,"Unfortunately our visit wasnt great  A lot of items on the menu were not available  it was only 2pm on a Saturday afternoon  and its a nice menu but pretty short so with a few items not available we had no option but to choose food we were not that enthused about  
Also we ordered wine but it never arrived and it was ages before a staff member arrived again so we didnt get to have a drink while waiting on our food  which was the intention "
R0166,Very little flavour 
R0166,Very poor reception  very noisy  uncomfortable seating  incomplete wine list  My food choices were good but my guests got poor starters  Floor staff generally friendly but perhaps not well trained  Would we go back   under no circumstances  Definitely  one to be forgotten 
R0166,Visiting Dublin for our birthdays and it was PHENOMENAL   
R0166,"We booked for an occasion and from the onset we were disappointed  For the price youre paying and the beauty of the venue  you expect a certain standard but we were sorely disappointed  Staff were rude  both my main course and the wine we wanted werent available  there was a freezing draft into the dining room from outside  which we had to bring to our waiters attention  the music in the restaurant was that of Coppers at 3am on a Friday and the food was average for the price we paid 

It was a restaurant we were dying to go to as wed seen pictures and although Id heard mixed reviews  we wanted to see for ourselves  Overall  very disappointed given the fact that our bill was over  Euro 160 for two people  2 drinks  1 bottle of wine  2 starters  2 mains  and  1 dessert  and I wouldnt recommend it "
R0166,"We firstly waited a very long time for our drinks to be served and we ended up ordering 2 drinks each for our next round of drinks to avoid the wait  The cocktails were not very good probably because the restaurant was very busy but its no excuse  The food was only average   My fillet steak was very well done which is not what I ordered and my vegetables arrived as I finished my main course which is unacceptable 

The waiter was not attentive to our table  We had to get up from our seats and get one of the waiters to take our 2nd round of drinks   We were not offered desert or coffee  We were basically ignored for the whole meal which is unacceptable  We were we very disappointed with the whole experience "
R0166,"We had a reservation for 4 people  lunch  Service was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING   We waited for more than 1 hour before getting our food  4 dishes which were all the same   

After one hour waiting with no one coming to us asking if we were ok or offering to check with the kitchen  we asked the waitress what the matter was with our order  She said ""the starter slowed down the mains""  I have to point out that the only starter we got was smoked salmon  meaning nothing to cook or to prepare  but just smoked salmon to transfer from the fridge to a plate  She said she would nonetheless check with the kitchen and let us know  She came back saying that she could confirm that  indeed  ""the starter slowed down the mains""  I wonder  how long would we have been waiting for if the starter was something more sophisticated than simply smoked salmon   

Meanwhile  we could see many other dishes being brought to tables of customers who arrived after us  

This said  what we did not appreciate was the rudeness and the way they left us there by blaming the delay on us  They never apologized for the delay  they never came to us checking if we were ok  the only thing they could do was blaming their bad service on us because we ordered a starter    now  I go to Dublin restaurants every weekend and no one has ever used such a ridiculous excuse 

I totally understand if you get a bad service in a pub or cheap restaurant  But this is not a pub and you pay for what you eat  even more than the average as we spent nearly 130 EUR  for 1 starter  4 mains and no wine or dessert     

People might think that  as an Italian  I might have too high standards when it comes to food / restaurants  Thats true  but I can guarantee I found places in Dublin that meet these standards   However  being an ""international couple""  this is the point of view of both an Irish person and an Italian "
R0166,"We had lunch in here  It was so cold half the party kept their coats on and we decided to have our coffees in the smoking area so that we could feel the heat from the overhead heaters  only for the roof to be opened on us  
The salads are too small and there was a chicken bone in the club sandwich  
We were left waiting a long tome for our meal  then our coffees and then our bill  
Overall not a great experience"
R0166,We went for lunch on Saturday and the food was delicious and great value for the price of the menu  cocktails were fab
R0166,We went for lunch after a graduation  the venue is gorgeous and the food tasted great  However  the portions were quite small and we were left very hungry  The service was also extremely slow  I am not sure if it was just understaffed but our waitress was very slow  It took nearly 20 minutes to receive a drink order and a really long wait to receive a dessert menu  We had to chase down our waitress as she never checked in on us when after the food came out which did take away from the experience as we had to wait to find the waitress which took far to long and then the wait after the drink order was taken meant we only got 2 drinks over nearly 2 hours  We also found the waitress a bit unhelpful as we asked for various menu recommendations and if we needed extra side portions for certain mains  to which we were told no  As the kitchen closed at 3  we were not told this upon booking  we were unable to order extra sides and therefore were left hungry as some of the mains were fairly small  While the overall venue was lovely and the taste of the food was nice  I do not know if I would be ready to go back  solely based on the slow and unhelpful service
R0166,"We were left waiting way too long for to be asked for drinks    on the second round had to ask for them   Then they forgot about us    asked for bread at the start and got it a minute before the main course 
Food was nice but not amazing  Cocktails were excellent 
A Friend tried to ring them twice to buy me drinks for my birthday  but was put on hold and then cut off twice 
Over all was not impressed 
Would not recommend it and will not be back "
R0166,We were seated in a separated room on the top floor  Nobody came near us or gave us a drink menu for 30 minutes  We mentioned this to our server and asked could we move  They moved us to �the best seat in the house� where we were ignored again until we caught someones attention  The drinks were slow  the food was average and our plates werent cleared  The bathrooms were not maintained  We would not recommend 
R0166,Waiting staff gave perfect service  friendly staff 
R0166,"Wish Id checked yelp before popping in here for a fast take away lunch  Theres always a queue so I figured it must be decent  �Nope  

Went for the pad thai  Pretty grim to be honest  Dry and hardly any veg/chicken/nuts  

1 star for taste  �Have given them a 2nd star as theres lots of it and its cheap and thats what matters to some people  Not me  �Wont be back "
R0166,Wonderful food  great staff and excellent wine selection 
R0167,A bit disappointed with the food  We were expecting a better quality  even though it was luch time    
R0167,Absolutely fabulous 
R0167,After looking up places to eat on web I saw soup dragon and wanted to try it  Wasnt disappointed  cute little place and delicious selection of soups  I had the chili beef was very nice highly recommend
R0167,As a solo traveller the staff make you feel very welcome and with great food  I actually visited twice in one week
R0167,Cozy spot with a tasty cheeseburger  They good have hand cut and sweet potato fries  but the shoestring fries were my favorite  Expect a wait  but worth it 
R0167,Disappointed website or bookings didnt mention upstairs closed when requested specifically hottest day of the year town packed with customers
R0167,Excellent service food and atmosphere   Great value for money  Staff very attentive and helpful  Cant recommend this restaurant enough
R0167,Fabulously tasty food in a quirky setting  Perfect location close to the hustle of the city centre 
R0167,The water tasted horrendous  The food also took ages to come  I would never come back here again  I wouldnt recommend this place at all 
R0167,Good honest food  nothing extravagant  Id expect more choice when it comes to fish  Nice  cosy place and handy on the way to / from cinema
R0167,Gorgeous food  and  great service
R0167,Great food and service  bustling atmosphere  Lovely spot 
R0167,Healthy  tasty and colorful food for a good price  Very friendly staff  Nice and strong coffee  Good for breakfast and lunch 
R0167,Im from the States  Everything is deep fried  Same here  Even the BBQ ribs or so called ribs are deep fried  Lots of batter on the fish remove and the fish is OK  and unless you ask you will not get any condiments  Will not go back unless I have lots of antacids on hand 
R0167,It was a celebration and the staff looked after us really well  Foid was delicious for everyone at our table of 8  Will definitely go back  Thanks 
R0167,It was fine food was special 
R0167,Lovely room upstairs however the staff were incredibly rude when it came to presenting the bill  Having asked us if we would like another drink they arrived at the table with the bill and told us the needed the table back  We asked if there was room at the bar downstairs to finish our drinks  they said they didnt know and we would have to leave they then began to clear the table  It spoiled a nice catch up 
R0167,Not the restaurant it used to be  No french dishes  Limited wine selection  Novice servers and barman  Dirty glasses  Its obviously under different management from two years ago when it was an exceptional place  Disappointing 
R0167,"On arrival at 1 00 we requested a table at the wall and were just told �no  We enquired again a second time and it was grudgingly given with the proviso that we would be out by 2 30 which we had planned to do anyway  2 of us had cod which arrived luke warm after a long wait  
Overall we did not feel welcome and the food was unfortunately poor "
R0167,Our group didnt eat all food and waitress didnt even ask was food tasty or something 
R0167,Restaurant was too dark so found it hard to read the menu  Dust all over the little light on the table  My girlfriend ordered gluten free bread but was given bread with wheat  Took nearly 10mins to get new bread for her charcuterie  The Parmesan chips didnt arrive with the rest of the main course  came out 10mins late  Main course was ok but not worth  Euro 26  When we received the bill they overcharged one of the starters by  Euro 3  Overall not a good experience 
R0167,Seemed like a cool spot  good crowd   A little rushed from the waiter   Filet wasnt hot and was very bland    Very disappointing as the butcher shop looked good and hotel recommended it   Pretty weak overall
R0167,Stopped by here a couple days ago and we were delighted by the food we got  Walking by we were drawn in by the wonderful smell  Generous servings and friendly service  
R0167,Tasty good for at reasonable prices  What more could anyone want  The staff are friendly and the service is good  Happy days
R0167,The main problem for me was I had rang ahead and asked for separate bill for wine and prosecco which I had ordered  bill came at end for everything together  I was very upset as everybody then divided the bill  I did  not want this and was very embarrassed as it was a lot  for each individual to pay  When I rang the girl assured me the bills would be separate  It ruined  the evening for me 
R0167,This is a tourist trap  Table are assigned for 2 h with the implication that they through you out  We had a reservation for 4 and I only wanted to eat and appetizer since I was not hungry with the other ordering 3 course meals  I was rudely informed that I had to order 2 appetizers  which I refused   Food was mediocre  Can not recommend 
R0167,"Took long to get our order in  waitresses forgot our drinks  and we never got our egg inside the ramen  The tonkotsu red isnt even spicy  its SWEET  which is odd   They use a sweet and sour ""spice""  I was really disappointed  Honestly the worst ramen Ive ever had "
R0167,Very enjoyable but to anxious for you to finish up 
R0167,"We did not stay to eat  because we were received in a hostile fashion  They should also change the term ""TOP TABLE"" to ""HIGH TABLE""  I took Top Table to mean BEST area  I will NEVER book that restaurant again  They are very ignorant when it comes to running a good service restaurant  I can elaborate much more  but you will be bored with my complaints "
R0167,We had a wonderful dinner there with my husband and two teenage children  The food was delicious and the intimate ambience and service were excellent  We wanted to go back there the next day also  I highly recommend this restaurant while you are in Dublin  excellent value too 
R0167,With booking confirmation  we got worst table ever  just behind the entrance door and with cloth hanger behind our backs  just told the other table was reserved  no one never arrived and in the main room plenty of space but because they assumed we wanted more privacy and been away from a crying baby  we got that  Then  Sundays do not have full menu  just a set menu with average food  not impressed  quite disappointed 
R0168,Dont book online as we arrived and they were closed and the owner said he hasnt registered for online booking  
R0169,"Avoid 

This place is one of the most overpriced dumps I know in Dublin  Its a tourist trap for people getting off buses and tour groups around the area  You wouldnt mind the prices as much if the food is good"
R0169,Excellent service and a nice pub  food was above average 
R0169,Good food  good coffee  The have good options for those looking for something healthier or vegetarian
R0169,Hadnt paid their skybox so no tv was working for champions league final  Had no place saved for us and lady behind the bar was incredibly rude  Such a shame as could be a great bar
R0169,"I felt this place has a lot of potential  A cooking school  crowded and a lot of real Italian vibe to it  Plus with the high rating I decided why not  After we were seated by the door  we were constantly greeted with the choking smell of cigarettes by people standing out front of the open door smoking  I cant eat around smokers since it ruins the experience  It also took us over 1 hour to get our food  mind you it was just 4 of us  I received my food to scarf it down  It was so bland that not enough shaved mozzarella or cracked pepper could save it  I was starving  so it didnt matter 

When it came to paying we told them the amount and put this half on one card and the other on this card  They overcharged us at least  Euro 5  If I were in town again I wouldnt be back  Everyone else agreed the food was very bland and we each had something different"
R0169,It is highly recommended  simple menu  exceptionally good service  and a really nice place to spend a few hours  Staff were accommodating and friendly  the style of the place and the food is unfussy  and the music and atmosphere was just perfect 
R0169,"Love the deals you can look up online on their offers website  I had dough balls and melanzane al forno  

My friend had a four seasons pizza  which is technically no longer on the menu  but the staff were flexible and made it for her nonetheless  

All delicious "
R0169,Service and bar ambience was good but food served was pretty poor  Like Chipper food standard served on a plate 
R0169,The food was not very good  I expected more  The ambient was nice and the service was fast 
R0169,"There is plenty of seating 
The wait times on queues can get quite big 
The bathroom is quite large 
Food is cheap and OK like in all similar stores "
R0169,This has been the most unwelcoming restaurant I have ever been to  ever  The wait staff was rude  acted like they didnt even want us there  then rushed us to leave  I felt almost embarrassed because it was so apparent we were not welcomed  Not to mention the food is just okay  its nothing to write home about 
R0169,This is a really lovely pub but dont bother with the food   its terrible 
R0169,This is the best duck in Dublin  Great if you just want to grab and go  They also do pork and chicken  I recommend the aromatic duck pancakes  because they are so delicious 
R0169,"We decided to go here based on other recommendations but were disappointed 

It turns out that Tuesdays is local newcomer night and the I will be charitable and say that the quality was variable   Also if you are looking for traditional Irish music this is the place for you "
R0170,A nice casual Mexican joint with great food and friendly staff  It also offered a lot of vegan options which was great 
R0170,Amazing pitchers of Mojito and Margaritas  The tacos  tequila wings  and nachos are a must 
R0170,At Christmas I had booked a table for 7 people   there was a large party of maybe 20 people before us   we sat waiting two hours to be told that it would be another 45 mins before we would get our food as they needed to serve the bigger party before us   we had only ordered simple things like burritos and nachos  We had to leave as we had spent 200 euro on alcohol as we had been waiting for so long   then they had the audacity to try and put a service charge on the bill when we had received no food   we left as we couldnt wait any longer  It was an absolute disgrace   we will never go back there again 
R0170,Delicious A+
R0170,Food was delicious and plentiful  Service was friendly and efficient  Great atmosphere  I thought it was good value for money as well 
R0170,Food was unpleasant looking as it was to taste   Not even someone I didnt like 
R0170,Fries taste like they were sitting around  shepherds pie  beef  was super dry  first in Ireland   and the salad a bit laughable side  The lasagna is decent and the service pretty much as expected 
R0170,Great food and fast service  Loved the variety of vegan options on the menu 
R0170,Great place  good food and a excelent service  can highly recommend it  
R0170,"Seated quickly  but but it took a while to get the floor staffs attention again to order  But then the food came very quick  And there was lots of it  

My dish was fine  sweet and sour chicken  Although I could have done with a steak knife to cut the chicken  which was battered  

My partners dish of beef in black bean sauce was pretty awful if I am honest 

The rice was not nice either    how hard is it to get steamed rice wrong 

We wont be back "
R0170,"the best quality Mexican food in the city  Their recent moved  and has meant a brand new look but its got the same great food  drink and service 

The prices are extremely reasonable  they even do a lunch deal for  Euro 10 which includes Burrito/Taco  fries and a drink   

The menu has some great choices from
Chimichangas  my favourite  to tacos  burritos  etc  Theyve even got some unusual dishes to try  The cocktails and drink selection is great too   strong and tasty Margaritas are the best 

The service is fantastic   they always greet with a smile and food comes quickly  

Would highly recommend  Best Mexican in Dublin  and one of the only ones on online booking which is super handy  "
R0170,"The food was excellent  Unfortunately we had to wait over an hour for it to arrive while we were repeatedly offered drinks rather cynically in the interim  The waitress was quite pushy when asking for drinks orders  

Excellent food but extremely slow service you might starve to death before it arrives "
R0170,The food was not nice at all  It isnt expensive but I would rather pay more money and eat nice Mexican food 
R0170,We couldnt find it and when we rang to ask for directions they werent very clear
R0170,"Whats the story with the most uncomfortable seats in the world in your smoking area  Seriously they are terrible 
Get over yourselves with your non smoking comfy area around the corner   Sorry wont be back"
R0170,While all looked well initially with a nice lively cantina like atmosphere the food was pretty disappointing  Nachos were very poor with strange Tortilla chips and very limited toppings which meant it was very overpriced at 9 95 Euros  Vegetarian burrito was filled with undercooked rice while the chicken fajitas had dry overcooked chicken although the et of the dish was fine  Pitcher of margarita was tasty though only had a hint of tequila which seemed was bad value at 25 Euros  Overall a disappointing experience 
R0171,Awesome food and an absolutely beautiful space 
R0171,Birthday breakfast   simply superb   
R0171,Excellent as always
R0171,Excellent food and service but a little too noisy  The latter not a problem being with friends but rather with business partners/clients 
R0171,Great place
R0171,We had an excellent meal and really enjoyed the night 
R0171,Went for lunch and hadnt one complaint  The food was amazing  Everything you could want for a special get together
R0171,"Great decor 
Amazing service"
R0171,Expensive but amazing  food and extremely beautiful setting  
R0171,It is nicely furnished and a nice ambience  The service was quite good  
R0171,The food and portion size was perfect  The food was tasty
R0171," setting is very nicely done 
The bar area is very cool and inviting 
The staff were very welcoming
The food was disappointing 
My son ordered a medium rare steak and it arrived well done it was taken back and later arrived back the exact same steak 
There were four of us and two main courses arrived while we waited for the other two main courses which meant our food chilled down especially our chips  I couldnt honestly recommend it from food point of view  The desserts were good  It was disappointing as it was a special evening out "
R0171,"  very poor value  being charged extra for bearnaise sauce with a steak  and extra again for chips is like the business Ryanair model  rather than a plush place that  is aiming for
  placed too close to next table  despite there being lots of empty tables after about 30 mins of us arriving
  3 different people waiting on us as shifts ended
  very disappointed with it
  there are far better places to go in Dublin for value and atmosphere"
R0171,1st time experiencing   will 100 percent recommend  and  come back 
R0171,"2nd time there  2nd time no tuna available  2nd time to be overcharged  Need more ""Brunch"" dishes on their Brunch menu  I had the eggs benedict  ham didnt taste of very much  Hollandaise sauce is obviously poured  from a bottle and doesnt look very pleasing  Not much taste overall"
R0171,2nd visit to  as had a fantastic experience on 1st  was very disappointed with the standard of the food
R0171,5 star experience   This place is a real treat and the decor is fabulous 
R0171,5star service  Outstanding  I will come back  Congratulations to Meagan service  who was amazing with us  Superb experience and service 
R0171,"7 friends who met in UCD 1983   
Food was fantastic and it was a super venue   
Highly recommend it "
R0171,"9:00 pm booking  Took nearly an hour from finishing our starter before our main course arrived  Resident DJ played music so loud  it was difficult to hold a conversation at the table  My main course  black cod cooked in a banana leaf  was bland and worse still  only lukewarm  The truffle and Parmesan chips were so greasy I couldnt eat them  I should have complained but when I weighed up the negative effect it would have on my evening and the additional delay it would cause to me actually eating my meal  I decided it wasnt worth the trouble  
They took ages to clear our plates away  Very slow taking drink orders  This was my first experience of  and quite probably my last "
R0171,"A complete rip off  grilled cheese    Euro 9 for toast  bread  cheese and a few chips  Luke warm cappuccino in a tiny cups for  Euro 3  Server was rude and obnoxious when asked anything 
Avoid this place at all cost

The service is excellent and the food was fabulous  Well certainly be back in the future  Thanks a million "
R0171,A lovely experience great service  Will definetley be going back 
R0171,A very tasty starter of prawn risotto was followed by a a very good lamb shank and things were going nicely  Unfortunately these two delights were followed by awful cheesecake  which three of us sent back  and to cap it off the coffee was brutal 
R0171,"A wonderful dining experience  Our waiter was most helpful and accommodating  
Beautiful decor  Full house but noise was never a problem "
R0171,A wonderful experience  will definitely be back   Thank you 
R0171,Absolutely beautiful restaurant although the service was not up to par  We had to flag our waiter down multiple times to order and get the cheque  There was a 40 min gap between our appetizers and entrees and when we finally did receive our entrees they were cold  Stunning restaurant but the service and food fell short 
R0171,Absolutely delicious  great attention to detail  Our waiter was courteous and helpful  Wonderful and would recommend

R0171,"Adored the ambiance the decor the buzz in the place  
The service was too slow however 
We Chose the pancakes   their cream filling / natural yoghurt was awful 
We had some danish Pastries   they were sodden and oily    very poor quality 
The scrambled egg was barely cooked fully  

I hope you can improve the food quality 
The presentation is gorgeous  
Will go again for these reasons and select food more carefully next time "
R0171,Absolutely wonderful restaurant  for breakfast lunch and dinner  the atmosphere was amazing  food was amazing  service was over and above the best Ive ever had  we went for a birthday occasion and were made feel very special  highly recommended and cant wait to go back

R0171,After being sat at 11 30 and ordered within 10 minutes  45 minutes later we still hadnt even received our drinks and when I asked a waitress to check she said nothing had been put through for us and what did we order  At the time the restaurant was less than half full which warrants no delay  Extremely disappointed as I had such high expectations given  chains reputation 
R0171,Extremely disappointed as I had such high expectations given  chains reputation 
R0171,"After booking 3 months in advance for a very special occasion  our table was not ready  30 mins late in fact  After which time we were seated only 2 b asked 2 move   between courses  to accommodate a large party  We had our entire occasion spoilt  and  left to feel insignificant in the presence of a very corporate set  Our bill was taken care of by management however  which was the very least that they could do 
The lighting in the rest rooms was appalling to say the least  A certain ambience is obviously tried to be achieved however its not an acceptable or functioning level of lighting for your guests  let alone any cleaning staff trying to be effective "
R0171,Afternoon tea very disappointing  Special occasion for my Mum; lovely decor and surrounding  Service poor  food poor    a shame

R0171,All went fine  Great food
R0171,Although I think this is a very nice restaurant I was very disappointed with the standard of the food   The burger meat was of a very low standard and my partners steak was very tough

R0171,"Ambiance  service and decor were all first class  The staff could not have done enough and were very friendly  The food was only mediocre at best unfortunately  at those prices you expect tasty food  The cocktails and wine were top notch  It still didnt take away from the experience that was "" ""

R0171,"Arrived at  Dublin for a 3 15 Afternoon Tea reservation for 2  Two ladies before us were being looked after by the desk and were asked if they wanted to leave anything in the cloakroom however the same question  was not asked to us   
We were informed the table was not ready and given a card with my name on it  however were not informed or shown where to go to wait  I had to ask  
We ordered a drink at the bar the table was ready around 15 mins later  
We asked for afternoon tea  as per reservation    we were not shown Tea menus and when asked what tea they had we were informed they had everything  
Our tiers arrived but we were disappointed to find no finger sandwiches   only brioche rolls Ive never had afternoon tea without sandwiches 
At no stage were we offered clean cutlery/ plate during our visit   dissapointling I had to used my tea spoon to put jam  and  cream On my scone   
Our tea was gone however the waiter never came back to check on us eventually we ended up calling the waiter to ask for more  again no tea menu  
At 5 03 we ordered a drink and were informed that we had 12 mins left on the table   Even though we didnt get the table until around 3 30 with our afternoon tea order given to the waiter around 3 37   

When given the bill the manager asked was everything ok and I mentioned the cutlery issue/ no tea menu etc but no concession was offered or given on our bill  

Overall We wont be rushing back to  the best part of the experience was the decor unfortunately all Expectations of wonderful food and service were sorely lacking "
R0171,Arrived early and wanted to have a drink outside and were told there was no service outside  We went elsewhere for pre dinner drink as there was no room at the bar  When we returned tables outside were being used by younger crowd  Hmmm   Food good front of house awful and service really poor  Bill incorrect and 2 mistakes made with order
R0171,Arrived early for afternoon tea on 20th of December  Decided to have a drink  no seats at the bar  fair enough  Christmas week  but really annoying when trying to order a drink and staff deliberately avoid your eye   Probably one of the cheapest options around for afternoon tea and   it shows  Got chicken on a brioche roll  Dry and tasteless  Cucumber sandwich  sort of  was okayish but bread was definitely not fresh  Asked for more tea but never arrived   Mini desserts were definitely better  For first time ever in any restaurant  we did nt leave a tip  Staff are efficient  some of them  but there is no warmth with them  I would nt recommend it to anyone  I actually cancelled a reservation for brunch as it would have been more of the same  Disappointing  Busy at Christmas but once the hype is over  will it survive  Would definitely need some changes 
R0171,"arrived to a not so warm welcome  placed our order to then be told that both our mains were no longer
available   Champagne was bought for me as a birthday present the staff put the bottle in a wine cooler along with other wines they were slow to refill and a customer on another table took our bottle and was going to enjoy my champagne until i stopped them   plates were left empty in front of us for some time with staff passing us looking at plates and moving on   we seemed to have 3 or 4 different servers so no one
keeping an eye on our meal service   it took over 30 mins to get our bill when we were ready to leave 
1 positive is that the steak that i did end up ordering cooked perfectly and tasting great   I will not be
rushing back "
R0171,As always  food service  and  ambience fabulous 
R0171,Ate here  five out of five days we were in Dublin  Awesome restaurant with exceptional good drinks and excellent food
R0171,Atmosphere is fantastic  fabulous decor great food and friendly staff   Ill be back 
R0171,"Average  
Front of house made a fuss about finding the booking despite the restaurant only having 5 tables in use  Placed us in small table next to two other parties despite rest of restaurant unoccupied  
Food ok and reasonably priced  but not worth the hype"
R0171,Awful awful food  Prawn cocktail was in lettuce that was brown and the tomatoes I could have made soup with  My partners chicken was like a birds eye frozen piece of chicken  I would never ever go back  Actually so disgusted by the food when they charge high prices and use the worst ingredients 
R0171,"Awesome  My second visit

Three more visits booked for this side of Christmas 

2 birthdays     and  Christmas Eve     "
R0171,"Awful 
I booked a table for my husband and I to have cream tea  a treat for his birthday  We got seated and ordered and I advised the waiter I was not able to eat strawberry jame so he offered me apricot  yummy  Three scones arrived  small  but warm  No tea however  We sat  10 minutes later I had to ask where the tea was  They went off to get it and it was the colour of hot water  I told the waiter who went and got another pot  this time with two tea bags and not just one in a large pot  Started eating the scones  which by now wer cold and hard  All in all a very disappointing visit and we wont be going back  Not what I had expected since we have dined in other this placerestaurants where the food and service were hugely better   Not a nice  end to what had been a lovely day out "
R0171,"Bar staff unfriendly boardering on rude  Food everage and luke warm  
Ambience and decor is nice but all I all very unimpressed"
R0171,"1  Poor Service 

2  The waiting staff forgot it was my partners Birthday   Despite two reminders   

3  The food portions   except the steak   were very very small 

4  In terms of cost v experience I was very very disapointed 

5   sells itself as a High End resteraunt   The only thing High End was the cost   very very disapointing"
R0171,"Based on our last trip we will not be returning   The following are the reasons why : 
Poor Service 
The waiting staff forgot it was my partners Birthday   Despite two reminders   
sells itself as a High End resteraunt   The only thing High End was the cost   very very disapointing"
R0171,Beautiful decor  beautiful people and a nice buzzy feel to the place  Sadly thats where the positives end  the minute we sat down   we were asked if we wanted to order drinks  As we were waiting for a third person to arrive  said no thanks  we d wait  Two other waiters came at different intervals to ask would we order drinks  We succumbed to the pressure and ordered coffees and water  neither arrived for 25 mins  and coffees were cold at this stage  Ordered veggie breakfast  which took an hour to arrive   but our toast came 30 mins before breakfast  asked for fresh toast to be brought with breakfast and a pot of tea   this second toast arrived 10  mins before breakfast and tea was well after it  Servers didnt clear the table of the old coffees/plates etc  even though table obviously too full and coffees fully finished  Had to flag down staff for any kind of service  amazing at avoiding eye contact  Bill took forever to arrive  only managers can accept payment for some weird reason  so went straight to till to pay to try and speed it up  Lots of staff  well suited and well dressed managerial staff walking around looking busy but not doing much  Clearly something seriously wrong with the kitchen system and with managing the floor staff  This place may be hard to get booking in   but I predict this wont be for too much longer   you cant ride on the coattails of a London name  and a glitzy decor  you need substance to survive in Dublin  I wont be back   Euro 64 for lukewarm breakfast for 3 with 3 cold coffees and freezing cold toast  Pretty disgraceful really
R0171,Beautiful decor  fantastic staff  food very poor  I was very disappointed  I had the fish and chips the batter and chips were very over cooked  I know that new busy restaurants take time to find there feet but if you cant cook chips thats a problem 
R0171,"Beautiful atmosphere and decor
A wonderful experience 
Most enjoyable
Impeccable food"
R0171,Beautiful birthday meal in gorgeous surroundings 
R0171,Beautiful decor and ambiance  Food was great and very reasonable
R0171,There is 12 5 percent service charge added automatically to the bill Overall experience was disappointing and I would not go back 
R0171,"Beautiful interior design   apart of that ""double"" tables are so close to each other that it is impossible to have a private chat or to relax while having a meal Menu looks vary attractive and there are interesting options to choose from I had a monkfish and prawn curry which was flavorsome however contained low quality prawns  more like small shrimps  and off cuts of monkfish  Staff seemed to be idle   with so many employees walking around service was rather poor  There is 12 5 percent service charge added automativally to the bill Overall experience was disappointing and I would not go back "
R0171,Beautiful decor  The staff were efficient and pleasant  The food was good  Well be back

R0171,Beautiful interior  delicious food and super friendly staff 
R0171,"Beautiful restaurant but service was poor  Problem with the plumbing and bathrooms were out of use so patrons of the restaurant were told to use a toilet in a venue accross the road  No  coffee /teaserved due to lack of water  and very surprsied at  no offer of a complimentary ""anything"" to make up for the inconvenience 
Specail on thr day was ""Sole"" which we found was priced at  Euro 42 with no extras or sides when we got the bill  Waitress was trying to push the Specials and possibly because of the pricing 
Expensive  given that the rest of the meals on the menu are well priced  Disappointing overall as any of the issues we had are easily resolved and rectified "
R0171,Beautiful meal   extremely helpful and friendly staff and over all very enjoyable experience 
R0171,Beautiful meal in beautiful surroundings  Definitely return for a visit
R0171,Beautiful place very nice food and desert friendly staff
R0171,Beautiful restaurant with poor service 
R0171,Beautiful restaurant and a real treat to go to  Food is a little bit expensive but for a one of great it is definitely worthwhile 
R0171,Beautiful restaurant  but the service was appalling 
R0171,We were 50mins waiting on our table but were still asked to leave 1 5hours after we sat down so we didnt get our 2hour sitting despite initial assurances we wouldnt be impacted once we got our table 
R0171,Beautiful restaurant  food only ok  We were 50mins waiting on our table but were still asked to leave 1 5hours after we sat down so we didnt get our 2hour sitting despite initial assurances we wouldnt be impacted once we got our table  Bad service
R0171,"Beautiful room and decor but food very disappointing  
The fillet steak was tiny and dry and tasteless  The burger was totally dry

We would not recommend this restaurant "
R0171,Beautiful restaurant great food Fabulous atmosphere Well definitely be back 
R0171,Beautiful restaurant  Fantastic service  Friendly and unobtrusive  Delicious food beautifully presented  Wonderful evening
R0171,Beautiful restaurant  Visited Easter Sunday night  Struck gold with great food and fabulous attentive waiter 
R0171,Beautiful setting but it is let down by its service and mediocre food  We waited half an hour after being seated for someone to take our order which was only taken after I had informed a member of staff that we had been waiting for quite a while  After our table was cleared we waited a further 15 minutes to receive dessert menus  again only provided after I informed the waiting staff  Another long wait followed to actually have our dessert order taken  This made for an all round unsatisfactory and disappointing dining experience 
R0171,Beautiful setting and decor but the food was pretty average  A wide selection but basic dishes   less options but done better would be my suggestion 
R0171,Beautiful Surroundings  but a long way to go to capture the ambiance of    London  Food good  service poor  I ordered a desert  it never came  Got the wrong bill  No doubt there are teething issues  I will be back  but expect better next time 
R0171,Been a few times but this one was terrible  Waiter looking around distracted and kept missing our order  Then he started clearing the next table and dropped a jug of pepper sauce from it onto our table leaving it covered  He dabbed it a bit with a napkin and half apologised before just walking off   I had to call another staff member over to ask them to change the table cloth and get my other half a fresh napkin  They didnt seem to think there was anything wrong with having a wet table cloth soaked in someone elses food  and not just a very small amount  they had dropped on it  Had to repeatedly signal over 10 minutes to get a waiters attention for a drinks order  Then before our time slot was even up and while we were having our coffees they made us get up and carry them to another table so they could join ours up to other ones to make a group one for a later booking  Awful awful awful service 
R0171,Best breakfast experience Ive had in Dublin  Very good service  fair prices and portions  outstanding food quality and taste  Cannot wait to come back for a fry up 
R0171,"Big treat for my daughters 
Food mediocre at best 
Staff v little eye contact 
All round disappointing felt rushed to leave should of stayed at hotel "
R0171,"Birthday celebration that was celebrated by restaurant with cupcake and candle on top 
Wine is expensive plonk basically  Euro 29 for a  Euro 4 supermarket brand 
Good was average but bland 
Staff however were very attentive and credit to restaurant 
Overall a restaurant living on the reputation of its sister in London"
R0171,"Birthday

Andre was an excellent waiter"
R0171,Birthday for my daughter  Staff could not have been more helpful and provided a little pastry with a candle in it  was all just magical 
R0171,Bistro style tables for 2 too close  We were very lucky to get a corner table which was lovely  Prices good for lunchtime meeting 
R0171,"Booked a table for breakfast with a friend 
The venue is very well presented and the staff are friendly 
We ordered cocktails and coffees  both were good   not great  Cocktail selection is a bit boring considering the opulent surroundings 
The food was a huge let down  Even presentation of the food was very basic 
I ordered the Avocado and spinach Benedict  on toast instead of the soda farls  see photo  and the presentation was appalling  It was cold and very tasteless  
My companion ordered the Gluten free buttermilk pancakes   the warm strawberry sauce was just like a runny syrup  overly sweet and sickly 
Seems like people are more interested in being photographer here than enjoying food and drinks 
   Style over Substance "
R0171,"Booked for drinks for 3 people but when we arrived we were told we they dont offer bookings just for drinks normally and that we needed to also get food  We had already gone for dinner so we just ordered dessert  

Service was pretty bad   tried to get a waiters attention and they just rushed by and pretended they didnt see us 

Didnt enjoy the experience and wouldnt go back "
R0171,Was disappointed service charge was already added to bill  Paid and on way out explained our disappointment to hostess 
R0171,Booked in advance for breakfast while visiting Dublin  greeted by friendly hostess  ordered breakfast from waiter   pancakes  granola  granary toast  americano and tea  Pancakes and granola arrived some time later   no sign of drinks or toast  asked waiter and he said they would be some time  Finished eating pancakes and granola  had to ask waitress yet again about drinks and toast  She brought drinks some time later   still no toast  Cancelled toast with waitress and asked for bill  Was disappointed service charge was already added to bill  Paid and on way out explained our disappointment to hostess 
R0171,I will not be recommending this restaurant to any one 
R0171,Booked this restaurant to celebrate with my family following graduation  We were looking forward to the  meal but the service was so poor and topped off with sub standard food that it really was a disappointment for our special celebration   While we knew the price before the meal  what you pay for is the atmosphere  Out order was not taken for half an hour after we were seated and even asking multiple times to order  A very disappointing experience  I will not be recommending this restaurant to any one 
R0171,Both dishes arrived cold  Fish cake and Seabass  Very very disappointed as it was s special occasion   Staff were professional and nice but to get the basics wrong is not good  did not send back as I did not want meals microwaved   Was not happy at all paying for cold food  
R0171,"Both Myself and Wife attended  on Saturday the 6th Of April
We had a drink at the Bar and we were then shown to our Table 20 mins after our allotted time 
This was not a problem which we explained to the staff 

We were then shown to our seats and given the menu
after about ten minutes we were asked to vacate our seats as the area had been booked for another party of 14 
Both Myself and my wife said we would vacate if another seat could be found that we liked
the manager never came back to us for 20 mins and in that time we could not order as we did not know were we would be seated  eventually another manager offered us a drink each and said we would remain were we originally seated The night was slightly ruined by the delays and uncertainty but our waiter was very nice and apologetic on the night"
R0171,Both the food and service were outstanding  Enjoyed the visit immensely 
R0171,Bright and spacious   Good selection on the menu   Service excellent and food really tasty
R0171,Brunch was pretty good but everything on the menu is overpriced and service rather poor: long waiting times  rude waiters  etc 
R0171,Buzzy atmosphere  comfortable table  decor over the top  service good  food a disappointment  wine good  value poor iverall  wont be back for dinner  might give it a go for lunch 
R0171,Came here for my sisters birthday brunch  Staff was great  Beautiful restaurant 
R0171,Chaotic and overpriced  Far too busy and noises  Not at all a relaxing experience 
R0171,"Chap on duty had no interest in his work 
His attitude was indifferent   and gave the impression he would rather be anywhere other than in   
We were at least 20 minutes in the restaurant before my wife got her cocktail 
Overall the service was extremely slow 
Too many men in suits rushing around the place trying to look busy 
We will never be back"
R0171,Chic and fun   Great combination   A different choice  including outdoor seating   Service was superb 
R0171,Class  just class  A real 5 star joint but it doesnt come with 5 star prices which is awesome  
R0171,Complained batter on fish was soggy and too thick  Was told that a few people had expressed this and that the chef was experimenting      Was asked if I would like another  I declined  Noone followed up with me  My husband arrived late and settled our bill while I was in the ladies  Didnt want to embarrass our daughter as it was her birthday  Will not return to be experimented on
R0171,Coordination of food coming from the kitchen was poor  Some food was served and we had to wait too long for the remainder of the order to arrive 
R0171,Consistently fantastic experience 
R0171,Cosy seating great service Fabulous food  couldnt fault a thing thank you 
R0171,Decor was nice  Table was too small for our party  the food took a while to arrive and when it did it was cold  restrooms needed attending 
R0171,Decor is fabulous   Food is amazing  Would highly recommend
R0171,"Definitely not what I expect it  Place is beautiful but food was avarage  nothing special  
My partner ordered fish and chips and the fish wasnt fully cooked and you were able to see the raw butter  When the waiter asked if everything was ok  we told him and they did nothing about it  They just sent us the bill like we said nothing  
Very disappointed  wont come back and wont recommend it "
R0171,Definitely recommend  Food was delicious and the service was excellent 
R0171,Delicious and fun   Great service 
R0171,"Delicious food and creative cocktails 
Celebrated our 10 year anniversary and staff took note of this  
Highly recommended for people watching and ambience "
R0171,Delicious food from a great menu  Very friendly and helpful staff  Beautiful decor too
R0171,Delicious food  Coeliac child very well catered for  lovely ambience and waitress  Emily  was exceptional
R0171,Delicious meal  well definitely be back  Thr staff were friendly and attentive 
R0171,Delighted such a vibrant place has opened in Dublin  I have already made 3 more bookings  
R0171,"Dined here yesterday for brunch with my two sisters  on arrival we were greeted by two very welcoming staff members who kindly took our coats and a suitcase for storage 

As we were ten minutes early for our booking we were seated at the bar while waiting on our table  Bar staff were extremely slow and seemed to be preparing drinks for tables rather than people at the bar  Took at least seven minutes to receive a Baileys coffee 

Once table was ready we were seated  Wonderful table to the corner of restaurant  Food was slow to be served but worth waiting for  Two Eggs Benedicts and a Fish cake  each were of exceptional standards and presentation was excellent 

Overall we were disappointed with the experience  no waiting staff checked all was ok with our food  we were not offered any further drinks  dessert menus etc 

Value for money was good but waiting staff need to up their game for returning visits "
R0171,"Disappointing as service was not at a level to be expected for   

Feels like a chain restaurant with staff not being trained to the level of fine dining "
R0171,Disclaimer: This review is not for the food  just the size of the restaurant  It is SO tiny  and seats no more than ten people  We stopped by for a mid week lunch around 1PM and couldnt find a spot  We were disappointed because we had been looking forward to this place for a meal  
R0171,Disgusted that  dont pass on tips given using a credit card to their staff   highly recommend a change to this policy asap    
R0171,The staff wouldnt question the maid service working during the timing of the theft  �The poor response to a customer warrants less than one star if I could give it 
R0171,Dont waste your time  Style over Substance  Less than average food
R0171,Enjoyed a nice evening lovely  meal in cosy corner  place was nice and relaxed but had a bustle to it have recommended it to friends and will go back
R0171,Enjoyed brunch   Decor and ambience lovely  Plan to return early in new year with hubbie
R0171,Erratic service  and  average food  A disappointing evening  I had expectations that were no where near met  And the toilets    need much brighter bulbs 
R0171,Espresso Martinis are fabulous  Food is lovely  a little expensive for evening meal  Brunch is in line with the market
R0171,Everything was perfect from arrival to dining  Gorgeous food and v pleasant staff 
R0171,"Everything was so lovely  Probabaly not the cheapest place but I would highly recommend it if you want to have a special lunch brunch or anything like that

R0171,Fairly disappointed after the much anticipated wait for a booking  Restaurant setting is lovely but thats the only positive I can find  Food is average to poor  does not taste freshly cooked  Service is mediocre  young inexperienced staff  Would recommend spending your money elsewhere 
R0171,Fabulous  I adore the decor  Food very nice  Staff lovely  and  very efficient

R0171,Fantastic staff  amazing food  Couldnt have asked for better
R0171,Fantastic  I had read mixed reviews so wasnt expecting too much food wise  wow  was I wrong  Everything was superb  from the pre dinner drinks  food was seriously delicious  service excellent with complementary tea  and  coffee  lovely touch  Highly recommend  and  so looking forward to going back  great girls night out
R0171,Fantastic  A really fun and buzzy atmosphere  Unpretentious  Gorgeous surroundings  Cant wait to go back 
R0171,Felt very bad for the staff who work so hard   It seems the company is withholding their tips   Seems very unfair 
R0171,"First impressions of  is outstanding the decor is absolutely stunning and the atmosphere is really relaxing  the staff look really efficient and well presented on arrival  
Myself and my mum had the crab linguine which I found really disappointing for a main course as it looked like a starter portion at  Euro 20 It was very expensive for what you get and lacked a lot of flavor with very little crab 
The food was only ""warm "" when it came out which Id say it had been sitting in the kitchen for a good 15 minutes which is pretty crucial timing when it comes to serving food in a restaurant 

I got the chocolate bomb for dessert which was delicious and my mum got ""truffles"" which consisted of a few small truffle balls in a tiny bowl  definitely should not be served as a dessert but more so should be accompanied with tea/coffee 

Overall the experience wasnt bad but id recommend coming back for afternoon tea as it looked much more appealing and the value was very reasonable looking at the price on the menu 

I had also called two weeks prior to booking online to see if I could add one more person to our table  but I was told no as they were fully booked 

Wouldnt recommend it for excellent food but the place itself is stunning  Hopefully in time it will get better "
R0171,First impressions place was lovely but we had a few problems my husband ordered the lobster but then unfortunately it wasnt available the server then suggested the halibut as it was very good so my husband decided to go with that only to be told that their was no halibut 10mins later so went with the salmon but server didnt suggest a side so we thought it came as a whole meal   but when it came it was just salmon and a little veg by then my hubby didnt want to order anything else   then our wine was kept in an ice bucket away from our table and the server was very slow to refill wine glasses my hubby had to get out of his seat to go and refill his wine glass   overall a very disappointing evening for us both
R0171,First time here and i couldnt fault our experience  Staff were so friendly  and the food was out of this world  Ill definietly be back 
R0171,First time to experience and would not hesitate to return  Found the whole experience excellent 
R0171,First visit     it certainly did not disappoint   Top class  
R0171,Food  and  atmosphere fine service terrible   Greeting when arrived less than amicable and table service was poor  Not friendly or inviting 
R0171,Food  and  Staff amazing  atmosphere in there was relaxed  and  really nice  will definitely come back
R0171,"Food average  bar poor 
Beer was not chilled  Irish Coffee very poor for  Euro 11 00"
R0171,Food doesnt live up to the decor  Plates are messy and cluttered   The service was good  If the food doesnt improve this place wont be here in 36 months 
R0171,Food excellent  staff very attentive and good value for money for the standard of food 
R0171,Food good value  Wine very over priced  Staff very efficient 
R0171,Food gorgeous  great service and staff very friendly  Would definitely recommend 
R0171,Food great  atmosphere great  service great  nothing bad to say about it
R0171,Food is average at best  over priced for the food they deliver  however the setting and decor is beautiful 
R0171,Food is mediocre  Service  just ok  Room and light has the wow factor  Recommend if you want a superficial experience  and watch out for the �optional �service charges included in the bill  How much goes to staff   
R0171,Food not great but atmosphere was very good and service was prompt and friendly
R0171,Food ok  drinks expensive and service terrible 
R0171,"Food only average we had the lunch menu and the salmon was very dry and so was the toast  Risotto was quite bland  Overall was disappointed  we were really looking forward to it but didnt reach our expectations    
staff friendly and helpful and the restaurant interior is amazing   May return again but only for drinks  "
R0171,Food terrible service just alright would definitely not go there again
R0171,"Food that we got was nice enough   but nothing special and the menu wasnt really our cup of tea  I think the menu had been reduced from when they initially opened    There were only the 2 of us so not like
we had what they call the ""reduced menu""   Party right beside us with smallies and some were screamers
the whole way through as they passed the baby from one to another   torture   Service was fine   Certainly wouldnt be racing back "
R0171,Food took over a hour to come  then the order was wrong  Overall very bad experience as staff not trained in properly 
R0171,Overall very bad experience as staff not trained in properly Not coming back ever
R0171,Food was awful  Do not waste money here
R0171,Food was awful  
R0171,Food was desperate and came out way too quick for me to believe it was freshly cooked  My steak was full of fatty fibers I couldnt even cut through it  I left half of it behind and the waitress never even noticed  The chips were cooked about 3 times  The lady at the front desk didnt even say goodbye  Desperate will never return 
R0171,Food was disappointing I had a burger and it was dry and lacked flavour  Thought server was awlful very rude  We were asked to leave in 10 mins after we had just finished dessert
R0171,food was delicious  waiter very attentive and friendly   service efficient
R0171,"Food was excellent 
Very disappointing service  we felt we were just forgotten about  food was brought to us when ready  but no one offered us more water   poured wine  asked if everything was OK     and worse for you people no one came back to process bill  after we looked for someone to give it to us  I had to go and find the cash point to pay 
2 ladies on their own  even sitting in good prominent seating  became invisible to the staff "
R0171,Food was excellent  and reasonably priced 
R0171,Food was excellent  service was friendly and extremely helpful
R0171,Food was extremely bland especially the crab linguine  The steak tar tar was smothered in a mustard that ruined the whole taste   
R0171,Noise level so loud we could barely hear each other  Would not return  The steak tar tar was smothered in a mustard that ruined the whole taste   
R0171,Food was fantastic  Service was excellent we were not rushed and were well looked after 
R0171,Food was good service good but not the desert it was very poor  you could have ashtrays outside the restaurant and a proper lift that you do not have to keep your finger noises level high but that is not the restaurants fault  this was the second time booking this restaurant as the first time I booked over the phone I got a call 2 days before going to advise that they doubled booked I said I couldnt due to the fact I organise time from work they said I could re book for another day but I said I would have to check and get back to them they also offered that we could go in the day I initially booked as a walk in customer but would have to wait at the bar and maybe have a drink untill a table is free we did this and 2 hours later still no table so I asked a staff member what the status was and I was advised it could take another hour or more so we left and went elsewhere
R0171,Food was great  but the services was very poor  Over all we waited too long to be served as our waitress tried to blame other staff for his faults  We waited 25 mins for our coffees at the end and only when we asked for them to be canceled and to get our bill  they arrived  Its a very cool and quirky place and food is tasty but only go there if you have time to waste on your hands waiting 
R0171,"Food was just ok 
It was too packed and noisy  
Been asked to leave the table and handed the bill without asking for it was very disappointing  
I will not return"
R0171,Food was lovely but service was very slow  We were served tea  coffee and toast shortly after we ordered but then waited nearly thirty minutes for the breakfasts to arrive  at which stage the toast was long cold and the tea was finished  Luckily we had a lot of chats to catch up on while we waited 
R0171,"Food was nice for most of us  however minute steak was very salty 
Service at the table were great   could not fault  

Front of house staff and bar staff were not at all as helpful  We arrived 5 minutes early for our table  
were told table was not ready and we could sit at bar  No seats at bar  and we had to wait 50 minutes for our table  Drinks were served without mixers we ordered   had to wait 5 minutes to be served again"
R0171,Food was nice quite expensive in relation to quality but decent with good service  All seems a bit pretentious though 
R0171,"Food was nice  however very small portions and service was shocking  Waited 20 minutes for table we had booked very well in advance  no apology from the rude hostess who was very unpleasant and didnt take our jackets unlike was done for other guests  Ordered and ate food and waiter came down gave us bill when we hadnt asked for it and did not ask did we want dessert or teas/coffees  We were not drinking alcohol as I am quite heavily pregnant and feel the waiter was unimpressed by us drinking water  and actually went to take away the jug of water while we were still sitting chatting  Overall we were made feel very unwelcome that we went elsewhere for dessert and coffee 
I have eaten here previously and reception was different when I brought clients in when wearing my work attire  
Very snooty towards myself and my friend and I have already cancelled a client lunch for this week there "
R0171,Food was not great  My husbands steak was nothing special for the price we paid  My cocktail was like a slurpy  We felt rushed when we came in  We wanted to have a drink at the bar but were rushed to seats   Decor is very nice but thats it 
R0171,Food was okay but expected better  In fact I thought it could have been much better for the price  especially the starters  which were not up to standard  The servers were pleasant but they were never around when you needed them  with the drinks and food always out of sync  The place is nice but we had book 4 months in advance  advised it was a birthday  and the table we were given was one of the worst placed in the restaurant  I probably wouldnt return based on that visit  Just a place to be seen more than anything else 
R0171,Food was poor lacked any flavour  Expected alot more and so overpriced  Will not return 
R0171,Food was really good and well presented  service and staff attendance was at the correct level  but must say really love the decor 
R0171,Food was very nice but service was terrible  No teas/coffees even offered with afternoon tea  we had to wait for about 10 mins before we could catch someone to ask  Also no plates brought with it  again had to ask  Also slow to bring the bill and then wait for a member of management to bring the card machine to pay 
R0171,Food was well below average  Both the duck and the chips were well over done  And we felt that as soon as our desert was finished the bill was almost forced upon us as to make the table free even though we were only there an hour 
R0171,Food wasnt very hot and was very average in general  Wouldnt be bothered to go back 
R0171,Food  service and atmosphere top class 
R0171,"Front of house girl was ridiculously poor at her job   She could not find my reservation and I eventually had to show her my email   Then it transpired that my guest had already arrived and been seated at the table   She delayed me for a full 5 minutes at reception making me 5 minutes late for a business meeting   The place was empty and she could have given me any table 

My guest said she had been subjected to the same treatment 

A challenged individual who soured the entire experience 

Then the wait staff said only the manager could the bill payment   not the fault of the wait staff and clearly caused by the well publicized dispute over tips   Another long wait before the manager eventually appeared   not good 

 needs to improve its managers and the front of house person   sooner rather than later   and before it is too late "
R0171,Front of house staff were rude  obnoxious  supercilious  condescending and exceptionally argumentative and insincere 
R0171,From the moment we arrived until we departed we had a fabulous time  The service was excellent as was the food  We cant wait to our next visit 
R0171,From the sincere greeting at the door to the totally professional service which was unhurried but efficient to the excellent food  Faultlessl 
R0171,Front of house staff were rude  obnoxious  supercilious  condescending and exceptionally argumentative and insincere  Very nearly walked out and wont be back because of one individual 
R0171,funky beautiful restaurant with lovely food and friendly service  cocktails are really nice and there is a great atmosphere
R0171,"Given we were early for our booking  We were directed to the bar which was overcrowded  We were overlooked and constantly looking for service  when I showed staff my card for my booking I was told 2 minutes until my table was ready  15 minutes passed until I had to call on service again 

When shown to our seats we were offered normal menus  I had to tell our waiter we were booked in for afternoon tea  We were served our teapots with no tea bags  just hot water  By the time we got our fresh teapots half our meal was consumed  It took so long to get fresh tea 
Overall  we felt a nuisance to staff  the food was delicious but under the circumstances very hard to enjoy  I was hoping my mum  74  would be treated with special attention considering I mentioned it was her birthday   
For first impressions we were left very disappointed with the overall experience "
R0171,Giving service 3  because though there was 3 major mistakes which is not acceptable by any standards  the waiter was  kind and needed a break really badly  The man in suit who brought us chips was very grumpy I am not sure why  The girls at the reception was not friendly either
R0171,Go for some drinks and enjoy the beautiful decor  Avoid the food 
R0171,Good ambience  reasonably priced champagne afternoon tea
R0171,Good but I will hold judgement until I return
R0171,Good experience overall but some of the staff are very unfriendly and it doesnt cost anything to be pleasant and friendly

R0171,Gorgeous meal here and great ambience  Perfect place for a birthday celebration
R0171,Gorgeous place lovely atmosphere food exceptional very tasty waiters and waitresses very attentive will definitely return 5 star experience

R0171,Great value for money  Gorgeous restaurant and bar and great service
R0171,Great value lunch set menu  Food was well presented and very tasty  Service particularly friendly
R0171,Greeted well  Cloakroom is a nice touch  Sat at T48  asked to be moved  Waiter took our food order before our drinks order  Interrupted our food order to take a drinks order  No pleasantries  very dismissive  Food was acceptable  cod  and  vegetables over cooked  Beautiful dessert  brulee  and  bomb  Never offered any further drinks  Had to call waiter back to order coffees with dessert  No up selling from waiter or interaction  Very clean bathrooms  great decor  Staff very stressed  too many staff  not enough workers 
R0171,"Great welcoming   Very polite staff   Food and ambience excellent   Did not remove large plates before last course     aqward    Inattentive to get back to us for the bill   Very friendly/professional otherwise  

 Looking forward to brunch there soon "
R0171,Had a beautiful meal on Sunday The food and service was fantastic Would highly recommend
R0171,"Had a lovely birthday dinner however the whole protest with the menus with details on how the staff are treated really put a dampner on the evening   my guests and I were really confused and then after reading all the info from the protesters were upset we paid our tip on the credit card which our server wouldnt receive 
Waited 3 months for this reservation and just ended awfully "
R0171,Had a great time    Absolutely loved it and cant wait to go back
R0171,Had a really lovely lunch  Beautiful decor and a special word of praise for our waitress  Really enjoyed it
R0171,Had a very lovely lunch service and food was great  
R0171,Had afternoon tea with some friends  It was lovely   beautiful food  and  lots of tea  Would highly recommend it 
R0171,Had another amazing meal here  Great food great service and amazing barmen that make any cocktail you request  Will definitely be back again 
R0171,Had expected really good food based on reviews but was v disappointed with my main course
R0171,Had read some bad reviews but I had a great experience   great menus  prompt service and lovely food and drink 
R0171,Had the early bird menu  I had to return the steak  it was poor quality meat  and  I was not able to eat it  Was so disappointed  Over all the quality of food was the less than acceptable  and  unfortunately I wouldnt recommend the place or return again  Ive previously eaten at  in London  and  its fabulous  ye have have a lot of work to do  
R0171,Had the Tomahawk special to share  It was delicious 
R0171,Have been 3 times now       brunch  dinner and private dining   all very different experiences  Poor dining unfortunately and inattentive service 
R0171,Have been to  many times as you can see from my booking however I have noticed the last few times after and hour and half at table an eagerness to basically get you out  On Friday last we sat at table st 3 45 and at 5 35 were asked if we could take the bill we were still drinking some wine and were just about to order coffee   We made this clear to our waiter who told us we could have coffee at the bar     Not impressed at all and not the first time this has happened  I really dont think I will be returning very poor form it would have taken us 15 mins to have coffee and we were not even given 2 hours on the table  Given the bad publicity over tipping that the restaurant has got recently I feel this was v poor treatment and really not good enough   needless to say I didnt tip     A reply would be nice but I am not sure one will come  
R0171,Have been here a few times now  trying different foods each time and it is always amazing  
R0171,Hello  the overall experience was a bit underwhelming  Our first server  we ended up with two for the evening  was pleasant when we arrived and informed us of the drinks we could have  we were then informed when one of the party ordered a beer that there was none left  For the amount of beer on offer  not much  we found this to be odd  Its a bank holiday weekend and the one selection of beer chosen wasnt available  One of our party then asked for a drink which needed lemon in it and we were told there is no lemon drinks   I found this staggering  Were we just informed incorrectly  If so this is even worse  We eventually settled on a bottle of wine and some gin drinks  The food was fine without being special and for the price of the steak you would expect it to be top of the range  The charging for sauces also is a bit much  The second server we had was very good and pleasant  Overall it wasnt what I was expecting especially for the prices that were being charged and Im sorry to say I wouldnt be rushing back anytime soon Hopefully these comments can help for the future 
R0171,"Hi 

Overall I was a bit disappointed the atmosphere is buzzing and the interior is fab however I was disappointed with the treatments  This is my second time here my first experience we didnt have a nice waitress but I wanted to give it a second chance  The second we sat down on saturday we got the vibe it was like a conveyor belt we received the menus and were within second asked for orders we were reminded on numerous occasions from when we sat down we only had the table for 2 hrs  It was hard to relax as it was like we were being pushed on from the second we arrived  the food on my first experience was nice however om saturday I  ordered the crab linguine and was veru disappointed and left most of it behind  the drinks and the desert were fab  overall I was really saddened by the experience as i went with an open mind after our first experience and really really wanted to be proven wrong "
R0171,"Hi 
I attended last Monday  with some friends  I was really looking forward to rounding off my trip to Dublin in    I live in London so having been to many of  s here I was expecting something similar  what a shame   ����  when I arrived I sat at the bar and ordered a cocktail which was a Gin  and  Tonic with a flower  lovely as it was I choose to go for a normal Bombay gin  and  tonic  I was told there was an issue with the supplier so this was not available   interesting comment from your staff  we were brought to out table and the starters I cant fault all 3 were well presented and tasted lovely  The mains were a little let down  the steak  and  eggs even when asked for medium it was very well over cooked and well done  the fries looked like they had been pre cooked and just left under the pass lamp to keep warm which they were not even warm  when we brought this to the attention of our waitress she needed to get the manager over  who kindly removed this from the bill  over all I the venue is stunning and I really think you need to look at your staffing on a Monday lunch you had more staff in the venue than guests      it was also very visible when you went to the bathroom that more staff were using your private dining room to work from  not a great view if you are trying to sell the room  it wasnt even set up to view  
to say I was disappointed with my visit would be a true reflection  I do wish you the best but I certainly would not recommend you to friends or family in Dublin and I dont think you would be my choice of venue on my next trip "
R0171,Highly recommend  What a wonderful experience  Food was excellent  service was outstanding  Will definitely be back again very soon 
R0171,Honestly could not fault a think from the decor staff food everything was amazing  Cannot wait to go back already
R0171,Horrible    Arrived early to reservation although empty tables made us wait for our reservation time  Arrived at table and sat and sat finally what looked like a manager came took order   No one attended table had to get up and ask for water  They forget my parts of my order  Would never return     
R0171,Hostess not friendly  Waiter real nice but over attentive  Table too small for breakfast items  Coffee bland  Eggs not cooked enough  Sent back and waited 10 mins  whole new breakfast came out with eggs still underdone  opaque  with hollandaise on top  Asked for it without  Toast not toasted   Would not return for food  Decorated real nice though 
R0171,"I am sorry to say we were very disappointed with our lunch   First of all the noise level was dreadful   Bad planning on the lay out    The batter on the fish was most unpleasant   It was a birthday treat for my cousins  both in their seventies  and we gave up trying to talk as we could not hear 
I had booked for dinner on Tuesday for my husbands birthday  but had to cancel because of the noise level   Such a shame  "
R0171,I booked a table for 7pm 25th July so why did you change it to 5pm and then send me an email saying i missed my booking  I have never booked a restaurant for 5pm in my life   VERY UNPROFESSIONAL  Fortunately  this placewere able to accomodate us and I would recommend them but not the app  Avoid   
R0171,I booked a table for 9 30 and I wasnt able to sit down until 9 50  In my opinnion is overpriced for the food quality 
R0171,I booked the restaurant well in advance for family occasion  My family flew from Spain to attend my sons first communion and we went to your restaurant the night before  We booked last sitting at 9 45pm  When we arrived we were told our table was not ready and to wait 5 minutes at the bar  We waited for 35 minutes in the bar  there was not even stools to sit  My mum is 75 and she was not even offered a chair to sit so we all had to stand there for 35 minutes  I was told that customers were not vacating their tables  however I am familiar with your table booking policy  and you are asked to leave the table within a couple of hours frame  I told the manager that it was her job to force the policy and make tables available to customers who have booked in advance  I understand 10 15 minutes delay but it was 40 minutes by the time we sat in our table   By the time we got our food it was nearly 11pm  This ruined completely our mood after standing there for so long  The manager apologised and we got a wine bottle for free when the bill came  But this only happened after I complained energetically  A good restaurant makes tables available to booked customers enforcing booking policies  max  15 minutes delay   offers proactively drinks for free at the bar to customers when they have to deal with delays  without the customer having to complain for this  and deals with necessary diligence with elder customers  you cannot leave a 75 year old lady standing on a corridor without no chair at all because of restaurant delay   Worst experience
R0171,Disastrous customer service experience very unprofessional and absolutely inappropriate for a restaurant at this level 
R0171,We paid an extortionate amount of money for a really poorly served and cooked meal that we had been looking forward to  for a very long time  I cannot describe how disappointed we were  And to be so disappointed on what should have been such a special day makes it so much worse 
R0171,"I booked this resteraunt as a mothers day treat for my mom as we were in Dublin for the weekend  a country she had always wanted to visit and a resteraunt wed heard so many good things about  How disappointed we were  
We had been seated for 25 minutes before anyone came to take our drinks order  and then when we finally ordered the drinks werent very appetising or tasteful   even with the heavy price tag  But we thought to just accept it as we were in a well known place in a capital city and we should make the most of it  
Then came the meals   we had ordered fish and chips  and although the food was presented well  it tasted awful  The fish was very greasy and the chips were over cooked  we attempted to get the attention of any waiting staff but they were so busy running around looking after other people  We attempted to call them over several times but they couldnt hear us over the noise within the resteraunt   loud music and even louder guests  The longer we waited to speak to someone the colder the food was getting  We had picked at our meals  hardly eating any and we eventually decided to just pay the bill and leave "
R0171,I can only speak for the pizza  and being fron New York  �that was the worst pizza I ever had 
R0171,"I dont get why  is so popular  The restaurant is really loud  everyone sits really close to each other  I went to lunch with my friend  we sit next to a couple who are celebrating their anniversary  which should be like a special moment for them  but yet  because we were sit really close to each other  they kinda ruined our lunch  The table was so close like we were sitting in a Starbucks  And because there are tables every where  the restaurant is really loud and people have to speak more loudly to hear what they wanna say  
Also the service is horrible  they charge you service fee without your permission  which supposed to be cool  But the waitress who service our table  I dont know what she is doing  she is keeping ignoring us  every time we want to order something we whether have to shout out loud so she can hear  or just keep watching her till she looks at our table  WHICH NEVER HAPPENED  I dont know what she is doing with her job  She didnt ask me if theres need for coffee or anything after the meal  And if you trying to get something  its take ages for her to fetch 
Also  the food in the restaurant is disgusting  not to mention the steak is so rare like Im eating a beef when they were still alive  They ruined the Creme Brulee  How can a restaurant failed at a Creme Brulee  This is MISSION IMPOSSIBLE  yet  successfully achieved this goal  They made the most disgusting Creme Brulee in my life  The eggnog was so sweet that you will feel like they put the whole pot of sugar in it  also the caramel top is really horrible to taste  for it was sweet around which is cool  but in the middle they put too much fire to it  makes it tastes as bitter as possible 
I guess if theres anything  is okay is the location and decoration  But I will never ever recommend this restaurant to anyone  since theres more cool restaurant with much more better tastes food "
R0171,The food in the restaurant is disgusting  not to mention the steak is so rare like Im eating a beef when they were still alive  
R0171,There was a protest right outside the restaurant which was extremely uncomfortable as placards kept being pressed against the window   We were there to celebrate my daughters confirmation my daughter is 12 and she felt very scared over the protest 
R0171,I felt I was in Paris in the 30s a wonderful night
R0171,I felt sick in the evening after my meal   We also had to wait over a half an hour for our table  
R0171,"I felt that the price paid was very expensive for what was recurved  I had ordered the crab linguine for  Euro 23 and there was 2 crab claws in it  Not a lot  We had to pour our own wine throughout the service and it was placed behind the couch we were sitting on  making it quite difficult to not drip on us  We werent sat opposite each other and that made the table feel quite cramped  I noticed there was a cloak room and yet I had to put my heavy coat on the couch beside us rather than staff ask did I want it hung up for me  

Too expensive for the overall experience "
R0171,"I found the portions very small   
The starter menu was poor"
R0171,"I found the waiters very pushy  for example trying to sell extra drinks onto us as well as various side orders  If people want drinks or side orders they will generally order them without a waitress prompting them to  Asking if we wanted more wine when our glass was still half full 
The food didnt look like it had been prepared fresh and looked like it had been reheated  The curry had a skin forming on top when it was served  The duck leg was quite dry with very little sauce  Portions are very small which was surprising as this venue does not advertise itself as fine dining  Drinks are outrageously over priced  I didnt like to see a waiter rushing an old couple next to us  he brought them their bill without them asking and told them he needed the table back 
Another frustration was that I was told when asked for the early bird menu that they usually stop taking orders for it at 6 15  It clearly states that the menu is available until 6 30
Decor is nice  and the place is well staffed but thats the only positive I can say 
I would not return here or recommend this place to anybody"
R0171,I got the salmon and the asparagus that came with it was barely cooked that is my only complaint
R0171,I had a table booked for 4 30pm  and this was stated on the message I had received the day before that a table would only be held for a certain period of time past 4 30pm   well what about the other way around   we were sat at the bar with about 15 other people waiting for their tables and then only seated at our table at 5 15pm  then was told that we were to give the table back within an hour and a half  service was slow  it was so busy and they were clearly not coping well  It was noisy and chaotic and we had to book weeks in advance to get this table  Not really a good experience and over priced for the type of food and service we had  I dont think i will be back
R0171,"I had a terrible experience here  I met friends for drinks  The barman took one look at me and said he wouldnt serve me  I went outside for a smoke and the doorman wouldnt let me in again  I wasnt allowed to go in an collect any stuff 
I would honestly not recommend this establishment to anyone  Theres plenty of bars nearby  theres no need to go somewhere you may be suddenly be refused admission "
R0171,I wont be rushing back anytime soon
R0171,I had heard a lot of mixed reviews before booking but went ahead and booked to see for myself  I was disappointed with the experience  I wasnt impressed with service  we were left at the table for at least 15 minutes without been asked if we wanted water or a drink and had to call to waiter to place our food order  When the food arrived the starters were ok but Mains was a different story  I ordered a Rib Eye Steak Medium which came well done  by the time I managed to get the attention of the waiter my partner was nearly finished her meal so I wasnt interested in having to wait for another steak to be cooked  for the price of the steak it was also very tin and not very flavorful  it looked like a very cheap cut of meat  
R0171,I had phoned a week earlier to try and change our reservation  The gentleman I spoke to told me he would look into it and call me back  I never received a call back  When I phoned again and spoke with a lady this time she was completely unhelpful and couldnt offer any alternative days or times for that week 
R0171,"I had really high hopes for this place
Service was not great  We did arrive early and the host was pleasant enough but then the server didnt realise we were still waiting on menus and dealt with two other tables that had arrived after us before I got her attention  She didnt realise cos shed only just started her shift  A little bit of better team communication wouldnt go amiss  "
R0171,"I have been to    twice  On both occasions I encountered very poor service  
The first time  they tried to overcharge my group 3 times  By the third time  I asked to see the manager as it was clear this was not by accident 
On the second time  they were extremely slow on a Monday night  The restaurant was not busy and there were lots of staff members  The only explanation is that the staff were talking a lot amongst themselves and were poorly trained 
The food is generally good quality  but as it is one of the most expensive restaurants in Dublin  it is not good value for money 
Finally  I always believe giving a restaurant a second chance  I have for    but wont be going again "
R0171,I have been to a this placea number of times now and have enjoyed the experience but Saturday was a lot different  the service was appalling    Firstly we were told we had the table for 2hrs which is understandable but it was 40 mins before all our party had a drink in hand    2 out of 6 of us ordered starters   only one arrived   we were in the restaurant over an hour and 35 mins before we had our mains but yet we were still told we needed to be out within the time allocated   The food was lovely when it arrived but the service really needs to improve    waiting 40 mins on arrival to a restaurant without a drink when you have a time restriction is not on   After complaining about the time the manager said we could get an extension of 20 mins which was fine so we ordered an after dinner drink but  again one of our parties drinks didnt arrive with the rest   we were asked to pay up even when the drink hadnt arrived    it arrived just as we were leaving   Very poor service 
R0171,I have been to  three times and to date I have not been disappointed  A wonderful experience each time
R0171,I have dined in  on a number of occasions and always had a nice experience   However on this occasion myself and my husband had a received a voucher as a Christmas gift and we decided to take a day off work and go for breakfast   Our bill came to  Euro 36 and we presented our  Euro 50 voucher to the waiter who advised that there would be no credit note for the difference   He gave no explanation for why this is the case and the only option he presented to us was we could purchase something else   As we had already eaten a good breakfast and were sufficiently full this option did not appeal to us   In the end we just paid separately with a card so as not to waste the voucher   I was so disappointed with this response from the restaurant that I have given the voucher away and I will not be going back to     How is this acceptable service in this day 
R0171,Do not go
R0171,"I have to say is it took us over two hours to get our entree do not go
The chicken was dry and cold but since it took two hours were headed to return it unless I am was overcooked and we did return the monkfish look like two small scallops
Tempura shrimp appetizer was quite good I shouldve left after that
The manager came over and almost could not take the lamb off our bill"
R0171,"I just feel there are better places to go without all the hype of     
It was expensive for what we got "
R0171,I liked the decor and the seating arrangements but the music was terrible you could hardly have a conversation  The food was fair would only be back if there was no music or at least softer music 
R0171,I liked the restaurant but the noise level is too high  I also thought the music playing in the background just added to the noise  it had a lot base 
R0171,I made this reservation during our first visit in July  At the time  I requested the table we were sitting at for our Dec 23 pre Xmas meal  Not only did we not get the requested table but front of house staff  useless  made no effort to apologize or provide a similar table  The food is at best  only average  But when ordering the rib eye  at  Euro 33 95  I was told that fries were an xtra  Euro 4 95  Absolute robbery  The ambience of this placeis great and it is a beautiful restaurant but food is   at best  low end gastro pub   Steak was very expensive and not a patch on specialist steak restaurants such as this place who provide complementary fries with Steaks  Very unlikely to be back 
R0171,I ordered a chicken main and the chicken was served uncooked  The waiters were good but too few to provide sufficient service to guests  Very disappointing 
R0171,I really enjoyed the food  We had a lovely time  Staff very friendly 
R0171,I recently dined here with a group of friends  Food was only ok  a steak sandwich made with roast beef and actual frozen berries that my friend couldnt eat for her dessert  The service was also slow and all over the place  Ambience is great though and thats what youre paying for  Would recommend a glass of wine at the bar rather than eating a meal here  Very disappointing after all the hype 
R0171,"I treated my mother to dinner for her birthday at  restaurant on the 10th December 2018  Our booking was for 17:30  
From the moment we were greeted by our waitress Emily G we were uncomfortable as we found her tone and manner very overpowering  She kept insisting that we should have drinks from the bar and we had to keep informing her all we wanted was some water  We had prawn cocktails to start which was very disappointing as what we received was not what was described on the menu  There was no Marie Rose sauce and the majority of the Starter was lettuce and very little prawns 3/4 if I remember correctly  We then ordered the burger for our main courses again very disappointing as it was so basic a bun and a burger and I have actually had nicer burgers in a fast food restaurant  The chips were very greasy  Needless to say we opted No to desert   
I brought our experience to our waitress who was so unprofessional in dealing with my feedback  She told us at the top of her voice there was absolutely nothing she could do with the bill and I explained to her she must have misunderstood me as I was just giving feedback on my experience and never asked for an adjustment to be made on the bill  She made me feel very uncomfortable in front of the other guests around our table giving the impression to others I was looking for something for Free  I am the type of person who gives both positive and negative feedback when necessary   
I would not recommend this restaurant based on my experience and I was so so disappointed that I chose  for my mothers birthday dinner what I thought would have been a lovey experience turned out the opposite "
R0171,I truly enjoyed our first visit   From start to finish it was Fabulous   The Food was amazing and the waiter serving us was excellent  I will definitely be back and highly recommend it 
R0171,"I was a little disappointed with the greeting  we could have been made feel more welcome as paying customers 
We asked for sparkling water and got still water 
The wine when ordered throughout the meal took a long time to be delivered to the table 
I asked for olive oil for the bread and was told they could only provide rapeseed oil  Very disappointed with the experience  The special occasion we went to celebrate  I e a birthday  was not honoured 
My medium rare fillet steak was cooked to a medium temperature "
R0171,"I was at an aviation conference and needed to book a dinner with clients  Being from Dublin  I thought I couldnt go wrong with a restaurant  Especially on the old location  How wrong I could be  The monkfish fish curry was an awful waste of money with about a minuscule amount of monkfish and what seemed to be a whole raw onion roughly �chopped� in the meal  My colleagues and clients were too polite to complain at the time about their shabby meals too  The service could be more attentive for the price that is being paid     my colleagues and I were happier with the Chinese take away while at the conference  I hope you guys change otherwise you wont last long  It was great value and even they didnt last too long  
Cheers "
R0171,I was expecting so much more  Was hugely disappointed  Interior and ambience was nice  I enjoyed that  Just the menu and the quality of the food served up was hugely disappointing  I dont like to give negative reviews  I would have loved to said it was amazing from start to finish  but it wasnt  The food let you down  
R0171,I was here recently with my partner for her birthday and Ive got to say I was really disappointed and the experience ruined our evening  We ordered a medium rare fillet steak but it came well done  so we sent it back and when it came back it was blue/rare  By this point  I had already eaten my meal  which was alright  so it wasnt right for my partner to wait for another steak to be cooked  as Id already finished  Management were unsympathetic  For a meal totalling  Euro 150  the experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth  and Ill not be returning  I understand that not every meal will be perfect and we could deal with that if the situation was handled with a little more finesse  as this was frankly not worth  Euro 150 
R0171,What a poor choice in restaurant   I would advise to avoid this place if you are looking for a good dining experience in Dublin  Would not go back again 
R0171,I was sceptical of attending  on valentines day  As a restaurant owner  I know its a big night and you need reap the rewards  That all said I found the whole meal totally lack luster    I mean it was fine  but nothing I couldnt have been served in a local pub  The steak came on a plate  I wasnt asked if I wanted sauce and when it arrived on the plate with nothing else I was waiting 15 minutes for some sauce to arrive  All this combined with the overpriced bread  extra charges for sauce left me quite disappointed  To be clear I expect to pay for these things but the quality did not live up to expectations 
R0171,I was very disappointed   this was my first visit to the restaurant   I felt the service was below par   our experience was that the staff were very inattentive   
R0171,I felt the service was below par   our experience was that the staff were very inattentive  
R0171,I was very disappointed overall  We were a group of 6 sat at a very large table which made it hard to converse  We requested a vegan menu twice and never got it and it took a half an hour for someone to take our order  One order was wrong which meant by the time it came the rest of us had finished and we didnt get the salt and pepper or sauces we asked for  In the end we felt it wasnt even worth complaining as no one stood still long enough for us to express our disappointment  It was a special occasion which l has invited friends to so it was embarrassing  12 5 percent �optional service charge added to the bill which again I wasnt happy to pay given service was poor but it took so long to catch someone we eventually walked up to the till so we would just pay and leave  Wouldnt recommend it 
R0171,"I was very surprised to get charged for the sauce on my steak  Also chips are extra  
There was a service charge for 2 people on top of our bill  
My husband left a  Euro 20 tip ontop of that hoping thw waiter recieved it"
R0171,I went for brunch with three friends and we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves 
R0171,"I went to here last week and wanted to give it a shot  �I have only ever been here one other time in my entire life  over 18 months ago  and couldnt recall why It was that I only tried it once 

So what is this place  �I would sum it up as a themed fast food  American 1950s styled diner  �Booths  bar stools  juke boxes  lots of chrome accents  �Fast food is a difficult label for it really   a step down from comparable burger places  �Although it would be cheaper from those alternatives 

You can expect overpriced burgers  avg 7 9   shakes  avg 3 4  and fries  3 5 4 5   �Most everything is served al a carte  so before you know it you are walking out spending about 13 15 per person  ouch 

Service is not the quickest but they were friendly enough while we were there "
R0171,I would be willing to give  another chance but my experience was not s good one   We arrived at 9 20 but our main courses were not served until 11pm   I understand something was burnt and we were looked after with a snack   However my biggest disappointment and annoyance and to my companions annoyance was the loud disco music  
R0171,  We could not hear each other and it was not relaxing   I thought it was a shame as I expected music that would go with the decor and feel of the place  
R0171,"I would just like to say how disappointed I was in my dining experience yesterday  We arrived slightly early for our reservation  and  said wed happily have a drink at the bar whilst waiting for our table  Half an hour after our booking time I asked the hostess if our table was ready yet  and  she admitted she was so sorry that shed forgotten we were there  and  waiting 
This would have been an acceptable error but I then received a �No Show� email stating that we had not made our booking  and  to please cancel in future  I again showed this to the hostess  and  she said she would speak to her manager but this was the end of what we heard on this matter  We had expected to see something having been taken off of our bill or for a complementary drink for this but again nothing was said or no apologies made 
Very disappointed in my experience "
R0171,I would recommend for the beautiful stunning ambience but the food is average and doesnt reach the standard of the venue   It is not acceptable that a calice of Prosecco arrived with no showing of the bottle and it was not a good quality 
R0171,"Ive eaten in  several times now since it opened and despite hearing mixed reviews on the food from friends  Ive always enjoyed my meals there so I was really looking forward to spending another evening there with some friends who hadnt been before  Unfortunately on this occasion our meal was definitely average  Three out of 4 of us had the prawn cocktail to start   the lettuce on mine was brown in places and the cocktail sauce was scarce on all so we had to ask for more sauce to be brought  My prawn curry was great however my friends chicken Milanese was slightly soggy  We shared a chocolate bombe between the 4 of us for dessert and this was delicious with the usual theatrical presentation 
Service was good and the atmosphere was buzzy but if this had been my first experience at    Im not so sure Id be going back again any time soon which is a shame 
That said  I will give it another chance to hopefully impress again     "
R0171,Ive never had a bad experience here   this was no different  Always a pleasure
R0171,ideal for an occasion and staff pleasant efficient and very smart
R0171,"If you are coeliac do not visit as there are very poor choices  They are not marked on the menu and you are handed a sheet to try and interpret what you can eat

Loads of staff but service is poor 

Bill was incorrect so make sure you check "
R0171,Incredibly poor service  Servers seemed interested and unhelpful when food needed to be sent back to kitchen 
R0171,Incredible food and service
R0171,Incredible place  It is some experience  Off the charts full stop 
R0171,It had to be the worst   this is my third time here  first was fab second awful  third worse than awful       Staff were oblivious to asking was all ok  Food I had blackened Cod it was disgusting  A pool of water in a soggy leaf and a jelly blob of a teriyaki type guck on top   I got rice and it wouldnt fill a new born puppy never mind a human   My daughter got a rock hard burger and greasy fries   ugh no   not one asked was our meal ok  So I didnt bother to say anything as whats the point   Awful wont be back  
R0171,It had to be the worst   this is my third time here  first was fab second awful  third worse than awful       Staff were oblivious   Awful wont be back  
R0171,"It is a lovely restaurant  design is very good 
Food is     not worth value  Steak is not real steak  
Service is so so    not very friendly  didnt serve water in time "
R0171,It is a fantastic restaurant  the room is truely stunning  and the food and drink was excellent  The staff were really friendly and accommodated out children 3 and 6  I highly recommend this restaurant 
R0171,It is a gorgeous restaurant with excellent food 
R0171,It is a great place to go for a little bit of event dining 
R0171,IT was a special 60th birthday celebration  waited 10 minutes for a waiter  then he disappeared waited another 10 minutes for a different waiter who eventually took the order  Forgot onions for main course for fillet steak  Had spotted 2 junkies sitting on your tables outside no attempt to remove them dispite staff walking past them  Not a very good impression  I am a member of the Garda  While having our main course the same 2 junkies entered the restaurant could not believe how they were allowed enter I   stoped eating my main course and informed a lady manager of staff they were in the restaurant as it was obivious they were going to rob  from a client  Very poor security I thought management would at least come to our table to thank us even offer a complimentry drink  Waiter then forgot my dessert saying he did not hear me ordering one Overall a very disappointing experience to celebrate my 60th birthday as I had recommended  to friends  Perhaps you can respond
R0171,It was a real treat to spend an afternoon here
R0171,"It was a very special day for myself and my partner  as we celebrated our first pregnancy  We booked a table for lunch in   and included a message about said celebration in the notes  

We arrived early  12 45pm 

We were seated 

We were left unattended for 25 minutes  We were not asked if we would like a drink  let alone food 

A couple arrived after us and sat on the table next to us  A man arrived after them and sat at the table on the other side of us  They were both served before us 

Very disappointing "
R0171,It was amazing
R0171,It was my first time in Dublin   amazing service and the food was stunning   My expectations are always low when faced with vegan options but the selection was varied and the food was simply the best I have tasted in a long time   Everybody went out of their way to ensure it was an exceptional experience in every way   Highly recommend it and will be coming back for sure   Keep up the great work 
R0171,It was relaxing and the food was delicious
R0171,It was so nice to have the afternoon tea there  We really enjoyed it  They have the best scones I ever had  Highly recommended 
R0171,It was very busy for a mid week night but food  drinks and service were superb
R0171,Its a nice setting  Food ok but not spectacular  Didnt like cold plates or �compulsory 12 5 percent added on 
R0171,Its was my 4th visit   Amazing as always   Service and food excellent   Staff helpful and always very friendly 
R0171,"Just awful  �Its as if they bought a Thai cookbook and attempted to make recipes from it while having the bare minimum of cooking experience  �We asked if they had Pad See Ewe and the guy had no idea what we were talking about  �Seriously  �

Avoid  avoid  avoid  avoid  avoid "
R0171,Just fabulous  Food and wine excellent in beautiful surroundings
R0171,Love the atmosphere here  Staff and food ten out of ten 
R0171,Loved the decor it was worth going to look at alone  however our side orders were forgotten and there was little compensation  I had to prompt the service staff to offer some good will around this  Two coffees that were not ours were brought to the table and then we were asked to give a tip in cash instead of on our card  Although the service staff were very nice  I felt the overall service let the place down 
R0171,Love the place  staff are wonderful  beautiful place  delicious food  empty plates every time 
R0171,"Love this place
Definitely would return to try more dishes  
Food yummy  and  Cocktails  
Service was well timed and friendly  wines were very affordable"

It was warm and cosy as it was cold outside   Well be back again    "
R0171,Lovely decor  and  ambience  Food was fair  Very noisy  Very attentive staff  Good location 
R0171,Lovely evening but Shepards Pie portion very poor seriously mean a bird would eat more
R0171,Lovely evening  only down side was the fact our booking was at 18:45 however we didnt get seated until after 19:00 
R0171,Lovely dinner
R0171,Lovely evening had by all of us and Ive little treat for my birthday which was not expected x
R0171,Lovely experience fantastic brunch  Chocolate bombe delish
R0171,Lovely experience   looking forward to going again 
R0171,Lovely experience  Prices very reasonable considering the quality and service  Will certainly be back 
R0171,Lovely food and service lovely
R0171,Lovely food and wine list with great Staff   Loved the atmosphere  We went for our sons birthday and we all loved it 
R0171,Lovely food and wine  our waiter was excellent
R0171,Lovely food gorgeous surroundings and good staff  Great experience 
R0171,Lovely place  Both plates of food cold  Coffee cold  Nice place for a drink  Would not rush back to eat

R0171,"Lovely meal  excellent waiter 
All staff very pleasant

Will definitely be back "
R0171,Lovely night  great food and  drink  Service was excellent 
R0171,Lovely night  Lovely staff  efficient friendly and helpful   especially with my friend who has a lupine allergy  Fab atmosphere 
R0171,"Lovely restaurant to check out at least once  
Wayyyyy overpriced 
Couldnt get past how rude  think he was a manager  the French man in the suit was  real shame  Service was very hit  and  miss  Zero interaction with the guests  although the hostesses were beyond lovely  
Wont be running back there  their are plenty of other better places in Dublin to visit "
R0171,Lovely restaurant  disappointing service  manager agreed to remove service charge and provided some complementary drinks so saved the night  Shame as food was very good 
R0171,Lovely restaurant decor  bar and loos too  Fab food and service
R0171,Lovely restaurant  food was great  brilliant atmosphere  
R0171,Lovely restaurant  friendly staff and delicious food
R0171,Lovely Restaurant  great staff  We really enjoyed the experience 
R0171,Lovely Restaurant   Food was amazing from start to finish  Highly recommend 
R0171,Lovely setting  staff very nice but food letsit down  Its just average  Nice to experience once but wouldnt be going back 
R0171,Lovely space and clientele  Service shocking poor from management to table waiting staff  Lack of knowledge of menu clear and we had to ask for our change to the bill more than once  Food and price range good  pity about the fractured service 
R0171,Lovely staff  nice food but the protesting outside and inside ruined our experience  
R0171,Lovely spot in a great location with a super atmosphere  Staff very efficent   Food was very tasty and service was quick 
R0171,Lovely venue for drinks  Food is only average but reasonably priced  Nice cocktails and good atmosphere  Decore is amazing 
R0171,Lovely venue  decor is fabulous  Food and service good too 
R0171,Main courses arrived together but no sides  2 steaks freezing cold  and  one of the sides which had to be returned  Different waiter/waitress throughout evening  Only asked at end of meal how food was  They didnt apologise for bad service  We have dined here before with great service but not this time
R0171,They didnt apologise for bad service  We have dined here before with great service but not this time
R0171,May be nice for post work drinks  The food was mediocre and the waiting staff we encountered werent particularly open or friendly  I had also pre requested a Congratulations dessert which never arrived 
R0171,Mario our server was very attentive to us  great food and lovely setting
R0171,Most glamorous restaurant in Ireland 
R0171,Music too loud  If I wanted to go to nightclub Id go to a nightclub  I can never understand how restaurants can not get this into their heads that music with a meal should create ambiance and be in the background  Its a restaurant the food and service should take centre stage  This is particularly valid with fine dining which  I assume is aiming for given the price point  I should mention the food  and  service were very good 
R0171,My experience of first time at  was very mixed   The front of house staff were lovely  very warm and friendly   The food was okay   nothing exceptional  The service was very mediocre   The waiter was in such a rush he nearly spilt the wine every time he poured and at the end of dinner quickly and rudely took the glasses from the table without asking if we were finished or wanted anything further   What started out as a nice evening   did not finish so well

R0171,My eight time to dine here  and  it was as fabulous as ever 
R0171,My favorite eatery in Ireland  pure class as they would say in Donegal  well done you guys  sublime from start to finish congratulations 
R0171,My fifth visit  Never disappoints  It is the best in Ireland  I will be back again 
R0171,My fourth time  Very hit and miss this occasion   Our waiting staff okay but no rapport with table   Ordered a side of veg which we didnt get  Overcharged for three lunches instead of two  Waitress said computer was �acting up but how did she not notice when she gave me the bill  
R0171,"My friend and I came for lunch at 13 30 
Im home from Abu Dhabi so this was a special occasion 
Salmon was on the lunch menu but when both of us ordered it we were told it was gone   This menu runs until 18 00 apparently but obe main gone bt 13 30  
There was no alternative fish dish offered and no apology given  I was told I could order salmon off the al a carte menu but at full price  so there was salmon available 
I asked to speak to a manager but nobody came  
Not what Id expect from   "
R0171,"My friend and I had breakfast here on a Saturday morning  We asked for still water  twice before we got it and it was sparkling in a still marked bottle 

I opted for pancakes which were nice  but not amazing  There was Greek yogurt between each one and lots on top so they werent pancake like  which is pointless to me when ordering pancakes  The fruit was nice  as was the strawberry sauce but I really could have done with 60 percent less yogurt  My cappuccino was horrible  it tasted like overcooked microwaved milk and the server at the end took it off the bill 

My friend ordered the gluten free apple granola with ginger and cinnamon  The apple was sparse  and the pieces were tiny  she also mentioned the lack of ginger or cinnamon flavour  Her latte wasnt wonderful either  

Perhaps a savoury breakfast would have been a better choice but for me  the breakfast was lacklustre "
R0171,My friends birthday  it was fantastic  Great service and they even brought her out a little sweet treat on the house 
R0171,"My napkin had lipstick on it 
Our white wine was warm 
"
R0171,"Asked the waitress if she has a vegetarian menu and she just said Yes but didnt register I actually wanted to see it and didnt bring it 
Staff were poorly trained and quite indifferent
Toilets were not in a good state and only one tap worked   very ineffectually 
Asked for milk with my pot of coffee and the waiter said It said cream on the menu so why  didnt you ask for milk "
R0171,My second time here  I hoped it would be better than the first  Twenty minutes waiting on our table  Food was cold and the toilets had no toilet paper   again 
R0171,Myself and my partner loved the experience  Food was amazing and the service was fantastic 
R0171,Myself and partner were waiting over 20 mins to be seen to  I actually had to pull the waiter  We were not told the special just given the menu  The soup was beautiful but steak was not I had a butter knife to cut  no sauces nor were they offered but the couples on both sides of us were offered specials and had an attentive waitress  I wouldnt be rushing to go back  I had high expectations but it was such a let down
R0171,Nice decor  however the table setup was disappointing  Food average and service not attentive and slow 
R0171,Nice decor and setting  food although tasty   it is small in portion size 
R0171,Nice interior but not worth suffering poor quality food  Scallop starter was over cooked on a bed of dried out peas   Yellow fin tuna was just acceptable  Sirloin steak was ok but  Euro 4 for bearnaise sauce 
R0171,Nice room but food is below average  We had lunch and were served very quickly  looked like food was plated and kept warm  barely   Not the experience we had expected 
R0171,Nice setting over priced for food   Food was good  Wait staff were very good 
R0171,No childrens menu which is ok except made no effort to accommodate  17 euro for a plain burger and chips   Took the shine off a lovely meal
R0171,No one in the restaurants  but order was wrong in any case  Didnt bother to  mention it  Sine when are fresh jucices out of a tretapack� No more visits by me
R0171,"nobody seems to be in charge   requests had to be submitted several times  The younger waiting staff were very pleasant but did not seem to be getting any direction  and their did not seem to be much communication between the various functions  Noise control is good  there is a buzzy atmosphere but the place seems more of a ""destination"" rather than a well run restaurant  The reservation system also seems to be crazy "
R0171,Nope  coffee was still terrible 
R0171,"Not a patch on any of the other this placerestaurants 
Went here for a birthday dinner at the weekend and was put off going again  Firstly tables are way too close together  you should not be able to hear conversation from two tables down  Initially the girl serving us had a major chip on her shoulder and everything seemed like a big ask  We both ordered fillet steaks for main and there was such flourish in serving the food it was a disappointment that they mixed up our plates  easily done I know but still annoying given what youre paying for  When I mentioned the steak to the server she was very apologetic  Overall  the food was good and presentation was nice we had prawns and duck salad for starters and fillet steaks for main  I dont think the restaurant lives up to  name in any way  I know this is meant to be more casual but there is no target market at all  People in football jerseys  buggies parked inside the door  very noisy  Its still early days but itll be quite a while before I return"
R0171,"Not at all happy with service  girls ordered full irish breakfast and toast came out 20 minutes prior to the rest of their meals  I had eggs benedict which was cold  Not great food even if it were served hot  not worth the wait or the hype  
On a positive note the bathrooms were lovely  but management need to focus less on the surroundings and more on the food "
R0171,Not just the meat but the whole burrito was dry   
R0171,Not long open but can already see standards starting to slip  which is disappointing
R0171,Not what Id expected  No cloakroom service and all guests were seated close together in front section trying to manage bags and jackets around table despite rest of restaurant bring relatively empty  Seated 10 mins early and ordered but took 40 mins for starter to be served  Food was nice but lacked seasoning and and portions were rather small  Side of chips were overcooked and several had black spots  Staff polite and friendly  Discretionary optional service is neither discretionary nor optional when it is already included in bill when presented at the table   Why ask during booking if this was a special occasion and then do nothing about it  Missing wow factor and not a place Id be interested in returning too 
R0171,Nothing outstanding  you pay for the name  Service charge will go to the company if you do not ask for it to be removed  you can then tip your waiter rather than the company 
R0171,Old friends meeting up we had a lovely evening  Highlight was the chocolate bomb dessert  We will be back 
R0171,On arrival  9 45 am for breakfast  the receptionist was busy with what looked like a delivery man  no welcome greeting or acknowledgement and ignored our party of 4  The reception area is grubby with a broken mirror on reception desk and the floor littered with dirt and looked like it hasnt been hoovered in an age  Food  we all thought the food and coffee was delivered lukewarm/cold   Full Breakfast: the sausage was an English style sausage and to my horror no real butter but a margarine type spread for the toast   The Service was acceptable  
R0171,The Service was acceptable  
R0171,On our visit we found the staff extremely rude unhelpful on the night   Food was very average this visit   Would not return or recommend to friends in this occasion
R0171,On waiting for my change to arrive  I was told I wasnt owed any change as the waiter believed I had handed in a  Euro 20 note along with a gift voucher  when in fact I had handed in a  Euro 50 note and gift voucher  When I explained I had in fact handed in a  Euro 50 note  the waiter said he would have to check the cameras  The supervisor returned some time later with the change  I was mortified and made out to be a liar by the waiter  Awful experience and wont be returning due to this  Handled unprofessionally 
R0171,One of the few restaurants Ive ever seen in Dublin with a service charge 
R0171,One of the most beautiful interiors matched by fantastic food  Could not fault any part of my experience here  cant wait to go back 
R0171,"Our aperitifs arrived before our starters  The starters were bland  the prawns didnt taste fresh and the Arancini were over cooked and therefor dry  The mashed potatoes were swimming in olive oil and the steak with pepper sauce arrived without the pepper sauce   it took a further 15 minutes for the sauce to arrive  As for the chocolate bomb for dessert it was in fact a caramel dessert by the time the waitress finished with it  My wife is in fact a lovely lady however it was not necessary for the waitress to refer to her as such for the evening  At the start of the night we were lamenting the two hour limit for dining   in the end we ate three courses and beat that time by more than 30 minutes   a truly miserable experience  

This is in fact the first time we have ever felt strongly enough to post a negative review for anything "
R0171,Our booking was for 9:30 on Saturday night   upon arriving we were informed our table was not ready and were directed to the bar where there was no space to even stand or put our coats at first   We eventually squeezed into a space and after 15 mins we finally got the attention of one of the bar men to order some drinks  At 10 I went back to the desk to inquire about our table   now half and hour late to seat us  The hostess did not seem at all apologetic and simply told me that it would be another 5 mins  15 minutes later my friend approached the desk  again asking when our table would be ready and she was told that they were finding it difficult to remove the guests that had been seated for the earlier sitting  We finally got to our table at 10:25pm   almost one hour after our booking  which had been booked last December     The manager did come over at that stage apologised and offered us a bottle of prosseco to make amends  which was nice  We ordered immediately as the waiter had told us the kitchen usually closes at 10:30pm   Our nibbles arrived almost immediately which was great  but out of the four starter ordered  one did not arrive until 20 minutes after the rest of us were served which was disappointing  Our waiter was lovely and could not have been more helpful or apologetic for all the mishaps  but I think the overall management of booking etc needs a serious review  This experience would not deter me from visiting again  as the food was good and the venue is stunning  Hopefully they will read the reviews  as there seems to be a common thread in many of them  take the feedback on board and improve on the issues raised 
R0171,"Our experience was poor this time 
I asked the receptionists how far to Bord Gais which sshe said she did not know instead Of � I do not know but will check  for you �  I may have asked the second girl at the reception and I got no answer from her  as well
The same happened when I asked the server before we sat at our table 

My husband had prawn cocktail starter and when no brown bread was served with it I asked for bread
Thinking it was standard and when  served the bread not realizing the price of 4 50 till we got bill so for I piece of bread  we paid  4 50  
the server could have said there is a cost of 4 50 then we could have decided whether that was reasonable for 1 piece of bread 
I had a problem with the fries to which the server offered to change straight away as I felt they were there a while and very dry  but the others were the same so that is your fries are done which is fine and she was very nice about it and kept offering something else
I was a bit disappointed at this stage as I felt  still annoyed from when I first came  but that was not the servers fault 
Finally upon leaving your restaurant 
I asked receptionist on way out about the  charge  on the bread  and she could not tell me and had to find menu to check to which I then saw it 
then I asked her where I could get a taxi to which she said turn right it was actually turn left and again no offer  to call us one or show us where

Working in the tourism industry I felt each of the questions I asked could have been answered with a simple � I do not know but I will check � 
I left your restaurant that night annoyed over the way I believe we dealt with on simple questions 
I suppose it is Murphys law where one item went wrong 5 more  followed

Anyway just my opinion on the night
I am not sure would I return to you again"
R0171,Our first time and it certainly lived up to our expectations  Stunning decor  lovely ambience   excellent staff  and  service and lovely food  Surprise  lovely touch by giving us a small celebratory dessert for our anniversary  Will definitely be back  highly recommended 
R0171,Our server had a very bad attitude  It was like we were putting her out and we had no special requirements or requests 
R0171,Our server was very rude and unfriendly  food was lovely  ambiance was very nice  But overall experience was bad
R0171,Our server was unbelievably attentive and the decor was stunning 
R0171,"Our service was poor  the waiter a bit rude and unattentive  drink server came once and never again and unfortunately we also had a very loud group celebrating next to us leading to not a great evening   
Food was good but not the same quality as other this placerestaurants I have dined in "
R0171,Our table was far too small for our group of five people  By the time all the food had arrived  there wasnt enough room left on the table for all of our drinks and sides  We complained but were told that these tables were for five people
R0171,Our table was not well attended
R0171,Our table was not well attended to at all ok any way
R0171,"Our table was right near the staffs station and as such the staff gathered around it all the time  We could hear what they were talking about and felt almost judged and looked at at times  There was a lot of staff and some of them looked annoyed to be there  
Overall the food was good  the restaurant itself is beautiful but we would have had a better time if we were maybe placed in a different area "
R0171,Our third visit we found the staff extremely rude unhelpful on the night   Food was very average this visit   Would not return or recommend to friends in this occasion
R0171,Our trip to  was very much looked forward too and upon arrival we were not disappointed  The atmosphere  staff at the door and bar were stunning  The cocktails are a must and were delicious  unfortunately that was all the highlights for us as the food was just ok and our waitress did not crack a smile once until we were paying the bill and then was very friendly  Bit of a shame as the surroundings and reception is stunning 
R0171,Outstanding dining experience  Great vibe  Highly recommend 
R0171,Outstanding food place and waiter
R0171,"Outstanding food  
Exceptional service  
Fun atmosphere  overall a brilliant dining experience "
R0171,Outstanding restaurant   Amazing service and food 
R0171,Outstanding service  tasty food and lovely cocktails  We had a great time here  Definitely recommend it
R0171,Over priced pub grub  Charge you for everything  Even had to pay  Euro 3 50 for sauce on my over priced fatty steak  Would not recommend  at all 
R0171,"A little bit disappointed with the service  The host was slightly rude and not welcoming  The same girl was at the door when we left  never said Thank you or Goodbye  A good save from a most gracious young man with glasses  The waiter at first was amazing however as the evening went on we felt the level of service dropped drastically  It went from warm  and  friendly to barely being noticed which was quiet frustrating  
In fairness there wasnt many tables when we arrived and he got busier but again no Thanks or goodbye "
R0171,Overall our dining experience  at a cost of c Euro 100     was disappointing  My prawn cocktail starter was terrible with very few prawns and sauce  but piles of stale discoloured  lettuce bits  I complained to the waitress and she agreed not to charge for it but when the bill arrived it was included  Our 2 glasses of wine arrived and they contained very little wine  My main course was steak  eggs and chips    the steak was very tough and the chips amounted to only 10 in number  We had a gift voucher for  Euro 100 but our bill amounted to less than that  The waitress stated that we could not pay the gratuity with the remaiing amount as the restaurant kept the difference for themselves        Overall Not a very enjoyable first time in       may be our last                  
R0171,Overall the bar decor is gorgeous  the cocktails and food were nice but we were left at the bar for over 45mins and we noticed another group of 4 come in after us and get seated  I had to remind front desk that we had been waiting and then was seated as they had forgotten us  The service was very slow for cocktails and food and had to request the bill at the end of the night twice  Would not return again until the service improved  Very dissapointing as the table had been booked a month in advance as it was a special evening for our group 
R0171,Overall we were disappointed  Food was okay but not as good as we had hoped  Service was not great  The waitress was barely polite and certainly was not happy in her job  We had to wait a ridiculous amount of time to get our bill due to the policy of waiting staff not being able to handle the payment  Unacceptable in my view  The guy who eventually  sorted our bill did not make eye contact  did not ask how our meal was  first time there  and did not apologise for the delay  Lovely place and setting but we will not be back for dinner  Too many nice places in Dublin with better service and staff who seem to like their work 
R0171,"Overpriced and pretentious  The food was fine but certainly not memorable and at  Euro 13 for a starter it needs to be  Staff were complacent at best  
While it was not horrible I certainly would not recommend or revisit in a hurry "
R0171,I ordered prawn and avocado burger was like a patty mush inside a bap when I looked at it all broken  The service was poor we were in the waitresses eyeline and she kept walking past us the staff are very good at appearing busy  Had to ask for the table to be cleared and dessert menu  3rd time here and no better 
R0171,Overpriced ordinary food  We were a party of 5 table was too small unable to hold food plates and glasses  
R0171,"Overpriced  
The venue itself its lovely  beautiful decor  However  the portions are very small  I ordered the warm chicken salad for mains  which indeed had chicken but no salad  No leaves  no tomato or cucumber  It was no where near filling and barely the size of a starter 
Dessert was lovely but for  Euro 9 75 it would want to be 
The manager hovered and whipped away plates without asking if we were finished  
I came away hungry "
R0171,Perfect for a special occasion  Decor and ambiance great  Amazing food at great value  Very attentive and polite staff  Will definitely return 
R0171,Perfect  Spacious  Beautiful  warm decor and a welcome gem in the city 
R0171,Pierre our waiter was wonderful and so accommodating   very handsome also  
R0171,Place is beautiful  Food is delicious  Staff are very efficient  Perfect for breakfast  brunch or dinner 
R0171,Pleasant atmosphere  Fresh Food  The afternoon tea was superb
R0171,Please improve your wine list include a good red and white wine for around  Euro 40 the wine list is disappointing anything decent is over priced
R0171,Poor quality food stale uninspiring  poor fish and chips not fresh v heavy batter  Warm chicken salad v greasy  Had various meals over the last few months started off well gone down hill  Service needs to be sharpened up too 
R0171,"Poor service and attention to detail  not enough glasses put out for the correct number of people or cutlery  
Service was slow when something was requested  eg drink"
R0171,Poor service from senior management who could/would not accommodate us because of a food intolerance issue for one in our group  It made the person so uncomfortable  and  embarrassed  and  it was her birthday too   The  senior manager was obviously untrained to deal with issues like this  We had to leave and go elsewhere  So disappointed 
R0171,Poor service  Bottle of wine not kept on table  and  had to call someone each time to have it brought over to be refilled  Food   tiny portions  Cod gougons  2 only  mainly batter  Chips overdone   Under  pressure to watch clock to leave within the 2 hour slot 
R0171,Poor service  Tried to charge us for drinks we never ordered  Mixed up my order waiting 30mins for my desert while everyone else had theres  Chips horrendous   Tasted like frozen McCains chips  No soap in soap dispenser  Empty loo rolls in toilets  Expected more from   
R0171,Poor service    Told on arrival we had to leave at 8:30  2 hour time  slot  even though table wasnt ready and we were told to wait at the bar for 15mins  then staff didnt take order for 35mins  Wine placed 10m away in a cooler  We ordered tea for my grandad 83 at the start of the meal  didnt come  we ordered again when starters arrived  didnt come  we ordered again twice at dessert and had to wait 20mins until desert finished when 3 pots of tea came out  Staff all over the place and the cheek of them to have mandatory service on 4 guest and over  Avoid if you want a proper dinning experience  Service is mediocre at best and you would get better in pub/cafe  Very disappointing 
R0171,Pricey enough meal for average fare at best  Service was lacking as well  possibly initial teething problems but simple points need to be sorted asap   e g  not enough wine glasses  or left standing at the bar for c 25mins after our reservation time 
R0171,Quite a disappointing experience really  As regulars at the original this placein London  we decided to give the Dublin branch a try during a birthday trip  Predictably  we were seated pretty close to other diners despite the oodles of available spaces  I understand this is convenient for staff  but it actually means you can hear other peoples conversations  and they yours  so as paying customers it is frankly very annoying that this �exclusive brand has followed suit of other chains such as Pizza Hut      Our waitress was less than attentive  She spilled water all over our table twice and did t offer to clean it up  She walked away mid order and had to be called back  and didnt seem at al interested in monitoring her diners comfort  My food was nice but cold  and my friends was also cold but soggy and lacking flavour  She left most of it  yet the waitress didnt seem to think to question this  Id mentioned my friends birthday on the reservation hoping there might be some acknowledgement to make the experience more memorable  however it was a last minute afterthought when she dumped a tiny  I mean  REALLY tiny  little tart on the table as we were about to leave  It was less than personal  and clearly one of a big batch that was probably defrosted that morning  Come on  try harder   diners have a choice 
R0171,Quite disappointed by the afternoon tea service  no tablecloth  had to go  and  ask for plates as none were brought when the food arrived  Had to ask for spoons for one of the desserts which was in a pot  Asked for fresh tea and it never arrived  Really poor  and  not what youd expect from   
R0171,Rare steak ordered with a well done steak as main course  Well done was ok barely warm   rare came well done and was cold   Sent it back   No apology  No recognition that when it did arrive the other 3 guests had finished their meal   Wine waiter mixed next tables white wine in glass of one of our guests   no compensation 
R0171,Really awesome place  Different atmosphere from any Ive been before  Food was delicious and service was exceptional 
R0171,Really enjoyable experience  Great food and excellent staff  Would definitely recommend 
R0171,Really enjoyed food and service was excellent  Will definitely return 
R0171,Really enjoyed it  Food was fantastic  service was great also  Music was a bit loud for a Saturday afternoon but still loved it 
R0171,Really enjoyed my experience  Food was one of the best breakfast I ever had 
R0171,Really enjoyed our evening  Very attentive service and the food was lovely
R0171,Really enjoyed the brunch there with my friend  The food was nice and I had the best tea in Dublin there 
R0171,Really enjoyed the food and cocktails and atmosphere   lots of choice and not too expensive   I will be back
R0171,Really excellent place for a weekend brunch   Chicken Milanese was especially good 
R0171,Really excellent  The food is superb  with great service  The steaks are amazing  The decor is great  I love the atmosphere 
R0171,"Really loved
The service excellent and the ambience fab "
R0171,Really nice  
R0171,Really nice atmosphere and great food and drink  ok to pay a little extra for that
R0171,Really nice  Had the early bird  Great value  Would recommend
R0171,Really relaxing place for a get together  Tables arent on top of each other so we felt very comfortable  Food was lovely  Would definitely go again 
R0171,Reception staff not very welcoming  Waiting staff needs to learn 
R0171,Recommend for sure   I was in Dublin for 10 days and ate here twice 
R0171,Relaxed atmosphere Good menu  friendly staff   lovely food served piping hot a great venue to see and be seen
R0171,"Requested steak very well done
When it arrived firstly it was cold and we had to send it back
Then the second one was cooked medium well 
We brought this to the attention of our very nice waiter 
We were charged full price for the steak which we were very disappointed with"
R0171,"Restaurant was beautiful Staff were very friendly and very professional  food was average nothing special and very over priced
Would not return based on quality of food and price"
R0171,Room was bit cold  Myself and my son had to leave our coats on     Husband was coeliac and the waiter hadnt a clue about gluten free  not one menu    brought out separate sheets about intolerances and he was trying to figure them out    everything we asked he checked the sheet and he kept saying no it was not gluten free  so we asked him what could my husband eat  he didnt seem to know  his english was bad was hard to understand him    I then asked him could he check with the chef if my husband could have soup and salmon  he went off and he  was chatting to other waiters and nobody seem to have a clue   He then came back few mins later and said that would be ok    Soup wasnt that hot bit spice but was ok   bread is not included with the soup   Main courses burgers was terrible  far too much meat  couldnt eat mine    Daughters fish  and  chips just ok  fish not fully cooked    My husbands and mams salmon was ok  not much veg  tiny bit of broccolli   He said mash potatoes were very oily so we asked could we have plain mash  he said no   We had chips instead which were nice    We asked waiter if chips were gluten free  meaning were they cooked in separate oil  he didnt understand  came back and said chips ok   my husband wasnt too well next morning  so there was definitely some gluten in his meal somewhere     We were originally going to have dessert but opted against as per experience of mains and starters   House red wine was nice and cost e28 which was good value for city centre restarant    Because 5 of us charged service charge so had no option whether to leave a tip or not    Waiter was from Italy  knew nothing about gluten free  hard to understand but  he was very pleasant and nice and tried his best   Separate person came over to collect bill just about asked us was meal ok  wasnt really that bothered   |Very impersonal someone separate coming to table to get payment   Overall we will never go back to this place in Dublin and will not be recommending to anyone either 
R0171,Rude staff from time we arrived to when we left ruined a nice lunch unfortunately 
R0171,"Sadly our review is as follows:
1   Regrettably our expressed wish for a window table could not be granted 
2   The lamb dish was poor as the meat was tough while the filet steak was very good 
3   Payment of a suppliment for the sauce accompanying the steak reflects a mean attitude towards customers   
4   Service was well below the standard of what the restaurant seems to aspire to 
5   Would not recommend the restaurant 
6   Since our visit and having expressed these sentiments to people it seems that we are not alone "
R0171,Saw Male staff member at door   in my opinion  be slightly rude to another customer  She was asking for her coat and he dismissed her in a curt manner saying he had another customer to look after  he did it in front of others   Then  while some of the waiters at our table were nice  one seemed rushed and it bordered on being brusque  wonder if its a thing in this restaurant  that customers are a bit bothersome to the staff   Also we ordered bottle of water with our order but it didnt arrive so had to ask a second time    Food lovely and lovely surroundings but customer service needs a a brush up 
R0171,Second time at  since it opened   great atmosphere and decor  unfortunately the food and service do not match the atmosphere   I had the lamb main and asked for it pink   it arrived well done with not a hint of pink  It was served on a bed of mash with steamed vegetables which were undercooked and crunchy  All in all a very disappointing main   a poor carvery lamb dish  From a service perspective  the side for my main dish never arrived and by the time I was able to get the attention of a waiter to make them aware I was almost finished my main so there was no point  there was not much of an apology forthcoming either which was disappointing  Having eaten in the original this placeand the new offshoots in London over the past few years  of unfortunately this benchmarks poorly from a service perspective
R0171,Second time and as excellent as ever  Delicious food  great service and a beautiful looking restaurant 
R0171,second time here and a real disappointment  Food  Sole  at  Euro 42  was average  staff not trained  Sourdough not fully baked  waiter not surprised more or less told us problem before we said anything   All in all very average 
R0171,"Second visit  Fabulous  Fabulous  Fabulous 
Going again tomorrow night "
R0171,"See my review
First class in all sectors  good spot for a party  "
R0171,Served both courses within 30 mins  really rushed  we went outside for a cigarette after our main and told the waitress we were doing so  our drinks and coats were still at the table and when we came bk there was 5 people sitting at our table  Total joke 
R0171,"Service at the bar was a little slow and it proved hard to catch a staff members attention 

When we were seated our table was in the corner and the air conditioning was freezing   myself and my friend both had to wear wraps throughout the meal which luckily we had with us and my husband put his scarf over his legs as was draughty and cold  He is sniffling this morning and seems to have picked up a cold as a result 

Despite the diverse menu   unfortunately there was a limited selection of the food we wanted available   there was no fillet steak available and when we ordered fish and chips as a second choice our waitress returned to advise there was no fish and chips available either 

The setting itself was lovely and the food that we did get was very nice"
R0171,Service at the door was slow and unfriendly  No option of seating was given and there was plenty of empty tables  Toast carrier was dirty  Poached eggs were under cooked and sausages were nothing short of disgusting  We had rang and asked for an extra table for friends to join us but were told it was completely booked out which was completely untrue as there were plenty of empty tables for the full time we were there and walk ins were being taken at the door  Very disappointed would not recommend or return 
R0171,Service on our table was extremely poor and slow all table covered by same waitor seemed to have similiar experience  The waitor seemed to care more about walking around and talking to other staff members than serving our table  Was extremely slow to approach table to take order and clear table after food never offered if we wanted desert menu meanwhile a table beside us served by a different waitor came in half an hour after us were served and received main course and desssert and paid before we had to ask for a dessert menu  Very very disapointed with service 
R0171,"Service poor attention to detail poor staff unfriendly especially the girl who seated us   
"
R0171,"Service poor attention to detail poor staff unfriendly especially the girl who seated us   
Over all we found this restrant to be over hyped too crowded and especially  not value for money   Very Dissatisfied"
R0171,Service poor  food average  A lovely venue but a bit of a case of style over substance   A lot of staff on  but we found it hard to drag them away from chatting to each other to get any service 
R0171,Service poor  Being rushed from the table before a 2 hour slot after been 30 mins waiting on our table although we arrived on time  The server to interested in tip watching  Food lower standard compared to  across the UK 
R0171,"Service very poor 
Wine server appalling  pouring wine into already overfilled glasses   "
R0171,Service very slow  Food only very average  Cheeseboard was the best part off the three course meal 
R0171,Service was appalling  we were given wine from another tables  dirty glass at one point and no apology  In a section of 6 tables theres was audible complaints from each party
R0171,Service was excellent  food was excellent  consistent every time weve gone 
R0171,Service was good  place is obviously beautiful but the food is rather poor    a very safe menu  flavorless at times  prawn and cod curry defo a poor choice  and below expectations  Id not recommend it for its food   
R0171,Service was not what we expected from    We had brought two overseas visitors to the restaurant and one of them actually told the waiter we were not being looked after   Service was slow and we had to ask twice for a second bottle of wine  
R0171,Service was pleasant and professional but very slow for a lunchtime  particularly when ordering from a set menu 
R0171,Service was really bad on my 2nd outing for mothers birthday  Constantly had to keep asking for out drinks and the bill just never arrived  Food wasnt as good as the first time I was here in the summer  my meat was cold and personally asked for a happy birthday dessert which never came  Shame 
R0171,Service was terrible   Side order didnt arrive  no apology and then they had it on the bill  2nd time there  service equally as bad both times  wont be back   
R0171,Service was very poor overall 
R0171,Service was very poor overall  Waited 30 mins or so for 4 standard egg breakfast dishes  My friend was advised there was no almond milk  only skimmed milk then another waitress advised they had almond milk but no skimmed milk  Disappointed overal and wouldnt be in a rush back or in a rush to recommend to a friend 
R0171,"Service  food and ambiance was  perfect 
Thank you"
R0171,Shepards Pie portion very poor seriously mean a bird would eat more
R0171,"So disappointed by food  asked how we wanted steak cooked  asked pink was not one bit pink  My chicken dinner sounded amazing but was NOT in taste and look   Have had  better bar food or brunch around Dublin  and not as pricey as here   Yes the decor is fab  thats about it   felt lots of staff   looked like managers   doing nothing bar hold clip boards  
Disappointed as it was my birthday weekend  not be rushing back  "
R0171,So dissapointing   The prawn starter was watery and tasteless   My sea bass was lacking in flavour   was not rubbery in texture and over cooked   My husband had the special fish of the day Dover sole which was a tough as an old boot   The apple tart for dessert was good   Wont be back  
R0171,"Sour dough bread in a loaf size with tiny pattie of buttet  starter of crispy duck should have read ""greasy duck skin only "" chips with main had been re cooked   burgar fine  wine bottle moved around restaurant and finally had to get up get it ourselves when glasses empty   Not a patch on the quality of the Ivey London   you need to do So much better "
R0171,"Special family occasion booked on line 3 people got a few texts and emails reminding of date and time but it was nearly over the top 
We arrived on time and showed to table no problem over server was very nice friendly and attentive but perhaps lacking experience 
We ordered a pre lunch drink two arrived nearly immediately but the third drink was at least 5/7 mins behind while waiting our food order was taken and our starter immediately as soon as we got the third drink which was a gin and tonic 
We ordered white wine not a expensive bottle I think it was one of you house ones I tasted it and it was warm I said I would like it a little cooler and they brought a ice bucket this was placed away from the table it had very little ice in it and it took some time to pull the temperature down to a acceptable level we had to pour the wine overselves which I didnt have a problem with but after we had a glass each they were very quick to pour more to try and sell us another bottle 
The food overall was good but my mashed potatoes were cold as where my wifes chips we asked to have hot potatoes and chips but by the time they arrived we were neary finished the meal my wifes chips were only a little hotter than the first lot but both portions were terrible cooked and reheated 
We paid our bill  and decided we wont go back not a great experience it wasnt a expensive but thats not the point"
R0171,Special place  Food  service and ambience were wonderful 
R0171,Spent a really enjoyable bday brunch on Sunday with my sisters  loved my mini cake n candle thanks so much  
R0171,Staff and service were very friendly and efficient   Food however was far from up to scratch   Hair found in batter of tempura prawns   when we notified a staff member they were very apologetic and took it off the bill   Overall the food was very poor  dry lamb  tasteless crab    I have eaten in  tower bridge in London but  Dublin has a long way to go to improve   Food does not reflect price paid either  
R0171,Staff need to pay more attention to detail they seem to be to busy chatting amongst them selves if something is  missing from your order you have to try get the attention of one of them same if you want something else 
R0171,Staff lovely and friendly  Breakfast was lovely   Definitely recommend
R0171,Staff not at all friendly   would go to say had pusses on their faces  Food was nice but dont think we will be going back
R0171,Staff were cold and distant
R0171,"Standard of Food was disappointing  
Dressing with Tempura Prawns was bland and chips with main meal had been cooked twice 
Tables too close together "
R0171,"Started at the front door 
The concierge was way too far up her own a** forgetting that the customer is the focus not herself
Room is very nice and seats were good
Service left a lot to be desired
No Salt and Pepper on the table
Too many glasses to start
We had to ask the staff to clear empty plates and glasses off our table a couple of times
White wine was not chilled enough and the wine glasses themselves looked like buckets   no stem to hold and keep the already warm wine cool 
Staff more in to the image of working in  rather than ensuring the customer has an unforgettable dining experience
Needs a good shake up
Not a patch on Marco Pierre White across the road
I have dined in  in London and it was fab  this place  is no where near London standards
Would not recommend this restaurant way too expensive for what you get "
R0171,Steak sent back because u know what the chef does not understand a simple request   Well done  rest my case      
R0171,Stunning decor but average food and a waiter that was nice but clearly tired/out the night before and we had to look for his attention for a few minutes every time we needed him  There was no iced tea left   which leaves limited options for non alcoholic drinkers  Two of us had the crab linguine which was fine but nothing special and wasnt that warm  My friend had the Seabass curry which was definitely nicer  I think the Restaurant will need to up their food game to keep numbers coming through the door once the inital buzz fades   
R0171,"Stunning setting  great atmosphere  Had really high hopes for a lovely meal  but the food was only average   Was extremely disappointed   Hosts at the door were lovely  warm and welcoming   Waiter was ok 
We booked when the online bookings opened  for our anniversary 
Wouldnt be rushing back to eat  Bar looks stunning for cocktails though 
Overall disappointing experience "
R0171,Such a stunning restaurant and great food  Definitely try book a table 
R0171,Super attentive personalized service without being intrusive
R0171,Super breakfast on a rainy Sunday morning  Had a wonderful time catching up with friends
R0171,Super evening  The food was outstanding probably one of the best meals I have had in Ireland ever 
R0171,Super Experience from start to finish     Food  Service  Waitress  Restaurant  and  of course the company
R0171,Super food with a great local variation on the usual menu  Excellent service and atmosphere
R0171,Super night
R0171,Super night  Amazing food and service  Cocktails even nicer
R0171,Super spot  Food excelent staff very attentive and very friendly 
R0171,Table booked for 12 45 and reservation confirmed in advance  Not seated to out table until 13 05 almost 13 10  There were just 2 of us  This was raised with staff but they just shrugged their shoulders in complete and utter ambivalence 
R0171,Table booked for 8 15pm and were kept waiting for over 30minutes  No apologies given  There were a number of issues with the food and we did mention them to the waiter and nothing was done about it  The food is also overpriced 3 95 for a little bit of sauce for a steak and steak comes with nothing  Service was good and staff friendly 
R0171,Table was booked for 19:45   it wasnt ready and we had to wait until 20:15 to be seated  Never received such bad service  And they tried to add on service charge of  Euro 30  ridiculous  Never again  will be telling everyone to AVOID
R0171,40 mins waiting on drinks  waitress knocked over a glass of wine when removing our menus and it smashed on the floor  never received an apology  glass went into my handbag and onto my friends foot  wine was never replaced that had been spilled  And to make things even worse   at 10pm they came to us and said they needed our table after we had just ordered another round of drinks 
R0171,"Terrible food some great staff some terrible  A pint of Guinness in a baloon glass 
Avoid unless they get their act together 
There are great Restaurants and Pubs around the area"
R0171,Terrible service  rude staff  awful food  for main course I had chicken and my mother had fish  both were inedible  Asked multiple times for air conditioning to be lowered as it was freezing but we were ignored  sat with coats on for the entire meal  One of the worst dining experiences Ive had in Dublin 
R0171,Terrible service  Booked a table for 9:45pm vut wasnt seated until 10:30pm and only because we complained twice  Had about 5 different waiters and only one was decent  Was told after last calls that last calls were already made  strange    Food good but wouldnt go back as service spoilt the experience 
R0171,Terrible service  Checked in and left to wait in bar 30 minutes then phoned to ask did we want our reservation and had to explain we were there  Waited disappeared halfway through and no goodbye or handover 
R0171,Terrible  Left waiting 30minutes despite having a reservation while heavily pregnant  Absolutely awful in every way 
R0171,Thank you we truly enjoyed our experience and will be back 
R0171,Thats my 3rd time there   love it and have recommend to a number of friends  Great food and  value for Centre of Dublin 
R0171,The afternoon tea volume was on the light side  The service was excellent and the champers delish 
R0171,"The ambience is great; the food is mediocre  Also  the service is disappointing  My Rib eye was burnt from the outside   where the dark pieces were bitter   and had to be cut off  When I complained to the waitress  she immediately informed the floormanager  The manager did his best to come with excuses why it tasted like that; and why I was wrong to expect anything else  He suggested I go for a pan grilled steak next time; when I do not like burnt steaks 

I have worked 5 years in a restaurant; and I think I know perfectly well on how a charcoal grilled steak is supposed to taste  Smokey   yes  Burnt   god no  

The venue is great; too bad the service doesnt live up to it "
R0171,"The area I was seated in was cold  the evening was cold and damp and I could not feel any heat inside 
My order was taken quickly but the food was very slow to arrive  Starter: Prawn Cocktail contained 5 prawns and an awful lot of Lettuce no way value at  Euro 11 95 mains just OK  desert Warm Cappuccino Cake which was cold 
My second visit here and much worse than my first "
R0171,The atmosphere was really great  particularly around the christmas period 
R0171,The atmosphere was very good and the service was excellent  The desserts were delicious 
R0171,The attitude of the �welcoming� party was dreadful  We were 15 minutes delayed due to traffic and called to let the team know  We were made feel like we committed murder    The funny thing was we were left waiting 35 minutes to get a drink at our table  Never again  Better food  service and attitude elsewhere in town  The decor and atmosphere is very good 
R0171,The attitude of the service staff spoiled what should have been a relaxed dining experience  They did not listen to my mothers requests and walked off before she had finished making her order  and we were left waiting 30 minutes before anyone came to take our order despite several attempts to get the staffs attention   one just waved us away like we were flies  Then they had the audacity to put a mandatory service charge which I was annoyed with myself that I paid without objecting and asking for it to be removed  There were just two of us and a mandatory charge in my opinion is only every warranted for parties of six or more  They brought the wrong food order to my mother  beef instead of fish special she ordered and when we brought this to our attention  it was taken away with a sigh and no apology  The side of chips were cold  My chicken Milanese was nice  Overall a very unenjoyable dining experience and one I will not be repeating or taking clients to either 
R0171,The chocolate bomb was delicious but the main courses were mediocre  Ive had far better meals  Expensive for what you get 
R0171,The coffee is good but the service is super slow  Ive been given a wrong order three times now  so I wont be going back 
R0171,The Dublin branch doesnt stand up to the London or Dubai  foodwise
R0171,"The duck starter had very little dick in it  We ordered the egg and chips for main course and the meet was stringy and very tough  it required a huge amount of chewing  We were unable to finish it as it was so difficult to eat  

Service was very good and the venue is beautiful "
R0171,The food had no flavour  and   for the price  was very poor value 
R0171,The food is not up to scratch  Service was good in both the bar and dining areas  Regardless of how visually simulating the venue is the food needs to deliver aswell 
R0171,The food is terrible   The best thing on the menu is the sourdough bread   which you can get anywhere 
R0171,"The food menu is not interesting  
I ordered poached eggs but it came with oily fried eggs  The staff asked me if I wouldve like to change but I didnt change as I already waiting my food  It would be great if the staff pay more attention when customer order specific food "
R0171,The food was a big let down but the venue and service was fantastic
R0171,The food was absolutely delicious and the staff were exceptional  I loved it 
R0171,The food was amazing and we did not have to wait long for the food  Our waitress was so nice and very helpful 
R0171,The food was average and the atmosphere was poor but the biggest disappointment was the service  Possibly the worst restaurant experience Ive had in Dublin 
R0171,The food was old  reheated and refried  It was obvious  management didnt seem too concerned about it  Disappointing considering  in London is incredible every single time and this one is a coin toss 
R0171,The food was really poor  Id heard this from a lot of people but wanted to try it anyway  Extremely disappointed  The food had a very processed taste to it  very over priced  The bathrooms were dirty  However our server was lovely although we felt like we were being rushed and the tables are on top of each other  Overall not a good experience 
R0171,"The food was reasonably priced but very bland  a lot of the other customers were taking pictures which I didnt like as I was conscious I was in some of them  
The service was good  but no one asked my food was  I probably wouldnt recommend for breakfast/ brunch but would try it for dinner  Not completely unimpressed but I think there are other places close by with nicer food "
R0171,The food was so flavorful and delicious 
R0171,The food was tasteless and dry   probably the worst brunch Ive ever had  We had at least 4 different servers while we were there  all of whom were polite but distracted  The decor is beautiful here but I prefer restaurants who put more effort into their food than their image so I wont be back  Its unfortunate as I am a regular customer in the London branches of    all of whom seem to have a better balance between style and substance 
R0171,The food was very good but sadly the staff and service werent great  I waited 45 mins for an ice tea and it took 30 mins for our plates to be cleared  It wasnt particularly busy as I can understand if it was and there was no acknowledgement of us waiting  Massive hype and I was very excited to try this place with the girls  Unfortunately I was left disappointed 
R0171,The food was very good  but the service was poor   I waited for 15 minutes after being seated after which time I approached a waiter who was very rude to me as she went to get a manager   The manager was apologetic and took my order   The food was very good  as usual  I have been same place at York and Leeds BUT I felt upset at my treatment   firstly  being ignored and secondly being spoken to in a rude way when I politely pointed out I was being ignored   I wont be coming back to this place in Dublin   I will give it some thought about this place York and Leeds 
R0171,The food was wonderful   if I could have given no star for service I would have  Dreadful is the only way to describe it  our table wasnt ready when we had gone in  we waited 40 minutes to be seated for a booked table  the wait times between courses and lack of attention from servers was appalling  Will not be back
R0171,The food  the service  the ambience  all fab   first of many  many visits Im sure
R0171,The front desk staff are very rude and very in welcoming to the whole this placeexperience  Its not the first time I have experienced this and I did mention that to our waiter on the night who was very pleasant and helpful  He acknowledged that he had heard the same from others in relation to front desk staff  Its the first impression you get and I wont be back
R0171,"The front of house are terrible  
The judgement and lack of professionalism from the first look is awful  They make you feel not up to par "
R0171,The great Gatsby atmosphere is the perfect timeless setting in the heart of Dublin  As the venue  of my Graduation meal i really felt so special upon arrival  Service was amazing and the quality of the food was truly impeccable  Would highly recommend  it truly is a must see 
R0171,"The interior space promises much in terms of quality and variety which is not reflected in the menu  
The menu is limited and the food not of sufficient standard to justify repeat visits  
I suspect that following the curiosity period when Irish people go to experience  for the first time the repeat business will not materialise as the food is not good enough   will therefore rely primarily on tourists which is fine during the summer months but a problem during the winter 
Wines are expensive for what they are in terms of quality 
Having opened for a short time the poor press reviews and HR dispute with staff has done serious damage to  s reputation before it really got started  In Dublin this matters as  the target audience for the restaurant is a close knit community unlike the disparate scale of London  
Very important to reverse the poor reputation immediately and address the food quality or I see serious problems for the operation in 2019 "
R0171,The meal and atmosphere was perfect for my partners birthday  They even finished the meal with a small birthday cake with a candle for him which was an extra lovely touch to the meal  Would highly recommended this place and will most defiantly be back 
R0171,the place looks amazing  the staff were difficult to understand  the starters were good  the mains were awful  surely anyone can do a minute steak 
R0171,The quality of the food was amazing  Fast and efficient and friendly staff 
R0171,The restaurant itself is lovely  Our table for two by the window was freezing  and Im warm blooded  I mentioned the draught and the manager turned the heating up  If things didnt warm up in two minutes we could move  Dinner was served  too late for a move  Decided to just finish the mains   sides were nice  main event medioxre  truffle fries had weird texture   skip dessert and be gone  Wed waited 3 months on a table  Ive no desire to return
R0171,The salmon we received looked and tasted incredibly booring
R0171,The service and staff  are very slow  waited much longer for the table from the time booked 
R0171,The service at my table was excellent  our waitress was polite and helpful  
R0171,The service is extremely poor  Basically the cicktail waiters believe that they are a cut above all the customers     very poor I can think of much betterpkaces to spend my hard earned cash  this placeDublin has alit to learn   NIT FOR ME
R0171,"The service was poor  
The waitress got the order wrong and our party of 3 all ate at different times 
1 order was correct  1 order was cold and 1 was completely wrong  
The correct order ate when the food came out  the cold food was reheated and then she ate hers and the wrong order had to be cooked from scratch meaning this lady ate when the other 2 were finished  
The food was nice but not amazing  
This was at 10 30am on a Sunday morning   not what I would class as a busy time so I cant imagine how bad it is in a really busy period  
Decor is AMAZING   the best thing about this place 

Would I return though  No "
R0171,The service was very poor  every course was slow  Drinks were slow to arrive on most occasions and a number of sides were forgotten with the main course  We were asked to leave at the end of the meal as the table was required back  notwithstanding the wait time between every course being excessive  The setting is lovely  however the service has to be improved  The food was good but overpriced for what it is 
R0171,"The setting was really really nice  love the decor and space between groups etc  The service and food were both disappointing  We were a group of 8  starters scored high  all of us were disappointed in the mains  and deserts were overpriced for what they were  We may try again   however the biggest concern was that having brunched from 2 30 to 5 00   most of the group were hungry and ate sandwiches/toast around 8pm    Maybe it is a settling in period  and we will try again before putting it on our ""No"" list"
R0171,The setting  ambience and service was very good  My main course Shepherds Pie was extremely disappointing  When I make my own it at home it is way superior  Customers should be advised that it is a small portion in advance  I tried to give feedback when it was taken away but when I commented it was okay I was not asked way  I would not return to the restaurant on this basis
R0171,The soup was the only good thing for me  The food was not good at all and the service was worse 
R0171,You have to order and pay and they will bring out the food for you  I ordered their daily special  which was the grilled chicken  It comes with a salad  coleslaw and fries  I asked if I can replace the fries with more salad  apparently not 
R0171,The staff leave a lot to be desired  I dont think they smiled once throughout the evening  very poor service for such a high class restaurant 
R0171,The staff were  very friendly    good choice of food   good atmosphere  
R0171,The surroundings were amazing and the service was excellent  Food was presented well and really tasty  5 stars from me 
R0171,"The venue is beautiful and it has a nice warm atmosphere despite it being a very large building  The staff were very friendly  
However  the food was really not up to scratch considering the price  I could go to another restaurant anywhere in town and get the better version of the same dish for half the price "
R0171,The worst cup of tea Ive ever been served  and Ive made the mistake of ordering tea in America   Slow service  20 mins to get the bill   Great decor and the loos are lovely   but a good restaurant needs good food   defiantly style over substance here unfortunately  Arrived with great expectations and left decidedly underwhelmed  theres room for improvement when you leave a restaurant  knowing you could have made it as good as / better yourself 
R0171,Third trip to  was underwhelming  Service poor  service average at best  Dont believe the hype 
R0171,This is my 4th time dining in  and I was very disappointed with the service  On sitting down the first thing the waiter told me was that he needed the table back in 2 hours time  I was not welcomed or made feel comfortable  It was not a good experience  I booked the table last year for a birthday event and I was very frustrated  The food was excellent  the service poor 
R0171,This is the 2nd time I have been to  and I was very impressed last time everything was excellent   This time everything was laboured FOH were very unhelpful and un welcoming they didnt offer to take our coats show us to our table  It seems because we have had a buggy we were the enemy received no help to store it  We arrived 10 minutes early then shoved to the bar after while directed to our table  We mentioned to the waiter that we had an allergy and could he recommend an alternative he wasnt interested and laboured to another choice  This seemed to be the theme of the visit deeply disappointed with the service FOH and the attention to detail totally different experience from original visit  There seemed to a lack of leadership no one was overseeing anything and its current level I would not recommend   
R0171,This is the third time I have dined in this place in  Dublin   It remains my favourite restaurant  The food  service and ambience are impeccable 
R0171,This Monday we visited  for our Anniversary as we have been for every big occasion since its opening as we had loved it there  However  in short we were very disheartened when our server congratulated �one of us for our �birthday despite the complimentary tart stating Happy Anniversary 
R0171,The complimentary tart was about the size of my thumb 
R0171,This place is fabulous  Food was delicious  Staff were so friendly  We loved it     well definitely be back
R0171,this placelooks the part but service and food let it down   We were there for breakfast and all ordered the full Irish   Most of it was inedible   No butter was served with toast   We ha to ask numerous times for it   Other tables food looked nice and I would go again as the setting was lovely   Maybe a cocktail or coffee and desert next time 
R0171,this placerestaurant is overrated and expensive they even charge you for the sauce with your steak what a joke definitely wouldnt recommend restaurant proceed up the road for much better quality and better  prices     
R0171,This was a very enjoyable experience and the service was outstanding  A few faults on table etiquette  in which I was surprised that the staff werent trained on  Simple things like who to serve the wine to first  how to serve the courses  who first and from what side etc  However i would highly recommend this restaurant for value and ambience  It seems to attract the ladies more than the men  so men be prepared  That said it does cater for both and I would highly recommend it for a truely enjoyable evening that is quite affordable 
R0171,This was my first visit and most certainly be back  Service and food was top class
R0171,This was my first visit to this place and my experience was everything I expected it to be  In a word exceptional 
R0171,This was my second time here  afternoon tea this time  5 stars every time  
R0171,This was my second time in  attending with different friends as I wanted to give it a second chance after my first time  I felt it was even worse this time  It took 20 minutes for a waitress to acknowledge us and take our order  We were only given the option to have our steak cooked two ways  which was an immediate red light for me   The steak arrived 7 minutes after we ordered it and before our drinks even got to the table  The only way for me to describe the steak is a �holiday steak�  something you would find in Spain which is half the thickness of a quality Irish piece of meat  It was not worth the supplement  Euro 4 we had to pay at all  After being in the restaurant for half an hour and having our main course finished already  my friend asked if we could wait a while before our dessert  To which the waitress replied �well you only have the table for 2 hours�  This is fair enough but we already knew this from our booking and we had only been at the table for approximately 40 minutes  It was very rude  We felt like we were being pushed out of the restaurant  which was only half full   and that our custom was not welcome   has a lot of competition on   alone and I was quite disappointed on both occasions especially for the money we spent  My friend had booked a table for her birthday in December but after our experience is now subsequently cancelling this reservation to go elsewhere 
R0171,This was my second time visiting and for a second time very poor front door greeting  again staff seem unsure and not very welcoming  Service staff again poor  No offer of water while waiting   no staff keeping an eye out for customers who wished to order
R0171,"This was my second visit to     Having had a fantastic experience here last August  I invited family to dine for brunch this past Saturday  

The host staff were so very welcoming and the lady who took our payment was very personable  

Our server didnt seem to have the assistance he required to serve the section he was overseeing 
After our two guests arrived and were seated  we waited a very long time for our orders to be taken  One member of our party had to ask twice for the last part of his meal to be delivered  
We tried to order drinks on a number of occasions but were over looked  

It has likely been noted already that the ladies bathrooms were a mess  I say it has likely been noted as a number of woman in the lineup to use the beautifully decorated bathrooms had also commented upon it  I had to clean down the sink are before use and the bins were overflowing  I tried to speak to a manager to let them know but couldnt find anyone 


We were asked at the end of our meal how the food was  The food was nice but the service unfortunately on this occasion really let down the experience  
I did really appreciate the mini Happy Birthday dessert plate delivered to our Birthday girl "
R0171,This was my second visit to    First night was lovely but not the same service on my last visit  Service was very poor at the bar and also at our table    tables were very close to other diners so no privacy bit uncomfortable  When leaving I explained concerns over service but honestly it made no difference I felt dismissed 
R0171,This was my third time at  this year and it will be my last   The attitude and manner of your managers is shocking  Our waiter was a nervous wreck after being repeatedly told to ask us for drinks even though we had order drinks 
R0171,Two managers in particular were ridiculous  A auburn/red haired woman and a man with a dark beard  the lady the particular seemed obviously desperate for drinks orders  I had heard about the bad attitude of managers in  but I never witnessed it myself until Wednesday 
R0171,This was my third visit and I took a chance after the poor service of my second visit  Unfortunately I was let down again by the poor service  Our waiter stank of cigarettes every time he stretched over the table   We were a table of Chefs and all agreed that the quality of food was poor and disappointing   The burger  in particular  was over cooked  dry and tasteless  We will not be returning and will not be recommending to others

R0171,"This was our 2nd visit having previously had a fabulous experience With the family for Sunday Brunch   Saturday evening didnt start off well as Id requested on my reservation booked 4 weeks prior to be seated at the end of where the tables for 2 are as the seats/ tables are very close to each other but the end of the 2s is almost like a booth  We were sat bang in the middle with no acknowledgement at all relating to my request so why bother asking if you have any requests on the booking form  So that was a waste of time     
I think that you can tell a lot about some where when the waiter brings your wine to the table and says     ""shall I just pour it ""  Oh  and I nearly forgot to mention that the wine arrived after the startes did    

The whole dining experience lasted 1 hour for 2 courses  far too quick between each course arriving  we felt extremely rushed 

Its a huge shame as the ambiance is superb  and decor is fab but our waitress on Saturday night was in the wrong job  or poorly trained  or maybe both     "
R0171,Thoroughly enjoyed our visit  Food was delicious  wine selection very good and lovely atmosphere
R0171,To be honest �No�   Service is appalling although staff very pleasant  Repeatedly had to remind them as if the waiting staff were still on the first day   This isnt the first time  4th to be exact  either so doubt ill return  A bit of a mess overall   Its a shame 
R0171,"To be quite honest was very disappointed with  from the very start I felt let down We arrived about five minutes before our reservation and were directed to the bar we were told to wait there until called  25minutes later and still waiting Went back to front desk and they had completely forgotten us  and cancelled our reservation as I got a notification saying sorry we missed you and then one of the hostess was blaming it on a new girl that had started which was very unfair and unprofessional about speaking about a colleague to me a customer Dinner was fine food wise and the service was fine after that They did give us a complementary drink regarding our long wait Overall I wouldnt be rushing back as front of house customer service was not
Professional enough please get your act together and make your team work together because first impressions count "
R0171,Tommy our waiter was brillaint so friendly and attentive   
R0171,"Tommy was the manager in our area of the restaurant and he was excellent
This was our third time here and we will be back "
R0171,"Too cold under air conditioned seating 
Left waiting 30 mins for a full Irish breakfast and beans and toast without any comment from the server as to why it was taking so long  Restaurant wasnt busy at the time  11am on a Tuesday morning  Not acceptable from a place like this "
R0171,Too few floor staff for the amount of diners  attention to detail lacking  The music was way to high in volume  causing diners to have elevated voices  leaning in over tables trying to hear others at table 
R0171,Too noisy portions small and you are not told when ordering  A lot of trys let fall which did not help the noise
R0171,Unfortunately  I was disappointed   I booked the table for my cousin and her boyfriend for a treat  For a very special occasion  engagement      To hear that the service was so bad  And that the chosen courses arrived 15 minutes apart  leaving one very cold dinner  awaiting for the other to arrive   And that the side dish was left in front of my cousin   as if it was a main course  only to have the dish that was ordered arrive  15 mins later   Although they enjoyed their food   when it actually arrived eventually at the same time        they felt at this stage of the restaraunt   that is now  been open  two months  That most of these earlie problems should be ironed out by now      I have been reccomending  to my clients todate   Because I work in molesworth street in a very well established salon   And now I may be more reserved of passing on this reccommedation  I hope you do get the service up to the standard of  London soon   Because you where a happy welcome to our street 
R0171,"Unfortunately I wont be going back top    I went for breakfast with my wife which was fine   The next morning I arrived at 7 30on my own knowing that it opens at 7 00  I hadnt made a reservation as the morning before there was only 1/2 dozen people there  
I was told by a member of staff and a manager that ""We dont take walk ins until 8 00"" The restaurant had 1 costumes inside  
I asked are you not open until 8 00  And I was told once more ""We dont take walk ins until 8 00"" 
Im not a sensitive sort but it was embarrassing to have to around and leave "
R0171,Unfortunately our experience was not good they ran out of cocktail glasses for our drinks the drinks were very poor especially compared to places like westbury  and  this place   Food arrived 2 hours after we arrived  Service was slow on drinks just like the place is not up  and  running yet   This is my third time at   and  service is very slow 
R0171,Upon arrival on Tuesday 8th of January for our booked meal at 6 45pm the man who greeted us was beyond rude  smart liped and down right ignorant    when we finally got past the fact we had a reservation he was still rude   we were then seated in probably the worst seating area and had to ask to be moved half way through which again seemed a big task   Our whole experience was ruined and will not be recommending to any friends or family to visit 
R0171,Venue lovely     service not so much  felt rushed out half an hour before our allocated time was up   
R0171,Very bad service  First drinks ordered were let fall and then they forgot to replace them  We ordered another round of drinks but these were forgotten yet again  After dinner I asked for a coffee but was told Id need to have it at the bar because they needed the table but the table wasnt needed and I then was allowed to have coffee when I asked another waiter  Service was all over the place but food was good and reasonable  Nice setting but staff let it down  Our waiter was very nice   it was the staff dressed in suits that were the cause of all the issues on this visit
R0171,Very busy restaurant  Good atmosphere  Good food  Good service  Wasnt blown away by any element but overall was good value for money and a fun night 
R0171,Very cold at our table and staff unreceprive of this feedback and hard to get attention for service  Lovely decor but felt under staffed 
R0171,"Very disappointed 
Service poor and no attention To detail"
R0171,"Very disappointed that you didnt sell any beer ie Heineken/ Carlsberg etc considering as you have a very nice bar   
As a result we didnt order any alcohol "
R0171,Very disappointed with Afternoon Tea  Two tiny savory items  No choice for non mushroom/fish eater  Had to have cucumber sandwich instead  Ridiculous for a restaurant   Will not be recommending 
R0171,Very disappointed with the service  I had a 1 30pm booking and we werent seated until 2pm because they gave out table to somebody else  We werent even offered a complimentary coffee or anything off the bull to compensate for this  The food was mediocre and the waitress didnt realise that we didnt have cutlery on our table when we were served our main course  The lack of experienced waiters and servers was evident  Good buzz in the place and nice decor but the food and service were poor 
R0171,"Very disappointing visit   

Was really looking forward to visiting the restaurant after struggling to get a booking many times  we managed to get a booking due to it being a Thursday evening 

Group of 4   we brought friends for ours for a wedding celebration  and  I really wish we had gone somewhere else 

 Euro 330 for food  and  drink for the group 

Would not have been an issue if service  and  food was worth it but on this occasion it definitely wasnt 

"
R0171,"Staff are rude  service is slow  had to remind about drinks order  struggle to get their attention   service charge of 12 5 percent included maybe this is why they are so unhappy if they feel they are missing out on tips 

Wont be revisiting  

Decor is beautiful but its about the only thing going for the place  

Save your money  and  avoid "
R0171,Very disappointment  The food and service was terrible  Our order was wrong on several occasions throughout the meal  The food was not expensive but not up to standard at all  Very slow service  dirty drinking glasses  incorrect order plus incorrect billing   I would not recommend 
R0171,Very enjoyable
R0171,Very enjoyable birthday
R0171,"Very Good Food and Very Good Service  
The Staff were very Pleasant and Professional "
R0171,Very good food  service  ambiance and decor  All round great place
R0171,Very impressed over all  the venue surpassed my expectations
R0171,Very impressed with the decor  ambiance food and most of all service  The staff were excellent  We will be back
R0171,Very nice and pleasant  Food very good and staff very attentive 
R0171,Very nice atmosphere  laid back  Staff couldnt do more for you  very friendly  Food and drinks are fantastic aswell  Would recommend to anyone 
R0171,Very nice balance of European and contemporary tastes  Trendy but with some great dishes to boot 
R0171,Very nice brunch in lovely surroundings  A bit noisy 
R0171,Very nice dining in Dublin when you dont want Pub food   Elegant inside but casual too 
R0171,Very nice experience  Appreciated the service  food and wine list  Will be back 
R0171,Very nice restaurant   food was great and staff was pleasant too  Bit noisy but overall i highly recommend this place 
R0171,very noisy  overpriced food for a very standard menu  cocktails mediocre and unpresented well  waitress was pleasant
R0171,Very overpriced  Interiors are very nice  food mediocre and very overpriced  Poor value for money 
R0171,Very pleasant
R0171,Very pleasant and enjoyable for my daughters graduation lunch
R0171,Very pleasant atmosphere and ambience  food disappointing  had crab cakes as starter   very dry and tasteless Main courses very small and sides were extra on the lunch menu  Service was good Maybe other menu choices would have been better 
R0171,Very pompous and pretentious place  bad and overpriced food  unnoticeable service 
R0171,Very poor breakfast food was cold as was the coffee the orange juice was not fresh squeezed juice   When we told waitress the food was cold she wasnt interested and made no effort to resolve it
R0171,Very poor chips with the steak  Over cooked and almost burnt oil taste
R0171,Very poor food quality and badly made cocktails  Bill was expensive and very bad value  Would not reccommend 
R0171,Very poor overall  Table late  Food poor  Underwhelming at best 
R0171,Very poor waiting staff  and  the food was dreadful
R0171,very poor  bad food   poor service  pretty place but def never going back   is just a chain now 
R0171,Very poor  one of our minute steaks was cold on arrival  sent back and not replaced just reheated but still not warm through    We told our waitress who said she would send over a manager but no one came to the table to see how we were 
R0171,Very quick service  Complimentary coffees  10/10
R0171,Very slow service  my mains arrived without sides which we pointed out and they arrived later  been here before and wasnt impressed  Gave it a second chance and still not impressed 
R0171,Very underwhelming experience  Very expensive for what you get  Will not be going back 
R0171,Visited  over Christmas with my partner for afternoon tea   When ordering the waitress was quick to tell me that there was no vegetarian afternoon tea option  even though I had contacted in November when booking to confirm    She proceeded to hand me the lunch menu with vegetarian options and to chose from that   This is not what we came for and we had to ask for a Manager    The Manager was quick to confirm that there was indeed as option and to apologise and blame the waitress for the misunderstanding   This was not the waitress fault as it was clear the girl had not been trained properly   At this point we were 30 minutes into our 2 hour time slot with no food and drink as they had forgotten the champagne we ordered and we had to remind them   When the food did arrive it was lovely and that cannot be faulted only for the portion size   We were not approached by the waitress again but the couple beside us was asked throughout their 3 course meal was everything ok   We ordered table tap water only to be charged for this      to finish when we arrived our jackets werent taken and we had to sit with them slung over the back of our booth   when we  were settling bill and readying myself to leave my vintage white coat was on the floor in clear view of staff walking by and no one bothered to pick it up   At this point  I had to walk out of  in pure annoyance at the poor service received throughout   I purchased this as a gift for my partner I paid additional fee for the gift voucher to be personalized and for him to keep    only for it to be taken 
R0171,Waited 20 mins to be seated  menu is quite bland  and overpriced  Overrated 
R0171,Waited 45 min for main course    cold and no offer of redress    extra for sides is not a good marketing idea
R0171,Waiter  never  told me his name   Quit  rude    Didnt talk at all  The place  itself  was  lovely   Went to get a drink  before  meal  had to wait  ages to be served  or to get anybodys  attention to order   Food was nice but a bit  over priced  with what  they served 
R0171,Waiter knocked my glass of procecco over  didnt automatically replace it so we had to ask for another and when the bill came the replacement glass of procecco had been charged and nothing said about it 
R0171,Waiter/waitress service was not Great  we were there for breakfast  we ordered extra toast but didnt get it until after our breakfast  and  we found it difficult to attract waitress attention   Even the waiter who brought the food out from the kitchen had to wait for a waitress  to take the food from him to serve it to customers  customer beside us asked for more tea   as her tea was cold by the time breakfast was served 
R0171,Waiting on table place is very busy on Saturday night lots of staff walking around no organisation at all standing at the bar waiting for name to be called like been in tgi Fridays not relaxing at all my starters were nice my husband ordered fillet steak there was a taste of it asked the waitress she said chef rubbed garlic on it this should be on the menu not nice at all I had fish and chips couldnt eat it all as batter on fish was way too hard
R0171,Waitress was nice but we were waiting far too long between courses  Very loud and the menu is way overpriced   Euro 3 95 extra for a sauce with a steak is ridiculous 
R0171,Waitress was nowhere to be found  Worst service Ive had there and yet it doesnt stop them from adding a service charge 
R0171,Was my second visit to  and I think the food is of a very low standard  It is not good value for money  I dont mind paying a lot for good food but the food here is not good quality  My starter the crab tian was tiny and not even leaves on the plate  the dessert the strawberry sundae felt like the meringues were just out of a packet at tesco  The main of salmon was ok  fries were slightly cold  Not impressed and would never go back to   
R0171,Was very pretentious the food was good quality the service was ok however I have eaten better food in restaurants where you are welcome and where other diners dont think that they are better then you      Bad experience would not return
R0171,We arrived at 7 30 for drinks before dinner at 9 15   We were seated at the bar and the cocktails were amazing   At 9 30 nobody had come to take us to our table   we asked a passing waitress to enquire about our table she said she would but never came back   We asked another waiter then he said he would find out   he came back to say there were a few tables paying their bill and we would get the next available table   We told him we had a reservation made since December for this dinner and half an hour wait was not good enough   We got our table just before 10 oclock followed by an apology from another manager who said they would take the wine off our bill   Aside from that the food was lovely   despite not getting fed until after 10 30   we had 2 steaks and 2 fish dishes   which everyone enjoyed   It was our first time to go there   not sure if we would be rushing back to be honest 
R0171,We asked our server to ensure there were no onions in our main course as my friend and I dont like them  When our salmon starter came out there were little red onions blended in with the salmon which meant neither of us could eat it  Our server returned to us to collect our plates and asked why we hadnt touched them  to which we reminded her that we dont like onions  She just shrugged her shoulders and took the plates away without even an apology 
R0171,"We booked a table weeks ago for a Monday night  When we arrived we were shown a table on a line of tables which I dislike  The noise was dreadful and sitting next to people each side of you so that if you turned right or left you would be looking into someone elses face  For my wife to hear me speaking the other tables could also as one had to raise ones voice to a level to be heard  I ordered a pint of Guinness only for it to arrive in a bowl shaped glass that is used for cocktails  I asked the server is that the best glass you could put a pint in and all I got were a few nondescript giggles and she walked away   Our waiter asked me if I would like another drink which I told him ""yes but not in a glass like that one"" After a long wait he said they found a glass and the Guinness tasted a lot better than the first one so I suspected they ran across to the pub and sourced one as he had already told me that they have no such pint glasses  My wife ordered a hamburger and she left a good portion of it  never happened before with her  and said that it tasted off   With the snob attitude of the staff  we declined to mention anything as Im sure they would have their answer sheet well read and prepared  As the old saying goes ""once bitten twice shy"" Never again "
R0171,We booked for a pre theatre dinner  so early start   They didnt have what we wanted on the pre theatre menu  so advised we could have the same thing from a La Carte menu   We were then advised that it was sold out at 5pm      Really    
R0171,We both enjoyed our first visit for lunch   we will return some time again and go for dinner 
R0171,We both ordered steak and we were very disapointed  even the quality of meat wasnt good   itself is beautiful  maybe good for a drink but not food
R0171,We didnt feel welcome at all  we got a table but we were told that we could only have it for 45 mins as we were a bit late for our reservation  So we could only order a main course and no set menu  We got an unstable table  got the food  really small portion for the prize  and after we had our main we were asked to leave soon but we could still order a desert if we wanted and hurry up  Over all I didnt like it  The interior was nice but we had a very unpleasant experience 
R0171,We felt our food was very average  especially considering how expensive it is  Everything was plain and boring 
R0171,"We found the service appaling  For everything we needed we had to try to wave at a waiter at least once  This was most disappointing as we travelled from Wexford just to dine with you  The staff that did serve us we fine  Not pleasant not rude  At no point during our 3 courses did anyone ask if everything was ok or even if we enjoyed our food  

A most disappointing experience  We wouldnt return or recommend "
R0171,We got a well positioned table when dining late on a Friday but the music level was way too loud  DJ playing dance music at a volume which made conversation impossible except by shouting  Food fine but wouldnt draw me back  Would not recommend to anyone
R0171,"We had a delightful evening meal with friends The ambience  decor welcome attention of waiter and quality of food was superb My husband and friend chose sirloin steak and said it was the best ever tasted and we are seasoned travelers 
We look forward to returning on many many occasions and have highly recommended you to all my friends  Welcome to Dublin  
P Anne Freyne  Dr "
R0171,We had a fabulous time there  My boys aged 5 and 7 had a ball  They were raving about their gorgeous burgers and my son Joshua had the chocolate bomb which was the highlight for him  he loved the experience as we all did and the mojitos are the best I have ever tasted  Ambiance and service was fantastic and would highly recommend it 
R0171,We had a family celebration here mid week  The ambiance was lovely  however the service was just OK  We had a new member of staff look after us    maybe it was the inexperience however  there were a few notable mistakes    Bread was brought to the table but there were no side plates or butter knives set   we had to ask for them   For the main meal   one of our guests received the wrong dish   they received a lamb dish instead of chicken dish and the waiter proceeded to tell us that the lamb was in fact chicken a number of times  even though chicken and lamb are noticeably different    another member of staff came to the table and rectified the error   Having said that the waiter did pick up after that and we got our coffees on the house due to the mistake   I would recommend  to a friend
R0171,We had a great night  the service  and food was faultless  I loved the decor
R0171,We had a great time here  The newly open restaurant has great food  reasonably priced  great drinks and superb service  We will be back
R0171,We had a lovely breakfast which was very reasonably priced  The atmosphere was perfect  Overall it was very enjoyable and I would highly recommend it 
R0171,We had a lovely evening  lovely ambiance  lovely food  lovely staff and yummy cocktails 
R0171,We had a lovely evening  Food was really tasty  service was exceptional and the drinks were fantastic 
R0171,We had a lovely time at brunch on Saturday  Everything was great  Thanks   
R0171,We had a lovely time here  hopefully return again soon  One disappointment was I thought the margaritas were very small 
R0171,We had a magnificent meal  A great evening  lovely ambience and DELICIOUS food  
R0171,"We had a very nice dinner to celebrate our 28th wedding anniversary  

The booking was to hour taste a bit late  21:30 hrs  and to our surprise we found the restaurant just 3/4 full so we dont quit understand why we could not come earlier 

We also feel that the air condition was to strong  It was quit chilly "
R0171,We had a voucher which I got as a present but couldnt use it as our bill didnt come to the amount on the voucher so had to pay which was disappointing Tip was added on without asking as it does say optional service  at 12 5 percent nothing was said and some people left tip on tables not knowing anything about the service charge
R0171,"We had a wonderful experience and delighted to have chosen this venue for our special occasion Our waiter Tomislav was attentive from start to finish and was so obliging with anything we wanted  Service was efficient but not rushed 
We were seated in a lovely booth with ample space  The decor is fabulous  its like been outdoors and indoors all at once 
Food was delicious  We all chose different starters and mains in order to be able to compare Tempura prawns went down a treat as did the Cashel Blue salad 
My crab pasta was delicious with plenty of crab in the sauce  The lamb was divine and Fish dishes all super  Dessert  was chocolate bombs  sinful 
everyone was really happy with their food  Prices were very reasonable and ample portions size 
The wine list was good with plenty of choice     
Bar prices a little more expensive 
We appreciated the little token of acknowledgement of our occasion in the form of a dessert 
Wonderful evening out and highly recommended"
R0171,We had a wonderful night celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary  We couldnt fault   Would highly recommend in every respect 
R0171,We had Afternoon Tea and it was fantastic   Lovely service  great food and the beautiful surroundings made this a memorable afternoon 
R0171,"We had lunch there a few days ago  The soup was not tasty  the steak was gummy  the beef steak came cold and my friend sent it back  the fries were very dry  not tasty  at the desert the waiter did not exactly understand what to bring  it was totally disappointing  The spinach was the only one that was ok  The sorbet was not creamy and had chunks of ice in it which means it was defrost and then frozen again    
The only thing to appreciate is the setting of this restaurant  which is very chic  It is such a pity  The people go there only for the name of the restaurant  I went to the one in London and it was a lot better "
R0171,Service was very good and ambience very good also 
R0171,"we had to send back a terrible fish and chips  doughy batter and well overcooked chips  when replaced 15 minutes later the quality was just as bad  this meant a family dinner left one diner eating alone  not very pleasant  Chicken milanese was overcooked  Burger was dry   too lean and over minced  chips were well over cooked 
Kids chicken and chips was bone dry  

Very disappointing family celebration "
R0171,"We ordered a side of french fries and they arrived at the end of the meal instead at the beginning   They were not as good a standard as the rest of the food  
The wrong bill was given to us  they charged for 1 meal instead of 3 and this made my friends miss their bus back  
I was embarrassed as my friends had travelled from Northern Ireland for lunch to console me after my husbands death"
R0171,"We ordered from the Brunch menu on a Sunday morning  Booking was for 10 45am  slow to be looked after at the front door  Overall service was very poor  we waited 20 minutes for coffee  A lot of orders for barista  and  it was delayed  the place did not seem too busy  a number of empty tables  and  lots of staff around  
Ordered the sourdough to begin  we did not get side plates to use  and  had to request them  Also asked for more butter  it had to be sent up from the kitchen  although promised it twice  it never arrived  
My husbands rib eye was not good  very tough  and  chewy  and  the absence of a steak knife didnt help  My burger was only ok  
After waiting for ten minutes we had to request the bill a second time  Extremely disappointing meal and morning  The decor and atmosphere are fabulous  We were both looking forward to eating here having so many positive experiences in the London restaurant  I hope that service will improve  and  put this down to having a bad morning "
R0171,We really enjoyed our experience  The staff are lovely and very attentive  The food was delicious and the cocktail menu is great  Would highly recommend  although its very hard to get a table at a decent time 
R0171,"We sat waiting for 35 minutes to have our order taken 
Didnt have the wine we wanted from the wine menu 
My husband duck salad was over cooked and his lamb main was cold no one checked us during meal and we served ourselves our wine all night 
Poor service"
R0171,We spent a lovely evening in the newly opened   Great ambiance delicious food and attentive staff  Would highly recommend this restaurant 
R0171,We took American relatives for dinner and had a really lovely evening  service was excellent and food delicious 
R0171,We were 2 hours waiting for our starter  then told our time was up before we were given desert and coffees manager David   would give his surname was extremely rude   terrible experience  
R0171,We were a party of 5 with a booking for late lunch  We were seated late and at an extremely small table  Staff supervisor was extremely rude and insulting when we asked for a bigger table  The food was good and the ambience is very nice but customer service was ZERO 
R0171,We were a party of four and all were disappointed with our meal  Items were either over cooked  tasteless and /or unimaginative 
R0171,We were all exhausted from the neighborhood pub thing in Dublin   The townie chatter  yelling obnoxiousness was getting unbearable so we were looking for a nice  vibrant  classier joint    this hit it out of the park in every way  Impeccable service  fantastic menu  beautiful ambiance and great cocktails  Highly recommend 
R0171,We were asked to vacate the table 4 times and hadnt even gone over the allocated time   Think its a bit overrated to be honest 
R0171,We were disappointed when we left the restaurant and found disgruntled employees protesting outside about unfair wages  We would not have booked lunch here if we were aware of these issues 
R0171,We were disappointed with quality of food   And the service was rushed  
R0171,We were disappointed with the experience  Sat at the bar to have a drink before we ate and watched the bar man chat to someone without looking around to see if anyone was waiting  After 6 7 minutes we walked around the bar to ask him to serve us  Sat down for dinner and ordered food and drinks  The food came quickly and we were nearly finished our starter before the drinks arrived  The decor and atmosphere is lovely  We would say the food was only ok  It all felt very rushed 
R0171,We were on holiday in Dublin and brought our two younger children   Not only was the food amazing   but the overall service and friendliness of the staff to our family   I highly recommend to anyone looking for a great meal and atmosphere
R0171,We were very dissatisfied with the service last Sunday   I kept having to try and catch the waiters attention   he walked by many times even though I kept calling him  The worst part of the experience was when the Manager asked my mother if she wanted to leave a tip on the card   I explained she would rather leave cash   The Manager stooped over to stare at her keying in her bank card PIN numbers   Then proceeded to hang around waiting for the tip  which she wanted to give to the water   In the end she was so annoyed by the experience she didnt bother leaving a tip   It ruined our visit to   
R0171,We were very happy with the food wine and table service  however we were not happy with the seating  On asking to be reseated we were put at the same type of seating and the girl never returned  We wanted to sit opposed each other as we were celebrating our 35th wedding anniversary  This upset my wife and put a dampener on what was to be a special night 
R0171,Wedding anniversary   starter was average   main course was poor 
R0171,The staff made no effort to sort the situation and all in our area were uncomfortable  Polenta cakes were just unpalatable large cubes of stodge  Toilets beautiful yet poorly maintained  Not as I had expected based in Cambridge experience 
R0171,Well  Tables soooooo close together we were invested in the almighty row/swearing match at the table literally touching ours so dinner was accompanied by being British and having to listen to the argument 
R0171,Went for afternoon tea for my mams birthday and I had the nicest gluten free afternoon tea ever it was really good 
R0171,Went for breakfast and the poached eggs were stone cold  Most unpleasant breakfast Ive ever had
R0171,Went for breakfast with work colleagues  Great food and service  Didnt feel rushed but service was prompt when required 
R0171,Went for my boyfriends birthday and it truely was a great night 
R0171,Went here for dinner one day after shopping with my husband  Very good food you get 
R0171,Went here for lunch today with a few friends  I honestly couldnt eat the food I got a quesadilla with chorizo  potato and red pepper  I had about 2 bites and couldnt have anymore   It just wasnt nice and it was covered in sour cream which I dont like and didnt ask for  My friend also asked for no beans in her dish and it arrived with beans  I also got a strawberry margarita which was nice  they do know how to make a cocktail  It was like 8 euro for a tiny quesadilla which is a total rip off  I wont be returning
R0171,Went here for our 10 year anniversary and it was so nice  The chocolate bombe for dessert was amazing  would highly recommend  It was a little pricey but definitely worth it for a special occasion
R0171,Went on a voucher  had low expectations   Had to ask for a pre dinner drink  had to ask for wine with the meal  Food much better than expected  but portions are small  Service lacked attention  especially as restaurant wasnt busy  HATE that service charge is included   were Dublin not London
R0171,Went there for my mums birthday and a had a lovely time  Our waiter was terrific and made my mum feel very special  Would definitely go back again 
R0171,Went to  for a special event  The venue is very nice  and the food was great 
R0171,"Went today for breakfast and I would go back tomorrow and every day this week if I could   Great service from the moment we went through the door to the time we left   Lovely food and amazing coffee   The decor is outstanding and the ambience is very relaxed and comfortable   

I would highly recommend a visit if in the vicinity and I for one will definitely be back "
R0171,Went with my Husband for our wedding anniversary and had a fantastic time  The staff could not have been nicer and the food was fab 
R0171,What a beautiful place  The food and service was excellent
R0171,WHAT A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE FOOD WAS FAB AND STAFF VERY FRIENDLY
R0171,"What an experience  I ordered the Halibut simply grilled fish option  which was presented raw and cold after tasting the dish 
Following bringing this to attention of one of the many waiters and requesting a different dish the service became more unprofessional and unsatisfactory  
I received the new order without cutlery and although we placed a drink order it took 15 to 20 minutes to arrive and I am not sure how many different waiters attended the table  it was so unorganised  
The coffee order arrived before the desert and to be honest overall our experience was so disappointing "
R0171,Would not recommend or go back  Very rude bartender
R0171,When we arrived the table was being prepared and we were directed to the bar  The bar man never explained that he takes the order puts the receipt in a folder you put the money in the folder and your change is given back in same folder making us look like idiots trying to pay straight away  The person serving us asked what we wanted to drink and said I presume English breakfast like  I dont know my teas or maybe my English accent didnt please him just thought how rude  We were given afternoon tea with one knife to do sandwich and cut the scones  shortage on knifes  and a mouse with no spoon again shortage on spoons  I had to ask for cutlery  Would not recommend or go back
R0171,While there are better steaks out there  this is still a nice place to visit if just for the million dollar fries�
R0171,"Whilst  has an international reputation   I have eaten in the Cobham restaurant a number of times   my experience at home in Dublin was at best fair   I booked for 2 30 and rang earlier in the week to try to make it 2 pm   but was told that I couldnt do that   We arrived at exactly 2 30 and were told that our table might be 10 15 minutes late   I commented then that they had been clear on the phone that my reservation could not be brought forward   so I expected the reservation I had made to be honoured on time  I was told that the kitchen was running a little behind and directed to the bar   where we stood for a drink   We got a table about 10 minutes later   The order was taken promptly   but we waited about 20 minutes for our starter   My prawn cocktail was average   the prawns were frozen ones   and my haloumi was also average   My guests soup was good   and the risotto "" not bad ""   
I will not be recommending  to friends   There are better restaurants with better food   service and value in Dublin   You have a fair bit of work to do   
"
R0171,"Will definitely be back  Food was amazing  the atmosphere was amazing and to top it off the staff were fantastic  

Cant wait for my next visit "
R0171,Wonderful ambiance great service good choice menu wine reasonably priced decor very impressive
R0171,Wonderful ambience  decor  food  and friendly staff 
R0171,Wonderful atmosphere but service was poor throughout  While some of the empty plates were removed after the main course  mine was left for a further 20 minutes which we could not understand  Very smiley staff but I dont think they know much about service 
R0171,Wonderful experience  Very relaxing no rush  Food was served quickly  Best ever was free latte top ups   Cant wait to go back 
R0171,Wonderful food  service and atmosphere  Early bird menu is great value also  Would certainly recommend to others 
R0171,Wonderful get together with friends  love the decor and ambiance  And excellent service from our waiter
R0171,"Worse experience ever 
From waiting staff way too casual  physical contacts  language and manners/ attitude  and lacking of emotional intelligence/service recovery knowledge; to my chicken being not cooked 
Got one person served and then 30 minutes after the rest of us  In two occasions the waiter came back 20 and 40 minutes after order was taken  saying that they didnt have what we ordered anymore  
Tried to recover from that  offering ONE glass of white wine when we are 5 at the table 
Disappointing  not professional  our special occasion was not even acknowledged "
R0171,"Would not recommend food   sent 2 meals back   didnt enjoy mine although I did eat it   Ambiance lovely and staff very helpful and friendly  pity about the food   
Dont go if its good food you want "
R0171,Yeah  it was nice  I wouldnt rave about the food but would recommend it to someone if theyre looking for somewhere pretty to eat 
R0172,Didnt know their info on Celiac options   different from last time which was much better 
R0172,Good food with good value enjoy good experience                    
R0173,As always  never lets us down   lovely food  and  great value for money 
R0173,"Awful the food is bad the fish wasnt cooked and ser service is terrible 
I asked for ketchup and they gave one bag"
R0173,Beautiful experience in here  loved everything  Beef was excellent and they have nice wine too  Staff was friendly  definitely recommended 
R0173,Beautiful food  served in a lovely setting by very nice and friendly staff 
R0173,Delicious food and a very nice atmosphere  Wonderful location 
R0173,Excellent service and staff were exceptionally accommodating and pleasant  Food v good  value for money excellent
R0173,Fabulous early bird  Highly recommend if youre looking for great food and lovely ambience  Seat at the window particularly nice  Will definitely be back 
R0173,Always late with no knowledge of the the area and often have some of the order missing 
R0173,Food OK  Noisy but good ambience   My cheesecake was left on the side for about 15 minutes before being served at our table  We were too polite complain and were keen to get bill to leave 
R0173,Food was lovely  and  great value  Service was  excellent  the staff were very friendly 
R0173,Good wine and service 
R0173,Great food  The Chicken Royale and goat cheese salad were delicious�great suggestions from our waiter James   And great service from James 
R0173,Great night thank you  Service was great  and I loved the fish special
R0173,Had dinner  recently and absolutely loved it  food was amazing and service excellent  Would highly recommend to friends and family 
R0173,Honestly  this place could justifiably charge twice as much for the food if the service was up to scratch  When taking our order our server stared into the middle distance  no attempts to converse or friendly banter  After finishing our mains we were left wanting dessert but the menus never came  Chatting with colleagues seemed to be prioritised over keeping an eye on the tables  We ended up just calling it a night  Your food deserves better 
R0173,"I have eaten here a few times  and found the food to be of quite a good standard  however was let down this time 
Poached eggs were overcooked for me and my friend  and the beans were cold meaning they had to be sent back to the kitchen to be redone   I was quite disappointed as a result and not sure whether I will go back 
On the positive  side  I would definitely recommend the coffee"
R0173,"It was an excellent dining experience with fine hosts and great food  We went early since we travelled all night to get to Dublin  and were sure we would ""crash"" early   However  they have an early dining and menu with special pricing   We highly recommend this restaurant    but book early as it is small and often full "
R0173,Lovely little cafe with great food and excellent and friendly service  Next time we have to visit these guys again  Thanks 
R0173,"Menu catered for all dietary requirements and food was delicious  Lovely ambiance and pleasant  attentive staff  
Ideally situated for dining before show in the Olympia theatre  Would highly recommend "
R0173,My husband and I had a one night layover in Dublin  We are not into the bar scene so we chose this restaurant for its quiet yet city center location   The restaurant had a nice quite ambience and we were sat by the window with a nice view   a request we made on online app which was honoured   However  service was not as expected  The waitress did not offer to review the specials with us  When asked she only listed the items without a detailed description with how they were cooked or dressed  Stay away from the duck  over cooked   Although the restaurant was not busy at the time  we felt like we were chasing the waitress all night to get us drinks then the bill etc  overall nice restaurant but feels like the staff were new or the restaurant was new and it did not have the workflow or the dinner cook times down yet 
R0173,Nice but nothing special  I wouldnt go again and I wouldnt recommend a friend 
R0173,Not very welcoming   We were 15 mins late   as we could not find parking  arrived to be informed our table was gone  smelled like a greasy spoon  eventually we ended up with a table beside the loos  not impressed  menu very limited   ordered main course had a look at it when it eventually arrived   then asked for the bill   even though we did not eat anything  nobody cared  Never ever going back  �Bad experiences all round  we are not the only ones   Unfortunately had to give it a 1 star otherwise my review would not be written zero stars realistically  
R0173,One of my fave places in Dublin  Good and genuine food  nice staff  good prices 
R0173,One of our party had to send back her main course twice   Also  one of person had availed of the early bird yet was charged the full amount 
R0173,"Our gnocchi was completely overcooked  When we complained we were told by waitress ""its meant to be like that     we cook it so it melts on the tongue""   Our other friends meal was cold  Far too expensive for what you get  We decided not to give a tip as it wasnt deserved only to discover afterwards on receipt that we were charged a percentage of the bill anyway as a tip  We wont be going back "
R0173,Possibly the best meal we had in Ireland  Service was impeccable and the food just out of this world  Passion fruit dessert changes my wifes life  HIGHLY recommend it 
R0173,Service was very slow considering there was only 5 people in the restaurant altogether  Food was undercooked 
R0173,The evening menu and quality of food was much better than the lunch menu  First time having lunch here  and i was disappointed  had higher expectations after the evening menu   Id sirloin steak and it was horrible  and not cooked to my preference which was medium   The cheese board while it read great  was extremely underwhelming 
R0173,The food and ambience was amazing   Unbelievable value for food  However  the servers made you feel like a burden  They brought my partner a starter and did not bring mine for 2nd   I had to ask them for it and the lady did not apologise  just seemed a bit annoyed  I could not fault the food  price or restaurant but the service really needs to be improved  They made us feel as if they were annoyed by us  We set down at half five and they said you have to be gone by 8  When they came to give menus the waiter just dropped them in the middle of the table  Very unwelcoming
R0173,"the service is bad  there is no smile  We arrived and were told we booked for 7pm when we booked for 6pm 
The waitresses are not very friendly  Food is good  very limited early bird menu choice "
R0173,This restaurant is perfect  One of the best meals Ive ever had and the service was excellent  Highly recommend the goat cheese fig starter and the pan fried salmon if they have it 
R0173,Unfortunately started badly as no record of my booking even though I showed my online app confirmation on my phone  Although told not a problem we were shown to the worst table in the house even though there were plenty of bright spacious tables available  Starters were good   goats cheese and chicken wings  Very disappointed with my cod mail course   nearly choked on a huge bone and there were lots more where that came from  Steak main was flattened and quite dry  Wont be back 
R0173,Very nice place and excellent service  Waitress Anita was very kind and polite  thank you and see you next time  Cheers  Ewelina
R0173,We stopped here for lunch and loved it  The food was delicious  coffee was great  Service was top notch   Smithfield is a fun area of Dublin to see 
R0173,We were very disappointed in the place  We had a 6:00 Reservation and arrived on time  We were told they needed the table back by 8:00  earlier would be better  We said  fine  we had theater tickets and would like to be finished by 7:15  At 7:00 we had not been served our entre  We reminded our server At 7:15 we still had not been served  At 7:20 we were given our meals to go   No time to argue  we paid full fare 
R0173,Wonderful  We enjoyed the food immensely  The service was fine  We would return again  The plum sauce on the duck was spectacular as was the chicken entree 
R0174,  This place claims to have the �best chicken wings in Dublin which is a fairly massive statement to come out with  I decided to test them out for myself last week with my two pals so we headed down on a sunny Saturday  We booked a table which was probably a good call for the day that was in it  I ordered the wings  fries and a diet coke  My pals got the wings and the Italian burger and lots of fries  The service here is really good  I enjoyed the meal and youll find yourself with a fairly massive portion of wings  They were good but I dont know if they were my favourite I ever had  Id probably return because I cant think of anything to fault about the place but the atmosphere was a bit mehhhh and you cant get milkshakes so thats why I prefer the Counter 
R0174, Please ignore the ratings; one cant review without entering them  Im not sure why the app processed a booking with this restaurant on a day when it was closed  It meant that a group of four arrived hungry and left disappointed 
R0174,As a visitor to Dublin  this was a wonderful place to dine 
R0174,Cute little place with amazing food and service  �The baked goods were fresh and the eggs Benedict was presented beautifully 
R0174,Everything was amazing  food  drinks  and especially the staff  I only wish it was in Philly  Ill be back next time Im in Dublin 
R0174,Excellent bloody marys and better buffalo wings then Ive had anywhere in the U S  sooooo good 
R0174,Excellent food at very reasonable prices  Staff were very welcoming
R0174,Excellent food  friendly staff  nice place  Well worth a visit
R0174,Excellent would recommend
R0174,Fantastic meal with friends here  We had the chateaubriand   highly recommended  Amazing meal overall  Staff were brilliant   really know their foods and wine  Cant wait to go back 
R0174,Food was good a little slow in coming but we didnt mind as it tasted good  However the service was poor  trying to pay was a debacle 
R0174,"Food was very tasty  unfortunately service was appalling  There seemed to only be one waitress covering the entire floor  As a result  we were waiting almost 20mins to place our order and another 20mins got empty plates to be cleared  One of our sides was also forgotten as was half of our drinks order and when we requested the forgotten drinks  the barman seemed put out at our question  stating he delivered everything that was ordered  
Would be reluctant to come again"
R0174,Good hearty cooking and friendly staff  Steak was a bit chewy but very good value meal 
R0174,Great food  Outstanding service  could not have had a better dinning experience
R0174,Great meal and great service 
R0174,Great staff  fabulous menu and food  Definitely worth a visit 
R0174,"Great value online  Save 20 percent when you spend over 25 Euro   
My go to dish is garlic curry  onion badji and garlic na  Everything here has always been good  The Dublin outlet is my local one  Top class "
R0174,Having read such great reviews I had been looking forward to lunch  unfortunately it was good in parts not in others 
R0174,"I was so impressed with the fish plate  and  my companions cheese platter  and  roast beef dish that I went on Google reviews to praise the place already  
On a quiet Saturday in May  they could be forgiven for not really trying  but the opposite was the case  pulling out all the stops in the kitchen  and  on the floor  
I can highly recommend for lunch any day of the week "
R0174,Its unlike any restaurant out there  Very different food to other places  Good to try something different  and nice not to have chips on a menu  
R0174,Just brilliant  as always
R0174,Loved the vibe of the Legal Eagle   very elegant  Food and service was excellent  Eclectic menu 
R0174,Lovely food and service 
R0174,Modern Irish food with fun takes on tradition
R0174,Nice room  nice staff  mediocre food  would not recommend 
R0174,Really disappointing and over rated food  The boom is back 
R0174,Small intimate cafe bar reeking of the 70s music scene  Great music  great service and run by people who were there then  Cant go wrong 
R0174,The Chateaubriand was sensational  as was everything else  Couldnt recommend this place more  Its service  decor  food and ambience were outstanding 
R0174,The food is absolutely amazing and the staff are very warm and welcoming  I definitely recommend all of their dishes  especially the aubergine ones  Mango lassi is delicious as well with cardamom 
R0174,The food is ok  menu hard to choose from  Place is lovely and service good 
R0174,The staff were so friendly and welcoming  the food was great  It was my friends birthday and they made the whole experience really nice  Highly recommend
R0174,This restaurant is divine  I went with my boyfriend as he had booked it as an anniversary surprise  He picked so well  Everything we had was unbelievable and there wasnt a morsel left on the plates that went back to the kitchen  Lovely experience 
R0174,We were there on Easter Monday so it was particularly quiet  but we had amazing service and the food was spot on 
R0174,You just need to go 
R0175,Birthday celebration made online booking  The place did not have my reservation even though the place was empty they did not accommodate 4 of us  Had to make another reservation elsewhere  Bad experience 
R0175,Everything was perfect  The service is especially wonderful with a warm welcome given  Order anything and you wont be disappointed 
R0175,Followed the directions to find the restaurant and dialed the provided phine number  No answer  Called several times   still no answer  3 guys drinking outside  bar told us to go to suffolk st and go in that way  Heard several people had the same issue as us  We were brought upstairs to a dining area where there were no other people  The menu was a subset of what was on the menu downstairs  Asked for a table downstairs and enjoyed our meal there  So   didnt eat here
R0175,Food was a little disappointing for the price
R0175,Good food  healthy  very large portions  good coffee and plenty of space in a cool  quirky Brooklyn style way 
R0175,Great concept  execution needs improving  The dirty alleyway entrance could be somewhat excused if it werent for the fact that you can exit via the ordinary Italian restaurant with which is shares its kitchen 
R0175,Great food  and  atmosphere  Waiting staff were great fun too  Its a must 
R0175,I dont know how this restaurant is because after making a reservation over a month ago when we arrived they were closed  They took a weeks vacation  I know that reservations made online go to the restaurant   It would have been nice if they contacted me so I could make other plans 
R0175,I reserved a table for my anniversary dinner   the entrance is f but once youve got past that there really isnt anything else great about it  Although we had reserved a table we were waiting to be seated over 30 mins  the waitress wasnt sure which menu we were able to order from  the cocktails named online were not available  Not pricey and we enjoyed the concept but in reality we were both left very disappointed  and hungry  
R0175,I was there Saturday 25 November for my birthday and I have to say the place did not impress me  First of all  the �secret alley� you need to walk down to get to the restaurant that they make out is really intriguing is basically where the businesses put out their bins   it was disgusting and dangerous  Then when you get to the door no one answers and you call the number to let them know you are there and no one answers that either so you are left outside in the freezing cold  When  after banging on the door for five minutes  someone finally lets you in they are not too apologetic about it and just say the bell isnt working  how do you expect to know when people arrive then   Then  the woman who was serving our table didnt know what any drinks were  One of my friends ordered a Malibu and she didnt know what that was  another ordered bourbon in her Old Fashioned and she seemed confused about that and another ordered a vodka and white lemonade and she didnt have a clue what white lemonade was  Then when I ordered a vodka and black currant she also brought me a bottle of soda water I hadnt asked for which she had already poured into it without asking  She then got very confused when we payed the bill in cash and seemed unable to understand we were owed  Euro 10 change   The one plus is the food was the food was tasty and one of my friends is celiac and they did gluten free pasta for her  I doubt I will be rushing back though unfortunately 
R0175,One of my favorite meals Ive ever had  such a fun experience finding the restaurant to find a very well crafted dining experience  Kudos
R0175,Poor service and very limited menu  Having a dairy intolerance I could only eat one thing from the menu  I had to order two starters  We had just finished our main course when I asked for the desert menu  We were then told that we only had 10 minutes left at the table that they had a private function  I was not aware of this and we had only been sat down for an hour and 20 minutes  We were then moved to the Italian restaurant where we were given a mix of desert menus from the restaurant and from the Italian  We quickly realised that all of the deserts were the exact same except this place menu was 2 Euro more on each item 
R0175,Prices seemed to be about 3euro more expensive than listed on the site  9 75 as cheapest glass of white  bit scandalous  Starter was lovely  Chicken skewer main at over  Euro 20 was really disappointing  really small portion for the price  The chicken was chalky and tasteless  the Italian sausage was again  tasteless  Found it overall disappointing as I have previously visited this place and found it to be lovely  I get the idea  but unfortunately it misses the mark 
R0175,The food here is not good  We ordered the wings  fish and chips  and blue burger  The wings had a freezer burn taste so we only ate one each before the waitress came over to take them away  The fish was that rectangular shape like it came packaged and thrown in a deep fryer 
R0175,The food was good  the cocktails great  the service on the night was good 
R0175,Very enjoyable restaurant  excellent food an service
R0175,We all absolutely loved our meal here  superb food  fabulous cocktails  great atmosphere and friendly staff 
R0175,We visited for dinner during our time in Dublin and the food was terrible  My husband and son ordered mussels and cottage pie off of the early bird menu  The mussels were served in a red sauce  which wasnt very good  The bread had a wad of herbs inside that wasnt appealing  The cottage pie  one of our favorite foods  was overly rich and just not appetizing  I ordered the ricotta pasta and it was downright terrible  Our waiter never bothered to come back to the table or I would have sent the pasta back  The best thing about dinner was the live music and filtered water  
R0175,"Went here with a group of students  17 of us in total  Students arent the richest people on earth  so the way this group was treated earns Forno 500 a subzero star 
First they told us that if wewanted dinner  we had only 1 5 hour before it would be too busy  sounds all right  cause 17 is a large group   Then they told as we had to pay an extra 10 percent becvause we were in a large group  What      Never heard of a practice like this     But all right  we seated and one of the leader students asked on forhand if we could pay by the person  so not all together  Wasnt a problem  OK 

Music was nice but far too loud  Waiters didnt speak Italian  I do  but they didnt understand   Pizzas are mentioned  on the menue  to be not crisp  because that is the Napolitan way  Well  undercooked dough isnt to be excused by its heritage  especially when the prize for a pizza is between  Euro  12 and  Euro  16  plus the already mentioned 10 percent 

When we got to paying  it didnt add up  We got a bill for the 17  not seperated  But now we know why  They had charged an extra bottle of wine   Euro  25  and some dishes  also something like  Euro  30  which we hadnt ordered  It took about half an hour to get this sorted  took some more time because the waiter didnt know how to add the 10 percent  And worst of all: no apologies  Bly me  this was an extra  Euro  55 on a bill of less than  Euro  500     

My advice: never enter this restaurant  unless you want to be cajoled  Its a tourist trap with at beste mediocre food  high prices and untrustworthy personel "
R0176,Excellent innovative food  Confident service  Best meal in a 12 day visit to Ireland  Michelin rated 
R0176,Good food  excellent value  Nice ambiance  great place to meet 
R0176,Lovely tea in very comfortable surroundings  The staff were very attentive and pleasant  I would definitely go again 
R0176,Poor from start to finish   No restaurant feel about this   we were put at a table  eventually  between parties having afternoon tea and drinks   Were asked three times how many people were we expecting   Food was very average   Incredibly noisy and rushed   Very over priced   Unfortunately  we wont be returning   
R0176,Still dreaming about this meal  Wonderful service  interesting wine pairings  Charred meat 
R0176,Whilst the setting is excellent  we found the food to be very good  but not exceptional   and service was extremely slow   to the extent that we had to ask that one main course be brought out before the others  for someone who had to get to a meeting; and for all this  you pay handsomely  over  Euro 300 for four adults  and two kids   For those who are not worried about either money or time   its delightful   but I dont think Ill be rushing back 
R0176,"Best food and beer experience Ive had in Europe 

Highly recommend"
R0177,All the food very rich and too truffle based 
R0177,Excellent service and friendly staff definitely be going again
R0177,Outstanding menu and service  Fuss free restaurant that wows the senses  Medium price range  overall good value for the innovative menus

R0178,Great experience  Very nice way to mark a special occasion

R0178,Make time and a reservation for afternoon tea  Excellent presentation  taste and selections

R0178,We enjoyed the tea time   It was delicious food  great service and a wonderful experience 
R0178,We had a very nice afternoon at The Lord Mayors Lounge for afternoon tea  Everything was delicious  and the service was top notch 
R0178,We went for a birthday celebration and had  a lovely time  Would highly recommend it 
R0178,Wonderful afternoon spent   Fantastic food and brilliant service  Would highly recommend to anyone and we look forward to going back 
R0179, An amazing place to stop by for dinner� 
R0179,A delightful building  warm and attentive service  and incredible food  A terrific place for drinks and dinner 
R0179,After the hype and lines died down Ive finally made it into the this placee in Diblin  In comparison to the US it is hard to say if they are better or worse  since it is hard to do a comparison that is not side by side  My thoughts are that the burger quality is probably about the same but the fries are worse  Although they did give me a large bag of fries even though I ordered the small  But when spending 16 70 on lunch I would prefer the whole meal to be better 
R0179,Christmas Eve dinner  The staff was amazing and the food was top notch  I would go back in a heart beat 
R0179,Considering it is a very limited menu  I expected a much higher standard  Between the four of us we had one duck  one chicken and two steaks  none of which were to a high standard  duck and steak chewy and chicken dry and way too much kale  Sides two champ both dry and one green veg  smothered in kale and one sweet potato which was soggy  the one starter of mussels were very good  At over 160 euro not good value at all 
R0179,Disappointing second visit overall   the atmosphere was poor  too bright  no music   Service was poor   Overall food and wine were good but lacked ambience in the room we were in 
R0179,Food and staff where amazing  Beautiful venue 
R0179,Food was average and arrived partly cold  Ambiance is very nice and the menu is short   however pricey and therefore not good value for money  Would recommend for cocktails  but not for the food 
R0179,Food wasnt great wouldnt return  Mains came a while before sides so half the main was eaten already 
R0179,Great experience  lovely server and beautiful food
R0179,Great service   very accomodating  I will definitely be back with friends
R0179,Main disappointment   my dining partner had a prime steak and was very disappointed with the amount of fat  She left nearly half of it on the plate as it was fat  And for  Euro 27 or whatever it was   thats not the standard youd expect 
R0179,nice atmosphere and rooms  but the food is pretty average and the service is hit and miss   for the prices they charge i wouldnt be inclined to return to be honest
R0179,"On arrival to this restraunt I felt like royalty  the staff were amazingly welcoming and a delight to deal with  The over the top Italian accents and the interest in the customer was was on point 
For starters we had the antipasti with homemade pesto  Everything was fab although I could have done with a little more Parma ham and also no seasoning on the table 
Sourdough bread was lovely and bruchetta was average 
The mains let the entire meal down  I had the lamb with pistachio crumb on a bed of rosemary potatoes  It was as basic as they come  no flavour with over fried potatoe cubes with again not a hint of flavour  No veg or sauce offered despite the  Euro 28 price tag 

"
R0179,Our booking was cancelled by the manager only when we arrived as they said they were booked out 
R0179,Our food was over cooked and lacked any real flavor  extremely disappointed based on previous reviews 
R0179,Poor menu options and over priced
R0179,Staff were inexperienced and intrusive  Food was distinctly average and table was in some sort of anteroom and felt like it was in a hallway  No atmosphere  Very disappointing compared to visit earlier this year 
R0179,Steak was pretty tough and we mentioned it and waiter said oh thats a pity  and that was it 
R0179,The food was lovely and the decor was really nice  it was lovely for a catch up with friends but not if youre looking for something more lively   The service wasnt great  they tried to lift our plates away twice while we were eating and also lifted my friends drink away before she was finished  surely its courtesy to ask if she was finished first   We ordered Gin and Tonics which were pricey enough but they were just served in regular glasses with a slice of lemon  no fancy gin glasses or anything     Very underwhelming 
R0179,Waitress was incredibly inattentive for an unfilled restaurant  Food was okay  but came up to me cold  Had to re order my wine from the bartender because my waitress repeatedly forgot  Beautiful space with amateur staff 
R0179,We took our boys  It was agood experience
R0179,We went for my sons 21st birthday  It was wonderful  The staff  the food  the cocktails and the ambience made for an absolutely fabulous evening  Patrick was the font of all knowledge telling us the origins of dishes and the cocktails  He was able to tell us how they were made and suggested pairings with our food  which definitely worked   My only regret is that I dont possess two stomachs so I could eat absolutely everything  I am a veggie and my food was divine   a limited menu but I got the impression that if I asked for anything they would do their best to provide  My sons had the lamb shank and they couldnt speak highly enough of it  I would highly recommend  We will definitely be going back 
R0180,Amazing restaurant with lovely staff  food was also amazing  Anyone whos a steak lover this is a must 
R0180,Company social lunch  table of 10   took forever for them to take our orders and then another long while before food arrived  2 hours spent just to order and eat  Will not be attending for a work lunch again  Would only recommend if you show up before youre hungry and dont mind spending a couple hours  Food was good  prices average 
R0180,Disappointed in dish  was dry and bland  Service was ineffective at times
R0180,Do not stay here  �Staff is unwilling to help and very defensive about my laptop theft  �Room 126 was targeted during my stay and two nights before a laptop was also stolen from the same room  �These things happen from time to time in a hostel shouldnt be an excuse  �The staff wouldnt question the maid service working during the timing of the theft  �The poor response to a customer warrants less than one star if I could give it 
R0180,Excellent food and great service  Always very relaxed atmosphere  Cant fault it in any way
R0180,Exceptional gelato with interesting flavours  Crepes also excellent  You need to try this 
R0180,Fabulous food and service  Highly recommend  Gin menu is also very good 
R0180,Fantastic food and drinks and very reasonably priced
R0180,Fantastic food from start to end  The servers were lovely and so helpful
R0180,Floor and chairs were dirty  Service and food very nice 
R0180,Food was fantastic  services excellent  I would highly recommend this restaurant to all
R0180,Food was great but our experience was ruined by atrocious service
R0180,Food was lovely and staff were very nice grest place to have a catch up with a friend 
R0180,From starters to main to deserts could not fault
R0180,"Good food extremely slow service  We were 10minutes waiting for some one to take our order and another 60 minutes waiting on our food  
Staff friendly but extremely slow and they all seem to be following each other around "
R0180,"Got flat soft drinks  We were never asked if we wanted a bottle or splash  Sent back so and ordered bottles  Got the bottles but no glasses  Stared at each other is disbelief  Requested glasses with ice  Got them  Nothing said to us  Burger was very nice  A colleague thought it too red  The chicken pasta s 2  looked awful to me and I was surprised they were not sent back  Neither finished  When the plates were cleared no obe asked if everything was okay  
Got desert  people were still hungry  and the apple and rubarb only had apple and was only barely warm  The container was scalding so we assumed they used a microwave to reheat  Its a shame as the place is lovely "
R0180,Ineffiecient staff
R0180,Lovely restaurant good varied menu friendly staff 
R0180,Lovely staff  nice vibe and delicious casual dining experience  
R0180,"Not impressed with  house  especially with all the great bars around Dublin nowadays  the food was bland  and the place looks like it could do with a good clean  �I also overheard one of the staff say that If a customer walked out on a table   the owners charge the waiter/waitress   full price     �Sound   
"
R0180,Okay bar for a drink or to get dancing  but their bouncers were plain rude and kept half of our group out fragmenting the evenings pub crawl 
R0180,Overall disappointing  no music for first 2 hours  had to keep asking for drinks when running low  never asked how was our meal  never asked would we like to look at the dessert menu  We moved to quiet corner after meal but suede chairs had stains  Zero atmosphere 
R0180,Pasta was over cooked and staff were too busy  we got there at 6:45 pm and were told we had to order ASAP if we wanted the early bird  felt rushed and when I gave my drink order they ran off with out taking my friends order  he had to shout after them to come back  This was an older man with facial hair  the girls there seem to be much more friendly and more helpful 
R0180,Personally  this was a terrible experience  I was branded as a westerner as soon as I walked in the door  given a table with different setting and a different menu  However I did not notice this until after I ordered as they had just opened for lunch  A group of men came in and got the same treatment as I did but the two Chinese couples who came soon after were greeted much more warmly than us outsiders and given a more extensive menu 
R0180,"Quality Superb 
Staff super friendly 
We meet regularly as ex colleagues   always favour"
R0180,really disappointed after hearing great reviews food was excellent and let down by really slow bar service when we mentioned this to the floor staff we were told because we were so far back in the room we were forgotten about told we should have waved for staff to come to us drinks took over ten minutes to come to table dissapointed with first visit and because of this I wont return
R0180,tasty  and  fresh food  great service  super presentation  I was there with a group of friends and we all had a great evening 
R0180,The food was amazing and the servers were wonderful  My family and I truly enjoy the food and restaurant  Definitely a must when in Dublin   
R0180,The food was good but was really let down by the service 
R0180,"The food wasnt great
I wont be back but that doesnt mean I wont remember   "
R0180,The restaurant was lovely but booking with app was not worth it Id ring in future it let me book a table for 11 even though the restaurant was fully booked causing a lot of confusion and hassle will never use app again for booking anything
R0180,The service was poor   We had pre booked a table   It was a stormy cold night and when we walked in the door  the first table the waitress wanted to give us was at the door   I daid I had a bad cold and there would be a draft at the door  there were other tables available  could we have one away from the door   I had to ask more than once   There was food on the menu that was unavailable   This was disappointing and we were told after we ordered it   My mashed potatoes were lumpy and dry instead of creamy and moist   There were 4 to 5 occasions were we tried to get the attention of the waiting staff and they were looking down and were not looking around as they walked past to see if customers needed anything   I wouldnt spend my hard earned money here again 
R0180,"The venue is stunning and raised our expectations when we arrived  Unfortunately the service staff seemed inexperienced which resulted in 5 of them asking us if wed like to order dessert within 5 mins 
The food was only ok  I ordered vegetarian noodles which tastws bland and I would not order again  My friends had curry and said it ws not great  We saw one of the waitresses bring salmon to another table which looked fab and would try that next time 
Id give it another chance because the venue is so gorgeous and we spoke to manager about the service so would hope/expect an improvement there "
R0180,"Unfortunately we went here at lunchtime  in at 1 20pm and ordered at 1 25pm  I ordered a panino with spicy salame and gorgonzola   Euro 4 50  and a tea   Euro 2 00  and he ordered bruschetta   Euro 5 75  and a cappucino   Euro 2 20   A fairly simple order but since there was only one person in the kitchen we had to wait 20 minutes for our order by which time our lunch break was almost over  The panino was fairly plain  no dressing or side salad or garnish  For the price  I thought the portion was pretty small

I dont think Ill be rushing back   at least not when I am in a rush "
R0180,Unreal food and service would definitely recommend
R0180,Very disappointing night  service  and  food the night we were there  wouldnt mind but the place was very quiet that night 
R0180,Waitress who met us when we arrived was extremely rude which spoilt our meal  She told us the website was down and they hadnt received our booking which was irrelevant to us  Her whole attitude kind of spoilt the night for us despite the rest of the staff being nice 
R0180,We had a fabulous meal and fantastic service  It is a lovely restaurant  You will not be disappointed 
R0180,We had a lovely meal on Sat  The food and service was great thanks 
R0180,we Ordered 4 difference main courses which were all bland and nothing special  Second visit here and both times have been disappointing
R0180,While I appreciate hot and fresh food and the restaurant was busy   we were waiting a full hour  60 mins  for our food which I taught was to long  
R0180,Wonderful place with amazing food  very friendly and welcoming staff  I love the atmosphere 
R0181,"A pleasant experience overall  with good food and wine to the fore  is a relaxed setting 

The service was attentive and friendly  and wed certainly return "
R0181,Quite noisy but very good  and  attentive service and good food 
R0182,Great place 
R0183,Great coffee and our peach tart was delicious  �Nice place to visit and relax  Easy buffet choices and friendly servers 
R0183,"A great eating place on the Northside of the city   So close to cultural/arts venues  I was there with 2 friends for my birthday  We all opted for  the burgers which had a great variety of toppings to chose from  We spent a lot of time deciding  as all sounded great  They were delicious and we really like the home made relish and the flowery bun that it came with   You could have opted for a salad instead of the bun  A bucket of good sized chips accompanied the meal  This was my 3rd time there and cant praise it highly enough
I do feel nostalgic for the Walton Music Shop but am delighted in what they have done with the place  It has brought more life to the Square "
R0183,"choice very limited
service poor
food was luke warm
staff were obviously stretched"
R0183,Could do better
R0183,"Delicious soups  great wraps  very good granola for breakfast and very friendly staff 
Came here for soup and went back for breakfast "
R0183,Excellent food  a little find  Service great  We had the pre theatre menu  good value great taste 
R0183,Excellent food  competitively priced  great staff      beautiful setting     great atmosphere
R0183,Extremely rude staff  over priced and burnt pizza  Would not recommend if youre looking for a slice in the area 
R0183,"I dont understand why this place is getting good reviews     unless I was just unlucky   
"
R0183,"I dont like being harsh  but the food was not value for money  17/18 euro for cod and chips that left me with a knot in my stomach for a day  

Pizza option very limited  burger very expensive and cod and chips wasnt great  

The venue while interesting was dated and definitely caters for an older market 

The staff were lovely but the place could do with a good shake up  especially when there are limited options else where "
R0183,I was so disappointed with the meal   I ordered a pizza and it literally had no taste  I wondered if it was a frozen pizza  Also there were not many people there but the service was not very on the ball  they took my plate before I had finished  and gave a jug of water without glasses  The decor is very nice and there it seems very child friendly  but I would not eat the food again 
R0183,Just a great place  to dine staff were very attentive
R0183,Lovely place with staff who are always on hand  Would definitely come back again
R0183,Lovely restaurant with friendly and competent staff  Yummy food and good portion sizes  I highly recommend this place   a great experience  all around 
R0183,"Made online booking on the basis of the menu we found online 

Got to the place  were shown to a table and were given a menu that was nothing resembling the online menu and to be quite honest was abismal 

After enquiring  we were told that because it was a busy bank holiday  the menu was smaller  I said it was not smaller  it was completely different  The server then said she would bring the menu from downstairs 

It arrived and it was exactly the same menu  with an extra starter and main course 

We left without ordering 
On the subject of it being busy  there was 4/5 tables eating when we arrived  Maybe this is classed as busy by dublin standards  but we in the rest of the country are able to handle bigger tasks 

Wouldnt recommend the place to anyone based on the reception I was given by the staff "
R0183,Poor menu choice   nothing like on the website  Service very attentive but it was 5pm and we were the only ones there  Very close to a number of nearby hotels  I was disappointed overall though 
R0183,Remarkable experience with great food and service
R0183,Supposed to have a reservation for brunch menu as on the website but when we got there  some having travelled for an hour  we were told there is no brunch menu and reservation is no good 
R0183,The food was bland and overpriced 
R0183,The menu available on Saturday night was more restricted than that advertised on the website 
R0183,"Unfortunately on the evening we visited the 
service was haphazard to say the least  The menus were slow to arrive  and  there were not many other customers there  To be fair we were told that the burgers we ordered would take 20 mins to cook  We were clear that we need to be out by 7:40  and  our order was taken at 6:40  The food arrived at 7:25 giving us a very short time to eat  We ended up eating about half  and  then had to run  Its a pity because the individual staff members were really nice  and  friendly  Organisation  and  co ordination needs to be a lot better"
R0183,Very disappointed  We booked a table online for lunch expecting a sit down service  However this was not the case  On arrival we were told that lunch does not commence until 3 o clock  It was the All Ireland semi final day and management are missing out on a huge opportunity to capitalise on events going on in the local area 
R0183,Worst dining experience in a while  Wont return 
R0184,Amazing food and cozy atmosphere  The selection of ramen is quite large and the appetizers were delicious 
R0184,As usual was awesome   The best noodles in town 
R0184,Asian tachos were yum  Worst dumplings ever tasted  Really bad service  Would never go there again 
R0184,Best ever  Will be backs soon  100 percent recommended 
R0184,Best ramen Ive ever had  Amazing food  and I wish Id found this place sooner 
R0184,Chashu pork in both of our ramen bowls felt undercooked  They were not good at all  We left all of them uneaten 
R0184,"Despite the website suggesting a wide variety of gluten free options to chose from when I discussed this with the waiter he said that none of the starters were available gluten free and I had a �choice� of ONE main course  
Im celiac so need to choose venues that offer GF alternatives  An honest view on the website would have saved me a wasted trip  
I left to go somewhere else "
R0184,Excellent meal  huge portion size and good value for money 
R0184,"Food is delish    
We got a selection of starters and shared everyone enjoyed them "
R0184,Food was great      service could be better  we had multiple servers and had to wait a while for courses and drinks
R0184,Great food and warm and cozy atmosphere  Lovely for couples dinner or friends night out 
R0184,The servings of meat are really no more than a large tablespoon  so if you are a carnivore you are going to be very disappointed  �Overall the bowl lacked flavour  was very much on the wet and squishy side and was lacklustre in the extreme  �I read at the weekend that this place is currently scoping out a second location in the city centre  but I think they need to get the fundamentals right in their flagship outlet before they think of expanding  �Bottom line   not great 
R0184,I went here yesterday for brunch with a friend  We both got the tomato fondue  it was yum  Loved the chili jam that went with it had a funky taste to it but enjoyed it  Got the Bellini cocktails which were flavorsome also 
R0184,"Last week I attended another Zomato Meetup for a casual  and  chill dinner event 
 The service was attentive  and  friendly  and Mark  events coordinator  even gave us a quick tour of the hostel  showing us two types of rooms the Generator Hostel offers  The menu features all different types of burgers  of different meats and toppings  each of which recommends a specific drink to have with your chosen meal  Although the menu recommends a beer  I opted for one of the evenings cocktail; the Perfect Storm  made with spiced rum  bitters  lime and ginger beer  which was delicious 
                                "
R0184,Nice cozy atmosphere  great service and really tasty food
R0184,"Nice food   Service could have definitely been better 
We ordered Prawn gyoza and ramen noodles  The waitress took the order after a while  Then  when she served the food she had forgotten the Prawn gyoza  
Again  she brought them back after a while  
I start eating gyozas and found out there were pork gyoza  I had insisted to highlight I did not eat pork   
When we noticed this to the waitress  she disprove mentioning it was well Ebi  prawn  gyoza  We had to insist during a couple of minutes  showing her and making her bringing back the plate to the chief in the kitchen  
She came back and apologised  confirming there was well a mistake  She brought a new plate which was finally correct    Its a pity 
The ramen were good though "
R0184,Nice spot near the park
R0184,Nothing special here  We both ordered the eggs benedict which was lovely but came with nothing else to it as we were immediately hungry after an hour  Although quaint the service was meh and we were waiting to get a check longer than for our food which isnt always bad  Great that it was open on a Sunday and early  otherwise Id skip 
R0184,One of the best pizza places in Dublin  Love the fries as well they were amazing    Nice mixture of local pub and pizza placeMore
R0184,"Possibly the second worst duck Ive ever had  I asked for the classic ""Roast duck on white rice""  Three key problems: 1  the duck was cold  cardinal sin in Chinese food   2   fat was not fully rendered leaving the skin soggy 3   they over marinated the bejeezus out of it with star anise  When I asked the manager/owner he replied  ""oh its like that because it gets cold and the skin non crispy after 10 minutes  and maybe you got a bad duck"" "
R0184,"Really disappointed by the food  I was looking forward to trying The Ramen Bar for ages  I got the Seafood Ramen  It was not what i expected at all  It was Fish rather than Seafood  when i order seafood i imagine shellfish like prawns  muscles  squid and some fish  and the prawns i did get in it were tiny and barely there  The fish was dry  makes me think it was all frozen fish  and over cooked 

The noodles were really disappointing as well  over cooked and gooey  Really not a pleasant experience 

Also when my friend asked for added fresh chili she was told they dont have fresh chili which i found really bazaar 

I certainly wont be going back there in a hurry and definitely wouldnt recommend it  "
R0184,Really disappointed in this establishment  17 euro should get you more than having to ask someone to pour you ice cream  Not allowed to use the ice cream machine on your own is absolutely absurd  �Multiple meat dishes couldve have easily been dog for all I know  Do not go 
R0184,Stopped in for dinner while in Dublin with my wife  Great pint of Guinness  Food was GREAT 
R0184,Tasty  fast and fresh  Feels like home at this place  my hubby was impressed with their big breakfast
R0184,The allure of a cute Italian grocery ended for me the moment I walked in and was rudely greeted by the hostess  Thus began one of my worst experiences in restaurant service  I was pretty much ignored by my waitress the entire meal and treated like I was a bother to anyone I asked a question to  This was one of the coldest places to visit in Dublin  Food was mediocre at best  So if their adorable store front catches your eye and youre being seduced by the colorful pastry and gelato in the window    take my advice and move on     
R0184,The fish and chips were amazing  Great atmosphere and music  Staff were very friendly  We thoroughly enjoyed our visit there More
R0184,The food came out very quickly and the portions are far to big there was only two of us and there was enough food to feed between 4 6 people
R0184,This used to be my favourite restaurant in Dublin  Sadly the prices have gone up and the quality and quantity has gone down  This was a great spot to grab an affordable ramen with friends 
R0184,Very good traditional pub  Older crowd which was nice for since I came in with a family of young kids  Overall good food  drink and service  Would recommend 
R0184,Very poor wouldnt recommend  Cheapest chicken money can buy chewy and horrible  Ignorant staff watching what u ate eating and monitoring even though its all u can eat  Wouldnt give this to a dog
R0184,Was really excited as it was rated no 1 online Dublin  Honestly found it overpriced and very mediocre  Wont be going back 
R0184,We made a reservation but the  restaurant was not only closed  but looked to be out of business   Needless to say  the experience was not satisfactory   Trust is the most valuable aspect of this service and to lose that is disappointing 
R0184,We ordered gyoza  specifically asking for it as a starter   A waitress came back a few mins later to tell us they had none left  So we asked for dumplings instead  She left but again came back a couple of minutes later saying they were also out of dumplings  She then told us everything else they were sold out of  so we chose some prawns  which were still supposed to be a starter  However our two mains soon arrived but we had not received our starter  When I said this to the waiter who brought our mains he didnt seem to grasp that I was complaining that the courses were arriving in the wrong order  Instead he focused on the fact that the original starters had been unavailable  But instead of apologising he shrugged and said its Saturday night  like I should know better than to expect to receive what I order from the menu on a Saturday  the restaurant was not busy   The real issue was was a lack of competence to take the mains away until after our starter had been served and eaten  Its not hard to keep ramen hot  or reheat it before serving a few minutes later  Poor waiting staff and disappointing experience overall  I love the ramen here but am almost always let down by the service here  Not good enough when youre spending  Euro 16 50 on a bowl of ramen 
R0184,We took a bit of a punt on this one being strangers to Dublins fair city and chose it mainly for being the nearest decent restaurant to our hotel  We were not disappointed  
R0184,We were in Dublin for a long weekend anniversary celebration  We were extremely impressed with the level of service and friendliness at every restaurant we went to  We love Japanese food and enjoyed what we ordered  What we didnt enjoy was our waiter  We got to the restaurant early  about 6 pm  We were the only ones seated  There was a tall waiter who was busy talking to a female co worker a few feet away from our table  He didnt look our way   Tried to get his attention    he wouldnt look our way  You know how it is when you are really hungry and need food  We were getting agitated by his lack of service  We finally spoke up and he came over  He took our order    and it took him 20 minutes to let us know one of the two appetizers was not available  With no other diners there    why would it take so long for him to find this out  Maybe it was a one off  but maybe not     
R0185,Amazing Pizza  top quality ingredients  Will definitely be back  Great to see more delicious spots popping up
R0185,Bad food  bad service  unbelievably loud  avoid at all costs  If I could have sent a distress signal from here in order to be rescued  I would have  Alas  no one would have heard my cries for help  What a bad meal  Blech 
R0185,booked early bird but given regular menu waitress had to ask boss was it ok for us to have EB Awkward
R0185,Fun atmosphere  I went on a Friday night and they had entertaining live music along with great pub food  drink  and  service 
R0185,Great service  excellent food   good menu selection
R0185,I would visit again but only for a coffee and maybe dessert  in between shopping  The food wasnt great   it looked good  on the menu and on the plate  but tested bland  There were 6 of us and we almost all had something different  and all of us had the same opinion 
R0185,If Im not dead now  I will be dead in a few days from the sheer amount of disgustingness this food is  Straight from the freezer  and dont get me started on the chicken tenders  It should be a crime to get chicken tenders as small and as bad as the ones I got  What did those poor chickens ever do to you
R0185,Lovely for a quiet  yet atmospheric lunch  We had the open coronation chicken sandwiches    delicious taste and presentation 
R0185,Lovely restaurant on the top floor  Gorgeous decor and great food  A lovely experience 
R0185,"My friends and I went  the food was a major let down  The sandwiches were minuscule  as were the deserts and scones  

The one positive was the staff  they were extremely attentive "
R0185,Poor experience  Booked table for brunch at 11 30am on 16th Dec but restaurant didnt open the doors until 11 45 due to a private function   surely this was know when we made the booking  Waited over an hour from ordering until the food arrived   had to ask three separate members of staff to check where the food was  When the food arrived  one of the meal was not as ordered but unfortunately we did not have another hour to wait for this meal to be corrected  Overall a very poor experience
R0185,Poor quality  little love in this restaurant and very overpriced  We had chicken Milanese and it was tough and lacking flavour  Disappointed considering the price
R0185,Service was terrible  Staff were rude   Music was awful  and  the speaker was directly over our table and the food was average  Overall very disappointing
R0185,Staff were lovely but we were told when we sat down there was a 15min wait for food  But we were waiting over an hour and the restaurant was only half full  The person next to us got his food in 10min and he ordered after us  There were a lot of unhappy customers in there this morning 
R0185,"The food was alright but the service was very poor
And the waiter was very rude 
The price of a soft drinks was 2 50 and I ordered coke a cola and my friends orderd 7up and club orange 
There glass bottles of drink were clearly larger then my coke so I asked the waiter about it he said the its just the way we get them so I asked him is it still the same price and he walked away and said yes without looking at me  When I got my food with was the supreme nachos at the bottom of it was a pool of grease 
Although my friends food was alright I
Did not enjoy it"
R0185,The menu was not the menu I called to confirm  There is no breakfast menu on Saturdays which I specifically called and asked about  The food we ordered was not the food that came out  There was no lemon crud or ricotta with the pancakes  mint with the porridge or passion fruit with the tropical food platter  When asked for lemon crud we were given a slice of lemon 
R0185,The restaurant was almost empty but there was no record of our booking  The starters was great  but the main course  which 3 of 4 of us chose  was a charred fresh Tuna salad  The smell of the tuna was overpower  awful  The service was slow and unfocused  In our reservation we said we were pre theatre and must be out by a certain time  We ended up virtually eating our meal as we went out the door  And bizarrely  the meal was one euro per head more expensive as advertised when we  made the booking  The one euro was not particularly the issue but the random change was strange and unexplained 
R0185,"Very poor choice on menu   check on line before you go 

So limited I asked for the full menu   Starters were really only Tasters 

Only one desert"
R0185,Was in here twice for dinner in recent weeks  and experienced service so bad the first time I assumed it must have been a one off  Unfortunately on the return visit I discovered this was not the case  Food ranges from good to mediocre  had a very nice pizza and lasagne  desserts both time were poor  but the service was so bad as to ruin the meal  We arrived at seven for an early dinner before grabbing a drink and seeing a 9 20 film  However  it was so slow that we barely got out at 9 having had a main and a dessert  there were only three of us  and had to wave down staff to order  to follow up on food and to pay to such an extent that we spend the second half of the meal anxious about making the film  This was my second trip  the first was in a large group which I assumed explained why it took so long to bring our food and bill 
R0185,Was waiting around one hour there  and a cake is oily
R0185,Went for afternoon tea  they have special teas that are quite delicious  we had a lovely time  I must comment on the hostess  we arrived about 15 min late because we miscalculated the time to get from the airport to hotel to here  and the hostess was wonderfully understanding  We highly recommend 
R0185,Wouldnt be rushing back to be honest  Afternoon tea itself wasnt bad  poor reservation service  I had booked a table a month in advance and had received confirmation  A week before the reservation date  I received a call from the restaurant requesting to push out the booking for an hour as they have overbooked  I emailed afterwards saying thats not possible as some of us have travel plans  No response so presumed it was okay  A day before the reserved date I got another call from the restaurant which lasted 18 minutes requesting details I had already provided and  credit card details to secure the booking  They charge 50 EUR per person for no shows while the afternoon tea is only 30 EUR per person which made no sense  I provided the details anyway as it was Easter weekend and everywhere else was busy and my friend really wanted to go  personally I wasnt bothered at all at that stage with the cumbersome reservation processes  The afternoon itself was not bad  savoury options were great  sweet options could be better  The restaurant was not at all busy that day as I can see empty tables everywhere so couldnt really understand why the excessive phone calls were about
R0186,A wonderful  dining experience food was fab  Service first rate
R0186,Excellent food  staff were very friendly  Excellent service 
R0186,Fantastic food  Great service
R0186,Fantastic service and food  So good we returned 2 nights in a row 
R0186,Great Music and The Best Fish and Chips Ive ever had and I live in a Seacoast Tourist Town  The staff there were Excellent 
R0186,I understand that operational glitches happen at restaurants  however the severity of this incident could have been avoided if our waitress merely checked in with our table AT ALL  For a restaurant of this price point and prestige Im SHOCKED that such an event can occur  Its pretty simple: servers should regularly check in with their table  not force customers to desperately flag them down  This restaurant ruined my parents impression of the Dublin food scene  
R0186,Incredible risotto  very nice atmosfere and service  Highly recommend 
R0186,It took almost an hour to receive out main course  We didnt order starters  Bread was served to all other tables around bar us  When asked about our main course after about 40mins there was no apology just told it was on its way  To wait another 10 15mins    When received chips were under cooked  greasy and soggy  veg was tasteless  We had to rush eating food as we were on our way to a gig which is never a pleasant dining experience 
R0186,Lovely evening  From greeting at the door to the service  the food all was great  Balieys Creme was delicious  Thanks to Ziggy and all the staff 
R0186,Second time eating here just as amazing as the first   Food is SO EXCELLENT   A must try   Every dish was perfection 
R0186,The best dish in the main course was the jack Daniel fries  Must try 
R0186,The food is excellent but the service is horrible   Couple sat down next to us and was served way before us  Not cool
R0186,The service was second to none and the live music a treat  really enjoyed our visit and would highly recommend  and happy days  just a short stroll 
R0186,The vegetable soup was wonderful   Risotto was bland and Christmas pudding was awful 
R0186,This is the next restaurant in Dublin that will receive a Michelin star  absolutely no doubt at all 
R0186,Would try again but in no massive hurry  may have been slightly underwhelmed by the hype of the brand 
R0187,Lovely food and good service 
R0187,Excellent food and service 
R0187,Fab food excellent service went for early bird menu as much better value
R0187,Fabulous dining experience as always  Best in Dublin
R0187,Fantastic experience from the moment we entered  Will definitely we back 
R0187,Fantastic lunch  cant wait to return  A special place
R0187,Great experience  Outstanding seafood options 
R0187,Food and service on point 
R0187,My guests  and  I had a great time  Everything was excellent from the service to the food  and  wine 
R0187,Really enjoyed Sunday lunch here  Will be back  Wine  food and service was excellent 
R0187,The service was amazing and the food was incredible  Well worth the visit 
R0187,We enjoyed a very nice 3 course lunch  and  found the service so friendly  and  efficient
R0187,Wonderful service and cuisine  Beautiful setting  A marvelous choice 
R0187,Never again shall I miss to visit here and I dont know why its always so amazing 
R0187,5 tasteless prawns  Euro 19 says it all  Waiters were great 
R0187,"A  bad burrito place  
The actual food is fairly tasteless and the burritos just taste like a big bland mash 
The rice is usually dry  No chipotle sauce usually  

However they offer big portions 

The bathrooms are pretty shit to be fair "
R0187,A disappointing meal  We went as a pre Christmas treat and the ambience was not the least bit Christmassy   Food was fine but not worth  Euro 70 per head  Service was assiduous but seemed focused on topping up our wine glasses and encouraging us to go for another bottle   It was interesting to see the this place  at Christmas   We now know we are not missing anything special so we will go elsewhere in future 
R0187,A great experience on our last night in Ireland  very enjoyable Birthday Dinner 
R0187,A great meal was had by all three of us for my mum inlaws birthday  Table in a nice quiet area   Nothing was to much trouble my mum inlaw forgot to bring her reading glasses and the kind waiter supplied her with a selection to chose from  The food from starter to main course was delicious and my mum inlaw was surprised with a small platter and a candle  for her birthday and the waiter sang as I had mentioned while booking it was her birthday  This has been our second time there its a real treat highly recommend
R0187,A very special experience  beautiful  food and prompt friendly service 
R0187,A very special experience  Amazing food and service  Such an amazing restaurant 
R0187,Absolutely beautiful in all respects  5 star food and treatment
R0187,Absolutely delicious lunch for exceptional value  Highly recommended 
R0187,"Absolutely superb  Unmatched in Dublin   Equals finest in Paris 

"
R0187,after 5 visits to this establishment i can say that it is consistently achieving excellence in food standards  presentation and service all of which are top notch and for an extremely attractive price    lunch is still just 19 95 for 2 courses  23 95 for 3  Very highly recommended  need to book as this place is now hugely popular especially on a saturday lunchtime 
R0187,Amazing venue  Flew in from the UK to dine here  Some of the key dishes on the menu not available  The main we had  steak to share   Sides under cooked and poor standard  Was a big let down 
R0187,Amazing food  attentitive service superb value for money
R0187,Amazing service  Really nice touches for a celebration 
R0187,Anniversary party ruined cause of lack of attention 
R0187,Anniversary dinner  Ok food
R0187,Another excellent meal  in a wonderful restaurant   Always a special occasion 
R0187,Another fabulous meal   never disappoints   Already looking forward to the next time 
R0187,"As with Clarenece  the crime of booking at 9:30   poor service   Waiters more keen to clean up and go home   This evident by the manager taking the desert citing ""I cant seem to find your waiter"" after a 15 minute wait   Chef youre food was excellent but the service made for a very frustating experience   At least they remembered to return my credit card unlike to poor gentleman to my left  He waited as they tried to find his waiter  A bit expensive too "
R0187,At an expensive restaurant I expected steak to be excellent; however  it was very tough   very disappointing 
R0187,"Ate here with a friend on Sat 21st December  The only menu available was the ""Festive Menu"" which was  Euro 65 per person  I had looked up the menu online before going  and it did not mention this  had I know I would most definitely not have booked as the menu was very restricted  Very ordinary food  for example starters included soup  smoked salmon  prawn cocktail etc  We both had the steak for main which was nice  and the dessert was nice  but for that price I was looking for ""Wow"" food  and we certainly didnt get it  The restaurant itself is comfortable  but so are alot of other restaurants nearby  and I know we could have gotten better food at a better price elsewhere "
R0187,Beautiful food  lovely warm staff  gorgeous setting and great prices  We had Saturday three course lunch with the whole family  Food was outstanding  everyone went home happy  Lovely  relaxed atmosphere  Highly recommend 
R0187,Booked lunch for 2 15  advised dining room at 1 40 that we were in the bar  they said they would call us when the table was ready 2 35 had to ask the bar staff if we could go in Seated 2 55  first course arrived 15 minutes later  It has a lot going for it  the food was fine but the service leaves a lot to be desired 
R0187,By far 1 of the worst chips
R0187,"Chateaubriand was not cooked as requested; didnt want to wait for a ""do over""   No special attention given to the fact that it was a special dinner  birthday  and they had been notified in advance   Great atmosphere and acceptable service for that class of restaurant   Would I go back   Maybe  but Id try some of the other 5 star places first   not that there are that many   Like I said previously  you dont go to IRELAND for the food   Its mostly pub grub "
R0187,Check your bill  We were astounded to find that we were being excessively overcharged  We were a party of 7 ladies at lunch last Wednesday  When the bill arrived I thought it was expensive compared to other years at the this place   However on checking the bill I was horrified to find that they were charging us for 14 lunches instead of 7  More worryingly we met an acquaintance on the way out who was similarly overcharged in that their bill was also for 14 lunches while there was only 10 of them  Shocking really   Needless to say we complained but no major response from management  We have since telephoned the this place  and are waiting on a call back  While the food was good and at the correct price  of good value  the overall experience has put us off going back next year  Service was of the standard expected but response from management regarding the bill was way below acceptable   Disappointing to say the least on this occasion
R0187,Chose this for lunch on a special occasion and found the menu very limited  No steak as on web sample menu and indeed no specials 
R0187,Consistently good food  excellent staff and a great atmosphere
R0187,Definitely will return again  cannot fault the food  service or experience 
R0187,Delicious food and wine  The service staff were friendly and knowledgeable 
R0187,Delicious food  excellent service and a lovely atmosphere in luxurious settings  Will return
R0187,Delicious food  excellent service and a lovely atmosphere in luxurious settings  Will return 
R0187,Disappointed
R0187,"Disappointed with lack of roast beef dish in main menu  Bar menu had burger and that was it 
I would go to Bar 27 next time where there are very good staff and there is better atmosphere "
R0187,Disappointing and overpriced menu  staff very friendly
R0187,Disappointing for a special treat  probably best to leave it for the overnight guests 
R0187,Disappointing   Had booked as a birthday treat   We were brought to a room off the main dining room  which had no atmosphere  and were placed at a table beside an air conditioning unit which was very cold  We moved no problem  Then a fire drill closed the kitchen   understandable alright  but this made us late for our appointment which then lead to other problems   And when I checked the bill later  it had been done incorrectly   Disappointing for a special treat  probably best to leave it for the overnight guests 
R0187,"Disgraceful rudeness from girl at the front door  I asked for a better table given we were in the middle of two very large tables with most of the guests having had a lot of wine and cocktails  I was told ""Dont be Stupid""  Other than I was bringing a client I would have walked "
R0187,discreet excellent service  quiet comfortable and lovely surroundings and an excellent vegitarian meal   full marks 
R0187,Dont waste your time  They dont take reservations but for very large groups  and then you have to pay a deposit ahead  The wait on a Friday night was 2 hours for a table  We were able to get a table in the upstairs area  but the menu is limited  I guess what they serve is called tapas  but unlike any tapas Ive ever had at a Spanish tapas bar  The food was greasy and drinks overpriced  I cant speak to the food downstairs 
R0187,Embarrassingly poor service overall   this may be due to the fact that we were mainly served by a waitress in training      Euro 13 for a very nice glass of wine only filled one third of the way to the line   a pity really as apart from  this lovely food and nice atmosphere    
R0187,"Enjoyed it  Will be back 

Was a bit loud near the kitchen   Big table of guests behind us"
R0187,Excellent and consistently excellent  Always a pleasure

R0187,Expected more from this restaurant   The oven roasted turbot was not cooked   We sent it back  and  it was returned drowning in butter   Horrible   It was disappointing that a restaurant of this caliber couldnt deliver

R0187,Fantastic venue in a fantastic city 
R0187,"First complements to the chef   the food was very good but that where it ends   
Unfortunately we were seated in an area where there were Rugby supporters who were drunk  loud and totally inappropriate and unbecoming of the venue   We were uncomfortable and distracted and requested to be moved   which thankfully was facilitated  
The service was at best mediocre and slow at times  
It was my sons 21st Birthday and despite advance notice and a promise that it would be acknowledged  it was never mentioned   
Overall disappointing evening  "
R0187,First time  and  will definitely revisit  Had a great night  great food  and  great wine  Waiting staff were exceptional especially the lovely man from Hungary  Would highly recommend for a special occasion 
R0187,First time dining and we will definitely be returning  The food was fabulous and the service was great  Our server was exceptional and really made our night even more enjoyable  I would highly recommend 
R0187,First time in Dublin  Lamb was delicious 
R0187,"food disapointing as provenance of ingrediants looked interesting but cooking just ok  their back stage was a bit poor in the lounge as a manager was asking a new waitress ""well what have you learned today"" but it is a great hotel and the seafood bar may be a better bet as i had a great meal there 2 years ago and you can take in the buzz in the hotel better "
R0187,Food is fantastic and everyone was so nice  Make sure you have a reservation 
R0187,The wine steward actually yelped out loud and physically corrected him at a nearby table when he began to use the decanter backwards      There is no reason or excuse for untrained staff in an expensive restaurant  The service was bad enough to distract and impair the meal 
R0187,Food quality was fine but the service was very poor  Our waiter was friendly but untrained  He didnt know how to time his interruptions  pour wine  or do basic service that youd expect in a restaurant of this price range  with wine the meal was  Euro 275   
R0187,Food staff ambience    couldnt fault anything    what an experience   we will be back
R0187,"Food was beautifully presented and very tasty
Staff were so helpful and well attentive"
R0187,Food was incredible and service was fantastic   Best meal while we were in Dublin 
R0187,Food was not up to expectations  I had fish and the meal lacked flavour; my partner had chicken and it it was unexceptional  Goats cheese slad started was also disappointing  again lacked flavour 
R0187,"found it very hard to choose from al la carte menu  to much fish on all the courses 
The food we ordered was very expensive 143 00Euro for basically steak chips onions ring and a bottle of wine 2 starters and 1 dessert not good value  extremely quiet no back round music 
The service was very good a male waiter will lots of tips  Would never go back "
R0187,Friendly service  lovely relaxed atmosphere  great value set menu  beautiful food  Perfect
R0187,Generally disappointing at the price point and service was inattentive   not great   not bad              just good  
R0187,Good food   Ambience poor   Bill had extra bottle of wine on it   Not happy  
R0187,Gorgeous food  impeccable service  superb value for money 
R0187,Great ambience  food and wine in a delightful setting 
R0187,Great experience which I would recommend to a friend  especially the main course
R0187,Great food and great service   thanks Alexandra   We no doubt will return  again 
R0187,Great food excellent lobster super night would recommend any day
R0187,Great food  great service
R0187,Great for business dining  superb food  wine list and service  Lovely ambience 
R0187,Great Good  staff were outstanding  definitely worth a visit  we are booking again soon 
R0187,Great meal  really enjoyed it  The staff could not do enough for you 
R0187,Great night great food and service well worth the money  Nice way to celebrate a special occasion
R0187,Great portions and excellent service  Nicest hotel we have ever stayed in 
R0187,Great resturant and Jasmine our waitress was amazing
R0187,Great service and attention to detail   Food was delicious 
R0187,Great service  great food and very comfortable ambience  Recommended
R0187,Great spot for a special occasion  The food was outstanding and service excellent
R0187,Had a birthday lunch here today  All the staff were friendly and the food was delicious as always  Would highly recommend 
R0187,"Had a lovely lunch  only to be let down by poor customer service  The food was very good and the staff were attentive  A lovely setting by the window to watch the world go by   

Unfortunately I was left disappointed after having a drink in the bar   I noticed on my credit card two days later that I had been charged twice for my drink  When I spoke with the bar manager I was told the it was not the this place  s policy to issue a refund without a receipt  When I contacted my bank I was able to prove that there were two transactions  when I only authorised one   Eventually the money was refunded one week later  

I felt that I was not listened too by the bar manager who kept referring to the hotel policy of not issuing refunds without a receipt  All I was asking for was the the matter to be looked into   It was not until I got my bank involved that the issue was resolved which is a pity considering the hotel prides itself on a high standard of  customer service "
R0187,Had a lovely lunch with some friends  Very attentive server  Lovely atmosphere
R0187,Had a lovely meal here on Sunday night  Staff so helpful and friendly  Highly recommend 
R0187,Had a lovely meal  lovely ambiance and staff were very friendly and attentive 
R0187,Had the Christmas set menu   Felt it was poor value for money   Bland starter and dessert   Steak was good but had to pay extra for sides  3 courses no wine included wasnt worth the cost of 90 a head   Very disappointing 
R0187,Highly Disappointed
R0187,Highly recommend this amazing restaurant  fancier than the local pub  very historical  incredible service and the FOOD IS EXCEPTIONAL      Adventures on a plate   LOVED  will be back 
R0187,I thought it would be a nice idea for the Family to cerebrate my Husbands Birthday there   The ambience was very nice and we were able to have a lovely conversation without loud music which we enjoy   Sadly it was the food that let the Restaurant down for a well renowned Hotel like the this place  that has dealt in Catering for many many years this was very disappointing especially that there are so many other lovely restaurants in Dublin that people would choose with better food and less pricey 
R0187, Very disappointing especially that there are so many other lovely restaurants in Dublin that people would choose with better food and less pricey 
R0187,I booked months ago and was ok with price of menu but very disappointed when I realised it was over twice the price just because it was a festive menu  certainly not worth what we paid  Euro 400 for four people excluding drinks
R0187,"I booked the pre theatre menu on Sunday  and  was confirmed by phone and email on 7th December  The email confirmation contained this place evening menu which I reviewed ahead of Sunday  I was given the ""festive"" menu which  to my surprise  was  Euro 52 for 3 courses  I questioned this and was informed that the menu changed on 5th December  There had been no mention if this anywhere on the website  nor in the email menu I was sent 
This is false advertising and the hotel merely taking advantage of its reputation to overcharge patrons  I phoned the hotel Monday with my complaint and spoke with Andre  He told me that the website should have had the new menu details and he would ask someone to check it out  I have heard nothing back "
R0187,I came here from Toronto and was so excited to try out this place  Im glad I did because the pie was amazing  I got the beef Guinness pie and loved it 
R0187,"I dont understand why this place is getting good reviews     unless I was just unlucky   
Do yourselves a favour and bring your burrito "
R0187,I found it an absolute rip off at  Euro 85 for three courses of good but not exceptional food   There is much better value to be found in Dublin
R0187,I had a wonderful meal with my aunt  The ambiance  the food  the service was exquisite  I highly recommend this restaurant you will not be disappointed 
R0187,"I had lunch here a few months back and it was absolutely amazing  I am vegan and its hard to get such delicious good quality food so I thought this would be the perfect venue to take my sister for her birthday as a special treat  
I was really disappointed with the dinner  I ordered the pickled vegetable salad for starters which I was really excited about as I had it for lunch before    however   the dinner version was absolutely miniscule  
For my mains I ordered something along the lines of rosti onion with seasonal veg and an almond crumb    there were 4 tiny roast onions on the plate  some beetroot puree and about 5 tiny carrots in the middle of the plate    no sign of any almond crumb   I was starving   
To add insult to injury the waitress then informed me that the only vegan desert options were fruit salad or sorbee    at this point I was absolutely starving so ended up ordering a non vegan desert as I dread to think what the fruit salad was going to be "
R0187,I had not visited the this place  for lunch for a few years  at least since it changed name  I have to say that on this experience it has certainly not been improved  The setting  reception and welcome were superb but things went wrong from there  Although the restaurant was only about half full the service was very slow  the waiter did not know which wines he had and served a different wine from one that was ordered  The first course was cooked badly and sent back to the kitchen and overall the attention to detail seemed to be missing 
R0187,I had the full Irish breakfast  Best I had so far while touring Ireland  Nice clean spot with good service  Will come again    
R0187,"I have eaten in this place a hand full of times   I like the ambiance  We waited to be seated as the maitred was busy with a phone query It was a long time before our order was taken We both had French onion soup  excellent My main course was turkey and ham  not hot and not tasty My friend left most of the chicken on her plate  We could not wait for dessert as time was marching on  2 hrs  There were plenty waiting staff but service was patchy  A wedding party had arrived crowding the area where we were sitting 
I probably will eat in this place again  but I do not have high expectations of either food or service There is a very careless approach to the customer  I was disappointed as it was a treat for my friends birthday "
R0187,I have never eaten here before and I would highly recommend it  The staff are extremely friendly and courteous  The food is exquisite  I look forward to returning to your restaurant in the near future and I have already told some of my friends  family and work colleagues about it 
R0187,I highly recommend the lunch menu  I took my Mum there on Saturday the 5th of February  One of the few places  actually catering to people who want lunch on a Saturday  The food was really beautiful  and  such good value   Euro 19 99 for two courses  and   Euro 23 99 for 3 courses  The deserts are amazing  The service was excellent  also We were made very welcome  and  thoroughly enjoyed the experience  only one fault  a bottle of still water is expensive 
R0187,I often eat at 5 star restaurants and this what I was expecting at this place    Certainly the atmosphere is good but I would say the service is only just acceptable for the price range we are dealing with here   I would say the food is well below what I expected   A starter comprising 4 tiny scallops for 21 euro  a small main course for 37 euro   It all seemed over priced and inadequate to me   I would have been quite happy to pay the prices if the food was up to the standard I expect but it isnt  not in quality and certainly not in quantity or presentation   The servers were pleasant but the restaurant was less than half full and yet the attention I expect certainly was not adequate   I would not eat there again and I certainly would not recommend this restaurant   The standards are too low 
R0187,I specifically booked the restaurant after looking at the menu on the app as to treat my friend to Lobster for her birthday as I do every year  When we arrived we were just offered a set menu for  Euro 90  We were extremely disappointed and felt mislead showing a different menu  The light was very low and the menu text quite faint  we ask for a little more time to pick and we were told quite abruptly that we couldnt as the  kitchen was closing soon  10 minutes after we arrived  
R0187,Our server throughout the meal was extremely rude  not what you would expect for a 5 start establishment 
R0187,I think the meat here is overrated  it is not bad  but its not as good as it sounds on web 
R0187,I took 3 family members here for Sunday lunch  I have to say I found the experience very disappointing  The food was average  The menu was not very imaginative and the quality was mediocre  It was the service  however that was most lacking  Our waitress was poorly trained and was unable to offer any explanation of the menu items  She also failed to provide a wine list  and by the time I finally secured one  our starters had arrived  After our main course  we waited so long for the staff to take our dessert order that I finally gave up and went in search of someone to give me the bill  For a premium restaurant located in Dublins leading hotel  I can only assume that they have become complacent  Dublin has much better to offer  go elsewhere 
R0187,I was disappointed with the experience we had  Felt waiting service must be on commission for the amount of water and drinks they can supply a table  We requested one bottle of water  a second was automatically left at the tabel which was served however we pay for  We ordered a bottle of champagne  while it was being poured a second waiter was asking us what wine we required  We had a 3 course meal  mince pies we served with our coffee  which we were later charged  Euro 12 for  The sea food platter saved the day  our booth was ideal  our final bill was over charge by  Euro 60  had to collect my own coat from the closet when leaving   we had spent our money at that stage  bad taste in my mouth leaving 
R0187,I was disappointed with the food as I did not think it was not up to the usual standard 
R0187,"I was entertaining a client  who hadnt been there since the this place  r openend  so I chose this place as I expected it to be buzzing with activity as our booking was for a Friday afternoon lunch   the restaurant was eerily quiet  The service was prompt and very friendly when we had any dealings with them  but because we were at the back of the restaurant which was empty  we were left waiting to get their attention on a few occassions 
The food was ok  if a little boring   My client was unimpressed and I can see why   the whole experience was overpriced and disappointing  We were asked if we enjoyed our meal which I appreciated but given I was inviting the client I didnt feel appropriate to complain there and then"
R0187,I was guest in the  Hotel for a two night stay with my girlfriend  On one of the nights we took a dinner   We really enjoyed the excellent service and the world class food  Definately one of the hotspots of Dublin and highly recommended 
R0187,I was here very recently and I was utterly disappointed  Rude staff   they took a while  to take our order and than the wait was so much longer  service 1/10  The food tasted so processed  Wont be back 110 percent sure
R0187,I went to this place with my wife about 2 months ago and we enjoyed it  We took my parents there for Sunday lunch and it was dissapointing  It started off well and the service was good but after our starters we were waiting about 30 mins for our main course  Also it states on the menu that the beef is carved at the table  because of the delay  it came on the plate instead which was dissapointing as that was one of the reasons for going and my parents were looking forward to it  I had the pork main course which when arrived was very dry as it was probably resting under the lights while waiting on the beef  The waiter did apologise but afterwards he asked us was it worth the wait  unprofessional  An offer of free dessert/wine perhaps  
R0187,"I would have liked to hear some background Christmas music and see some more festive decorations  
The desserts were disappointing  tasteless and shop bought 
The bottled water was overly priced at 8Euro per bottle "
R0187,I would highly recommend  We had a fantastic 3 course lunch on Saturday afternoon  We couldnt fault the food or service  and thoroughly enjoyed each course 
R0187,If I am honest I was a bit disappointed with the food against the cost of it   The seafood platter was not very good  the selection was poor  we did not enjoy the Oysters or the Prawns  the lobster was a little overcooked   Hard to say exactly why  but I have had a lot better in other places in the past   Service and ambience were very good  but I just felt it was a bit disappointing on the food side of things 
R0187,It was amazing food  and great value  I will definately recommend this place and I will be back
R0187,Its my go to for any occasion  Food and service  excellent as always  The lamb was particularly good 
R0187,Just delicious in every way
R0187,Knowledgeable staff   delicious food and relaxing enjoyable time
R0187,Loved having lunch there  Food was fab  Will be back 
R0187,Loved the hotel but didnt like the food at all   Service very good though 
R0187,Loveky long leisurely lunch   in a booth  Have eaten in here many times and never disappointed
R0187,Lovely experience  Great food and excellent service  Would highly recommend
R0187,Lovely food  great staff  nice atmosphere  good menu
R0187,Lovely food lovely fast efficient service lovely staff great experience all round  Would highly recommend for any occasion Thanks for a lovely day
R0187,Lovely food  Very attentive service  Pork belly was divine
R0187,Lovely Hotel  The food is overpriced for what you are getting 
R0187,Lovely lunch  excellent service  and  wonderful chilled atmosphere  so nice not to be rushed  
R0187,Lovely relaxed atmosphere   Came with family  and  could chat away   Excellent food and service   Would highly recommend   Will be back  
R0187,"Lovely restaurant 
Staff lovely 
Food fantastic"
R0187,Main course fine  other two courses not up to standard of previous visits  soup very bad  Served by at least four different waiting staff  No match to two previous visits  Standards should be the same even when very busy 
R0187,My fiance took me here for my birthday dinner and we availed of the pre theatre dinner menu  and it was exceptional  The food was exquisite and the total bill came to  Euro 95 which was superb value for two three course meals  a glass of wine and a coffee  The entire ambiance was perfect   and we felt so welcomed and comfortable   The restaurant also surprised me with a birthday plate of petit fours with a candle  From the moment we walked in the door the staff were exceptionally attentive and friendly without being overpowering  Special thanks to Sandra who looked after us so well  we really had such a lovely evening and highly recommend   Thank you so much for such a wonderful experience and we will definitely be back again 
R0187,"My self  and  my wife dinned here on 6 4 19 it was our 3rd weeding anniversary we had last dinned here 2 years ago  but it is not the same restaurant that it was 2 years ago  This is not silver 5 star service that it was 2 years ago it is clear that he staff are not trained correctly  and  management has changed  It still has the same interiors  and  this is fantastic but the restaurant was not very busy on a Saturday night as we seen several empty tables  This with the fact I could get a table much easier than 2 years ago should have let me know what was to come  
We got there early  and  had drinks in the bar which is really nice we had a 9pm sitting  and  we sat at around 8 55  All was fine we placed our orders etc    but then when I looked around we could see tables not cleared empty bottles in windows etc   we were a little surprised as last time tables were been ironed  and  crumbs removed between courses with a knife  We got our starters  and  I ordered a bottle of white wine  this was poured  and  bottle placed in ice bucket well away from table  ok but I would have preferred to be in control of when I could top up my wine  15 20 miniutes in I wanted a refill my glass was empty I presumed waiter might notice but after another 10 miniutes he did not  I then had to ask him to top me up which he did  at this stage our mains arrived for me beef   mash  and  cauliflour beef was fine  but cauliflour was way too wet with far too much water left in container  mash seemed fine until I found a piece of cling film plastic in the middle of it  i removed  and  said nothing a bit shocked but thought ok it can happen  then again my wine was empty  and  I wanted another top up  I waited another 10 15 miniutes could not even get a waiters attension  and  our waiter had gone awol I got the attention of another waiter who topped up my wine at this stage I did complain  and  showed him the clingfilim he said sorry  and  removed and  left  About 5 miniutes latter a supervisor came  and  asked us if everything was alright  I said not really  and "
R0187,My son who lives in Canada was home to celebrate his 35th birthday so I wanted to do something special  The place did not disappoint   Food was amazing  EVERYBODY loved their meals   The staff were extremely friendly and courteous   The whole experience was wonderful and I would highly recommend it 
R0187,My sons graduation  Wonderful service and food  Really lovely setting
R0187,My wife and I dined at this place on 1st October  The food was quite good however the service was very poor and that is being complimentary  We felt that we were not regarded as a customer and rather an inconvenience  Unfortunately having travelled half way around the world to dine at the hotel I am unable to recommend 
R0187,Myself  and  a group of friends went for lunch and drinks and had lovely time Sunday  Food was good  and  the band were amazing  Great vibe
R0187,Myself and 3 friends dined here on Sat night Food was amazing  We all had the Chateaubriand with two sides fantastic Had house red and it was very good We will all be back here  Highly recommend
R0187,"Myself and my wife were treating ourselves to a special evening and thoroughly enjoyed our meal here  From the minute we arrived we were superbly treated by the staff  They were very attentive to all our needs throughout the whole service 
The food was above our expectations and we loved every course served to us  We couldnt find any fault with the whole evening and we would highly recommend this restaurant to friends and family  A truly 5* experience "
R0187,Nice plays to relaxing and eat dinner good atmosphere
R0187,Nice surroundings  and  food was tasty except for my wifes steak being undercooked  and  dessert unexpectedly containing cinnamon  The service was appalling  surprising  given how expensive it was  We had to wait ages in between courses  had to re request drinks that had been forgotten  and  were basically ignored for the entire evening until we ordered coffee at the same time as dessert  making the point that we didnt fancy waiting another 45 mins after dessert to be asked if we wanted any  We wont be back 
R0187,No stone was left unturned by the impeccable staff  Highly recommended if youre in and around the Dublin area or want something very special for that one off night  The staff couldnt have done more for us  The food was on another level and everybody left extremely happy  Im just sorry I under tipped them by mistake  But Ill be back 
R0187,Not so good burger  �Felt a little rushed on a Friday night   for no reason  �Not the right place for fish and chips   weird small filet cuts 
R0187,Oh Dear Lord those noodles are tasty
R0187,On arrival in the restaurant  we were exactly on time  we were told our table wasnt ready  and  were offered a seat  at the bar  were we sat for about 5 min  when we were brought to our table we waited easily 10 mins before anyone came to take a drinks order   Got to say the staff throughout the hotel were  overall   the standard of service was pretty poor  and  not  at all what we expected from a hotel of this calibre    However the steaks we had were excellent  even though there was a mix up with our order  and  we were brought the wrong ones with the wrong side dishes  So our overall verdict : food is good however standard of service leaves a lot to be desired  and  we will NOT be rushing back
R0187,One of my favorite restaurant in Dublin city center  food was excellent  service was great  we went for a early bird  Euro 35 for 3 course  everything we just love it  we had a great time there every time   Highly recommended for everyone 
R0187,Only got drinks and bread after the starter was half way through  For the 90 per person the food was not fantastic   The cheese for dessert was freezing  It should always be out of the fridge  at least an hour before service   Told the staff   Not worth the money   Never again
R0187, Not worth the money   Never again
R0187,Our first visit here and very disappointed  We were stuck in between a group of three and a group of four and it was extremely difficult to have a conversation with the noise levels either side  Our waiter was very poor  I had to ask for a refill of water every time 
R0187,My husband had a steak and only got asked did he want a steak knife was he was nearly finished  There was very little choice on the menu and defintely not worth 90 euro each 
R0187,Our meal was a disappointing affair  The service was slow and when the food came to our table it was cold  Dining room was cramped which made private conversation impossible  Wine list was badly depleted  Very surprised at the this place  
R0187,"Outstanding value and great service  Myself and four friends went for lunch on Wednesday  We were greeted with a smile from a really friendly and pleasant restaurant manager  She took our coats and showed us to a lovely round table  Our waiter was amazing and asked if we were celebrating a special occasion  We said no but he nonetheless brought us a decorated plate of macaroons at the end of our meal with ""Happy Reunion"" written on the plate in chocolate  This was such a lovely touch and very much appreciated  The lunch menu was fabulous and the service even better  We loved it and would highly recommend a visit  Thank you  You all are amazing  "
R0187,Overall a lovely experience  The staff and food are excellent in this restaurant 
R0187,"Overall disappointed  Restaurant overheated and tables too close together  Bread served cold  starter presentation unfinished  Main course fair  Mince pie served cold  poor pastry and very  little filling    5* price but not 5*quality 
  "
R0187,"Overall disappointed  Restaurant overheated and tables too close together  Main course fair     
  "
R0187,Overall I was disappointed with the experience  The waitress who took our orders had difficulty in getting it right  came back to go through the whole thing again and then a gentleman who appeared to be in charge came back again and asked us to go through the orders again  As not everyone wanted starters he appeared a little put out by this Whilst the food was tasty I felt the portions were a little small  given that they were not accompanied by anything all veg and potatoes were extra  I feel the pricing of 23 euro for 2 courses and 27 euro for  3 courses is misleading as everything is added on and ends up costing nearer to 45 euro   I was so disappointed to find that I had been overcharged by 46 euro  It took at least 3 phone calls and a week before the money was refunded 
R0187,Regretably wont be returning to a very special hotel as the restaurant experience was inadequate 
R0187,Overall very disappointing  Food poor quality for a 5 star hotel restaurant  Service inconsistent and slow  No management supervison as such basic concepts as quality of food and service should not be an issue in such a 5 star hotel establishment  
R0187,Overall we enjoyed our visit   We had a booking for 1pm  While we understand that this place s first sitting is at 1pm when we arrived at 12 50pm  we were told that we could not sit at our table until 1pm and were asked to go to the bar or find seating elsewhere in the foyer until 1pm  Given that it is the Christmas season  the hotel was very busy and it was impossible to find a seat  In addition one of our party has cancer and found it difficult to stand for even this short period of time  As this was a celebration post cancer treatment  it was extremely disappointing and did colour our experience  It should be possible to sit at your Table in this place from 12 45pm and it should not prove inconvenient for staff 
R0187,"Quality all around as expected   
Excellent service"
R0187,We asked the waiter about the other seating as to if we could move in there  we only saw a few people in there  He came back to say it was fully booked out and you have to pre book those seating areas  Where in earth do you find that out inless you have been before Only got 2 scallops with a dot of sause for �14   main of fish was overcooked and when i told the waiter nothing was done about it and our bill was wrong  really dissapointing so we never bothered with dessert   
R0187,Really Disappointing  When we first arrived we walked though a really romantic quiet with dim lighting where we instantly though this was gorgeous  where we sat was in the back with all the noisy guests It had these horrid spots that beemed down on you 
R0187,Really enjoyed our lunch  the service was excellent 
R0187,Sad experience  We were celebrating my 70th birthday last Friday  We requested a special table for the ocassion  When we arrived  we had been assigned another table and we had to wait 10min for the one we wanted  The service was terrible  we had to serve ourselves  the bread  and  butter  as well as the wine  They made us wait a lot for the main course and paid very little attention to our table as there was a big party next to us  Positive: the food was ok 
R0187,Sad experience   the food was terrible
R0187,Sangria sucked  bruscetta was dank  pizza 5/10  lasagna 6/10 
R0187,"Service wasnt great unfortunately  Waiter wasnt familiar with the menu and joked �youd know I only work here one day a week�   Drinks order was forgotten about then blamed on a busy bar when we reminded him    
Water wasnt topped up regularly   
The restaurant has huge potential but was let down by the staff "
R0187,Simply delicious  food was perfectly mouth watering x impeccable service throughout 
R0187,Slightly disappointing  Was hoping on a tuesday evening to have a table for two in main part of restaurant where there was a bit of a buzz but we were placed near the oyster bar that had no atmosphere whatsoever  The air was really chilly due to the air conditioning so I would suggest that if you feel the cold you should something warm to wear  Food was fine 
R0187,Staff were lovely  very helpful  Excellent wine recommendations  The surfn turf is amazing  Highly recommended 
R0187,Staff were pleasant and very accommodating
R0187,Superb dinner  excellent service  Made this a memorable evening for my wifes birthday 
R0187,Superb food and service
R0187,Superb meal in great surroundings  Conor the tall waiter was very good
R0187,Superb Sunday lunch  Really enjoyed   look forward to an early return   outstanding  Thanks to the team there 
R0187,Table was in alcove away from the restaurant no atmosphere whatsoever could been at Home underneath the stairs   was very disappointed 
R0187,Tasting menu with generously sized glasses of matching wines was a real treat 
R0187,The ambiance is fun and cute  but the food is mediocre to downright terrible  �The only good thing was the garlic cheese bread and  according to my pescatarian daughter  the Halloumi Burger  �My husband had a burger which he thought was meh  and I had the chicken enchilada which was horrible  � Another reviewer said the Nachos were great so we got them  thumbs down  �Oh  and it was super slow  took forever to get the food  �It gets two stars because the location is good and decor is entertaining 
R0187,"The food and service in the restaurant was very good  However the bar service outside was very poor with bar staff ""couldnt care less attitude about serving you "
R0187,The food and service were both great  We had a lovely evening  The table dh�te menu is good value
R0187,The food was excellent and the service perfect   Always a treat 
R0187,"The food was great and the service was perfect  We enjoyed ourselves 
I would definitely recommend "
R0187,The food was really good would go back with friends for sure 
R0187,The food was very good  However  the server was incredibly rude  This was my second time going to this restaurant  and I unfortunately had the same poor service  The rest of the staff were very friendly as was management  The ambience was fine except the fire alarm went off twice during the dinner 
R0187,The lunch was beautiful and great value for money  Definitely coming back soon 
R0187,The only good thing about my last visit here was the waiter Simon  shortie  who kept a cool head and positive attitude dealing with about 30 people on our table  Well done 
R0187,The only thing that saved the day qas the delicious chocolate brownie which i am a huge fan ok
R0187,The restaurant  is what it is 5 star we thouroughly enjoyed our meal couldnt fault anything
R0187,The restaurant is what it is 5 star we thouroughly enjoyed our meal couldnt fault anything
R0187,The room was dark due to the blinds being drawn due to the outside scaffolding   despite the outer part being empty   When asked about why my sister whose birthday it was  had not eaten her chicken we said it was bland  on a bed of peas     When we came to pay we were given free coffee  From a five star hotel I would have expected not to have to pay for such substandard food   Very poor response 
R0187,"The security guy made us wait in the hall while somebody went to check if we genuinely had a reservation  At least I think thats what was happening but I cant be sure as nobody bothered to explain 
The person checking our reservation didnt return 
We were told our table would be ready shortly after arrival but had to wait for longer than 30 minutes 
We were promised a free drink to make up for the delay but no free drink arrived 
The food was great 
Overall  very disappointing "
R0187,The service was excellent however menu selection was very disappointing  The food was bland and not up to five star standard  We were pleased with the restaurant layout and ambience however it was very cold which added to our disappointment and discomfort 
R0187,"The service was poor  
The food was at best passable  But certainly did not represent value for money "
R0187,We were given one menu on arrival  When our waiter brought our wine he asked to take our food order  I pointed out that we only had one menu  He returned with a second  Then did not reappear for about fifteen minutes  
R0187,The service was second to none  and the food was delicious  Cant wait to come back 
R0187,The service was very good  but the food was disappointing  We had the chateaubriant  and the meat was tough 
R0187,The steak with a fondue side was laughable  it was again a steak on a bed of over fried flavourless potatoes with a thimble full of cold cheese sauce  Again no side offered  despite it being written on menu  Dry and tasteless 
R0187,The welcome was great when we arrived and from that I thought it was going to be a fine dining experience but to be honest it wasnt  The food came out quickly  which was great but it was the wrong food  3 different people looking after one table is always going to lead to a mix up 
R0187,Maybe my expectations were just a bit high but I was a little disappointed  It didnt ruin our night by any means but just a slight let down 
R0187,This is a fantastic place to eat   would highly recommend A+++
R0187,This is an amazing menu  Really nice food with a spin  Highly recommend this restaurant  Its also great value  Try it for yourself 
R0187,This place was ok but could have been a lot better  The fish and chips was ok but lacked seasoning and the peas were terrible  The goat chew salad came with a very small amount of goat cheese  Overall we were very disappointed 
R0187,"This restaurant was recommended to us by a local  so we really expected better when we stopped there for lunch  

My husband really liked his soup  but that was the best part of our 2 meals  The small side of Cole slaw that came with his soup was basically large pieces of cabbage without much taste  

I had the lasagna and I really didnt care for it  Even if it did not taste like the lasagna that I was used to  it would have been okay if I had liked it  I did like the bread that was served with it  We asked the server for water twice and never got it  I had ordered tea  which we also had to ask for again after our meal was served "
R0187,"This was a let down  not because of the quality of the food  but because the this place  is held in such high regard  and  I was hoping to treat my GF to an experience akin to the one I had a few weeks prior 

Let me say what was good:  the starter was gorgeous  Salmon ; the wine very good  Cab Sav  Chilean  2011   and the dessert  Creme Brulee   and  coffee very nice  

However  the main course  and  service left much to be desired  We both had Steak for our mains  a E5 00 surcharge   not a problem   presuming it to be a strong standard given the Chefs reputation; we told the server ""medium rare""  but received medium to well done  Not one server approached us to ask was everything okay during the meal  and no one asked how our meal was until we paid "
R0187,This was a real experience  The French chef is creating miracles for a very affordable price  Highly recommended 
R0187,Too quality food and perfect for special pre theater meal
R0187,Truly an ell extraordinary experience in a legendary  hotel   3 course for 34 Euro  is second to none value
R0187,Twice visited  twice impressed  Great customer service for a start  Got the 3 course deal  think it was 3 course for 19 99  with garlic bread  calzone and brownie/fudge cake to top it off  Will definitely return for my pizza fix  Great thin pizza and calzones on offer 
R0187,Ughhhh     stay away from this one  For me  after a night out on town  grabbing a greasy burger before bedtime is a ritual  It can sometimes be the highlight of the evening  if the food is good and the night was crap  And as I go out way to often for my own health or wallet  I like to mix up the joints a bit 
R0187,Unfortunately on the day I was there Young school children were allowed run around the restaurant  There was no attempt by staff to stop them 
R0187,Uninspiring mediocre food in an environment that could be anywhere
R0187,unreal every time i come to his restaurant it just gets better great choice menu changes often and the specials are very tought out just great
R0187,Very annoyed that the set  lunch menu price was inflated to Euro 50 for two courses just because its Christmas week  over 100 percent increase  a complete rip off  Ill be taking my business elsewhere in future 
R0187,"Very disappointed had visited here previously and found it excellent 

Our main was not up the standard of previous meals "
R0187,Very enjoyable dining experience  excellent food and service 
R0187,Very enjoyable experience from start to finish  Food exceeded my expectations 
R0187,Very enjoyable experience  Food and service excellent  I will be back 
R0187,Very enjoyable food excellent although childrens menu quite expensive 
R0187,Very nice meal here; interesting menu  great open kitchen  friendly staff  craft beer on tap  funky interior  Whats not to like  Nothing 
R0187,"Was not very impressed   Some Staff were not very attentive and I felt I was bothering them   For example upon arrival when I hesitantly Approach a member of staff  to inform her that we had a reservation I recieved a frosty reception and I felt that I was an inconvenience to her It was a very special occasion  and our first time at the this place  
We wont be hurrying back 
"
R0187,we a wonderful evening great service  food and ambience were excellent 
R0187,"We booked dinner prior to going to the Gaiety for a 7 30 show  but unfortunately for us dinner in this place was not suitable   The service was very slow and despite informing the waiter that we wanted to eat dinner and  leave at 7pm  it still made no difference   We had to leave without finishing our desert and without coffee   We were so disappointed as we were in the bar from 4pm and had we known the service was so slow  we would have eaten bar food 

"
R0187,Overall very disappointing  bad value and no atmosphere  I would avoid in future 
R0187,"We booked for 4 for a special Christmas meal the Friday before Christmas   The maitred insisted the booking was for 5 even though we had an email for the booking  We were put into a booth away from the main restaurant with no other diners around us  The main restaurant wasnt full  The food was very average for the price and the ribeye steaks were stringy and undercooked   There were no serving spoons with the veg  at  Euro 5 per portion extra  
There were mince pies with the tea and these were clearly out of a box and not even heated 
We complained to a waitress and she never came back to us  We complained again and a manager came over and offered us a drink each  All was charged on the bill 
Avoid at any cost"
R0187,We booked this place as part of a package including room and breakfast as a treat for our wedding anniversary Sadly it was not much of a treat We decided to have an aperitif at the table My husbands sherry arrived promptly but my glass of champagne arrived 20 minutes later long after the arrival of the starter and the bottle of wine ordered with dinner Such a shame as I had ordered an especially nice champagne Starters were good however mains halibut for me  salmon for him   were totally overcooked and had to be sent back We were offered replacements but declined in favour of two cheese plates  which came with small glasses of port The cheese was so cold it was impossible to detect any flavour and the selection was poor Disappointed 
R0187,Disappointed Food  service ambienec everything was a total letdown
R0187,we cruise a lot our experience could be compared to the service we receive on the ship
R0187,We enjoyed a lovely Sunday lunch and the service was excellent 
R0187,We enjoyed our meal and the staff were very nice but unfortunately my father got violently ill 20 minutes after eating the oysters   So the experience was cut short  Our waiter was not particularly interested when we told him what had happened and reported that no other diners had experienced this and so it wasnt a concern for them  I understand that eating raw shellfish can be a game of roulette however once someone has had an extreme reaction I would have thought a more concerned response would have been forthcoming  The floor manager was more understanding and as a courtesy didnt charge us for my fathers meal  which to be honest seemed the least they could do 
R0187,We enjoyed the pre theatre menu immensely   The hotel is a treat to step into  the ambience is so private  the food was excellent and the service was as well  Highly recommend  
R0187,We found our experience at this place a little disappointing  I think in this day and age  vegetarians really shouldnt have to ask for a separate menu  I am not quite sure who we are offending by having our non meat choice presented on a communal menu  Having said that the choice on the special vegetarian menu was fairly limited and I opted for a roasted artichoke risotto with parmesan  I did not eat this dish as it was overpowered completely by parmesan overload  It is extremely short sighted of chefs to presume all vegetarians love cheesey things  The maitred did remove my meal from the menu which was a plus but they did not offer us bread when we sat down and the side dish arrived half way through our mains  Disappointing 
R0187,we go here on an annual basis to celebrate Christmas and especially for Christmas lunch menu which includes turkey and ham  to our disappointment we were told there is no turkey and ham after sitting down for 20 minutes which perhaps would have been a good idea to let us know before we sat down as this is the only reason why we had booked   I was also looking forward to warm crispy bread which wasnt the case  the service was shocking and took 2 5 hours to complete our two course lunch  the waitress took 35 minutes just to get our drinks and this was before even taking our food order  when we had finished our dessert when the coffee then came out by this stage we just left it behind 
R0187,We had a beautiful meal lovely table  tablecloths   cloth napkins varied menu professional friendly service great value lunch menu would definitely recommend to my friends
R0187,We had a lovely evening and would highly recommend it 
R0187,We had a lovely evening   The ambiance was excellent and the staff professional and friendly   We had the taster menu with the wines and the food was delicious   Highly recommended 
R0187,We had a lovely meal to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary  The service was great too 
R0187,We had a really lovely  relaxed lunch  Nobody rushed us and we thoroughly enjoyed a leisurely lunch
R0187,We had a very poor experience paying far too much for very average food  We had 3 beers  18   3 glasses of wine  21   a bottle of wine  30   2 starters  24   4 mains  100  and 2 coffees  7    The figures in brackets are what one would expect to pay in most high class Dublin restaurants  making a total bill of  Euro 200 00   We were charged  Euro 277 00  before tip  or 40 percent above our reasonable expectations for food that was very unremarkable   We had two portions of halibut both of which were tiny and dried out from being held under/in heat post cooking   The greatest insult is that in Ireland we had to pay for a portion of very poor mashed POTATO 
R0187,overall a mediocre experience This place needs experienced wait staff
R0187,We had a wonderful birthday lunch for my mother  Everything was just perfect  as always 
R0187,We had lunch on Sunday 2nd of August and had three courses  I expected to pay  Euro 25 95 each  which we did  but there was an additional Extra Course charge of  Euro 5 00 each  We didnt have tea or coffee and the water we got  only one glass  was tap water  We had two glases of house wine which was charged and there was a one small dish of veg we we didnt ask for 
R0187,We had such an amazing meal and the staff were so friendly helpful and knowledgeable  5 star 
R0187,We had the chateaubriand and it was outstanding   Great from start to finish 
R0187,We opted for the pre theatre/ early bird menu  The restaurant is lovely  the seating  lighting and background music are all in theme with the ambience  The waiter was excellent  friendly and informative  The food gorgeous  served in a timely fashion at a perfect temperature  For us this was excellent early evening venue and we would strongly recommend it 
R0187, For us this was not an excellent early evening venue and we would strongly not recommend it 
R0187,We pre ordered beef wellington for a birthday celebration  one with a mushroom allergy confirmed in email and over the phone  The first with no mushroom came out slightly over cooked and plated up with cep puree which mean one guest couldnt eat  Other had raw pastry  Starters were lacklustre and with a disappointing main course led to an unhappy birthday girl who was looking forward to coming to her favourite place for a treat  
R0187,Not great first impressions for the rest of the party who all work in the hotel industry  Everyone felt the service was appalling
R0187,We visited here on sat18 Feb  My daughters future in laws had come from London to meet with us before the wedding what a dreadful experience  Our table was booked for 1 30pm and at 2 50 our mains still had not arrived  We were given a sorbet  to cleanse our palate when in actual fact 3 out of 7 at the table hadnt eaten anything by that time We had a tour booked for 3  30 so we ended up bolting down our food and running out of the this place   Also 1 of the ladies requested a starter for mains at a mains sizing That didnt happen  either  so how did the this place  make up for this  They offered us a sorbet and 1 free dessert  But the moment was passed 
R0187,I was so disappointed  with the service and how they  fell short in rectifying the situation  I will not be returning any time soon and certainly would not recommend here if its an important occasion  
R0187,We were disappointed by our visit to this place   The food was not what we were expecting  I ordered the melon and parma ham salad   and got no ham  Nobody came near our table during that course so I didnt get a chance to point it out  When I did  the waiter was appologic but we heard no more about it  The Maitre D had taken our order  My friends goats cheese salad had no cheese   except in the sauce  The tuna was miniscule  The main courses were better but the Mushroom pie was hughly disappointing   basically slided mushrooms in puff pastry there was no sauce  I can see now how they can price their early birds so cheaply compared to the standard menu   but its not worth it 
R0187,We were disappointed with our meal 
R0187,We were disappointed with our meal  the people sitting next to us ordered the same main course and they were given ours   well done steak  we therefore had a long wait for ours but when it came it was the other tables steak   medium rare  We had to give these back and wait further  we had finished our wine at this stage while still waiting  we were asked if we would like more wine which was at our expense  We had young children with us as we were celebrating a birthday  they were finished their meal while we were still waiting for our main courses  My daughter asked if she could have some strawberries with chocolate as a special dessert  I was told they couldnt serve chocolate sauce so I suggested some chocolate on the side  What arrived was a very industrial looking bowl of plain chopped strawberries  All in all  not the experience I expected 
R0187,We were staying at the hotel and they put us in the back room with no windows  no view of the kitchen just ugly cartoons on the wall  ignore the photos there are only a few gold booths and you are not getting them   They first seated us at the entrance to the room were the staff would enter and I asked to be moved and they put us in the corner  There was poor light in the room and we could barely see the menus   I made the reservation a month ahead of time and was staying at the hotel and was dressed up and that was what we got  The staff was also very rude and acted like we didnt belong there  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone and for that price you could go around the block and have a better experience 
R0187,"We were very disappointed this time and I dont think I will return on a Sunday  Our table location was too near the harpist and this made conversation difficult  Because of this we asked if we could have dessert and coffee in the fron lounge area  The man who appeared to be the manager of this place told us it wasnt possible because tables had been reserved for afternoon tea  He said he would check again for us but he never returned   just ignored us          

When we went to the front area  none of the tables has been occupied  You seem to provide no where for customers to relax after a meal 

As I say very very disappointing"
R0187,Wish I had one good thing to report   Service was dreadful   Food was subpar    Euro 275 for 4 people   Will cross this off my list and not return 
R0187,without a starter course we had to wait43minutes for our main course  practically no green vegetables and extremely small size plaice with one person meal
R0187,Overpriced and unfriendly staff  The interior is good though  Bad food and limited menu
R0187,without any warning and against what is on their website  we were given a festive menu for lunch on Friday which is double the normal price   We were not given any other options   Service was only ok  cold in parts and had a hard sell on sides and desserts whenever declined   Left waiting for 40 minutes for our 2nd bottle of wine once ordered   Drinks afterwards were very expensive and served wring   a double gin given at first in error but still charged for it  and all drinks served in the wrong glasses   brandy and Tanqueray all served in regular high ball glasses   This has been an old favourite for years but this was over priced  opportunistic with bad service   Will not be returning 
R0187,Wonderful night food was amazing service was excellent staff very friendly
R0187,"Best Pad Thai ever  
Another star for the friendly service"
R0188,An amazing meal and friendly staff
R0188,Excellent food and service  Will definitely return 
R0188,First class food and service   more that happy to come again and recommend to friends 
R0188,Good fast food burgers  Would highly recommend the cashel burger and the chubby chips  Staff is really fast and nice 
R0188,Great food  fantastic service  Came here on a whim  but Ill definitely be planning a return trip 
R0188,"Had a fantastic business lunch there  Chowder is amazing 
Will come back for sure "
R0188,"Honestly the guiness stew is just wow  Very tasty  We also had carrot soup which was also beautiful  
Atmosphere was also good "
R0188,Lovely venue   Great food  staff and atmosphere 
R0188,Lovely vibe  great service  amazing prawn tostado and calamari starters  excellent shepherds pie and seafood linguini   
R0188,"Nice and cosy restaurant  Staff were brilliant and the food was great  We sat at a quite area of the restaurant  
Will definitely go back "
R0188,Really nice setting  Hidden from the main area of Dublin but well worth the walk too  Great food and great service
R0188,Tasty food and appetizer  comfortable room  friendly staff
R0188,Thank you for making my daughters birthday dinner special  the staff was AMAZING 
R0188,This place is consistently good  Great food  wine  atmosphere  service and value 
R0188,Very friendly staff  Made feel very welcome  Food was very nice with great recommendations coming from waiter  Wine was lovely 
R0188,Very good restaurant   we look forward to going back soon 
R0188,"We had a nice meal  The waitress was very pleasant  There was a home cooked taste of the food  The sea trout with peas was very tasty  
Will go back again "
R0188,Wonderful food and service in a lovely  comfortable setting  Wine and beer both very nice  with a taste of two wines offered to make selection easy  Daily special fish was cooked beautifully and very tasty  Fish and chips hit the spot  We highly recommend and look forward to returning 
R0189,I had a terrible experience here last week  Please if you are booking PLEASE make sure to tell them that you want Teppanyaki specifically  otherwise they will place you in a very empty basement dining room where you will be served mediocre food and hear all of the fun happening upstairs that you THOUGHT you would be enjoying but only get the pleasure of listening to  I used to be a loyal fan for all of my business dinners but after a terribly embarrassing business dinner flop due to the circumstances above I will not be back 
R0189,We booked For Christmas dinner  We regularly received the confirmation  During  Christmas I called The restaurant just to announce my arrival but they refused my booking  I definitely suggest not to choose This restaurant 
R0190,Best burger Ive had in a very long time  The kids loved the steak off the kids menu 
R0190,Excellent local restaurant  well worth a visit 
R0190,Excellent restaurant  Food  service  style  are q real treat  I simply love it 
R0190,Fantastic food with great service  will definitely return 
R0190,Food is always excellent   Lovely staff and great atmosphere  Ive never had a less than great night here 
R0190,"Food menu has changed No plain mash for people who cant eat onions  Sweet corn soup that you could eat with a fork and wasnt a nice taste not much taught put into that 
Steak that the chef couldnt cook to the right request   and the side pepper sauce that needed pepper added to it from the table shaker to make it taste like pepper sauce 
The price was astronomical for food that would be better served in Eddie rockets 
I would not come back here again and certainly wouldnt recommend it to anyone  I know"
R0190,Food was extremely overpriced but I could get over that if it was nice  The pork fillet was tough and just came with mash and a rhubarb sauce   scandoulas at 25 euro  Nachos were poor as were the chicken wings and the rhubarb crumble was like something a child would make   The waiting staff are very friendly and attentive but it is not a restaurant I would ever go back to  
R0190,Found the staff very friendly and polite  service was excellent  and great value there chicken wings were to die for would highly recommend  
R0190,Friendly crew with a good assortment of wine and a few beers and cocktails  Not a deep wine menu but enough to keep any wine enthusiast happy 
R0190,Gorgeous little restaurant  Perfect for pretheatre dinner  They have a really interesting menu  and  the food is gorgeous  We will definitely return 
R0190,"Great food and friendly staff 
Would definitely return "
R0190,Great lunch  my Dubliner burger was fantastic as were the skinny fries  My wife loved her beet and portabella burger  Good service as well 
R0190,Great pizza for a decent cost  Fast service and kind staff  Good decoration and atmosphere 
R0190,had a fantastic night out  the food and service was very good  will definitely go back soon with family and friends
R0190,I bought a gift voucher for a table for 4 = and in was a big birthday for my brothers in laws  They say they had a terrible meal   had to send back dishes   and found the service indifferent even rude  I was horrified given it was a 120 gift to try and celebrate after a lot of illnesses  I had been recommended the restaurant and had earlier bought a gift voucher for 60 for my brother and his wife and they had had an early bird and had not reported a negative experience    but Im so upset that this group had such a bad experience and poor and in their view indifferent food and service 
R0190,I could  not recommend the place enough   Great food  lovely staff and super atmosphere 
R0190,I have been to this restaurant many times as i live locally and it is always first class  I have brought many friends to the restaurant over the years 
R0190,I ordered 10oz rump steak  chips and onion rings   We didnt order starters and so we were told wed have to wait 20 minutes for main course  Thats ok as good food is worth waiting for   The food was nice except for the small bowl of skinny chips and gravy that was like water   I shouldnt have had to ask for a proper portion in such an establishment  Euro 26   As I left still hungry  I wont be going back again 
R0190,I was expecting more    the place in nice and cosy but the food was basic  nothing outstanding  yet quiet pricey for what it was  Staff was nice and helpful  but the menu is limited and nothing I saw justifies the pricey food
R0190,Ill start with the positives  Bellini  Albari�o  Tomato Salad  Striploin  Coffee  and  Sticky toffee pudding all good  We werent told what was NOT available until wed ordered it which was a little annoying  My starter of �hand dived Irish scallops with black pudding  and  rhubarb was very underwhelming   not least because I got just ONE tiny scallop with 2 slices of black pudding  This is  Euro 12  Complained  and  was quickly brought a 2nd tiny scallop  Husband had Cornflake Chicken  aside from the novelty of coloured cauliflower  he felt it it was an average weekday dinner  My main was Striploin  very tasty  and  tender  Veg was sitting in a pool of water which wasnt pleasant  chips were ok  Unfortunately I poured my pepper sauce before tasting it  and  it was so salty it was inedible  Had to complain again  and  was offered an alternative which was fine once Id scraped what I could off the meat  Staff offered our coffees  and  dessert  we only wanted 1 to share  on the house  which I appreciated  But this was an anniversary dinner  and  a very rare opportunity to get out so I was very disappointed 
R0190,Lovely atmosphere  Very relaxed and with great food  Will be back
R0190,Lovely breakfast here the other day  The coffee was great and the food was good  Lovely staff   great ambiance 
R0190,Lovely evening  Great food  Super staff 
R0190,Lovely food  great staff  highly recommended  Very fresh ingredients 
R0190,Lovely place with very nice food  and great service 
R0190,Lower than average and overpriced food
R0190,Nice staff very attentive  Food sounded better than it was  Great to have s place in Glasnevin
R0190,Not relaxing Queue was out the door which added to the cramped feeling
R0190,"Overpriced for a local restaurant   Glass of wine at  Euro 7 50 is ridiculous   This is my third visit and nothing  has changed for the better  Overcooked  salmon with bones  slow service  no bread offered  
Full house so some people  are happy bit not  us "
R0190,Presentation of my waffles was pretty bad  Hard to believe they let it out of the kitchen  No style or finesse to it  Just a load of bacon dumped on top   for  Euro 14 I expect more 
R0190,Really overpriced bad food  Got the roast beef  terrible flavour with watery gravy and 3 black potatoes for 19 euro 
R0190,Relaxed environment with attentive service and delicious food 
R0190,Second visit here great value early bird menu gorgeous fresh food very friendly staff
R0190,The food was amazing  delicious and magical  Only magic could result in a soft egg inside crispy light tempura batter  Go to this restaurant if you want to be wowed 
R0190,The food was great but service was very poor  The waitress was not friendly or helpful at all  Ok  we were there just once  holidays  but still  And then she just charged us 12 5 percent service    didnt make a fuss about it but I surtainly had no good feeling afterwards 
R0190,"The seafood chowder was very thick and tasted very much like a tin of Campbells condensed soup which was very off putting and meant it didnt taste fresh  Im not sure whether it was thickened with too much cornflour but it was not very nice  There were lots of big pieces of big fish but this was the only redeeming feature Im afraid 
My husband had the eggs florentine and the bread on which the poached eggs were placed were wet  It seemed like the eggs were transferred straight onto the dish without being drained on paper first  It meant the whole dish  including the salad and bacon was water logged which was really unpleasant "
R0190,Theyre cash only  Super annoying  There are loads of better options in the area  so I wont be back 
R0190,"Very bad  When we got sold in a deal lunch for 2 people for 27euros at the end called 27 80  In addition meat it seemed gum 
The employees are friendly  but sympathy is not all  Now found an ad on Facebook that we were sold after costs 25 euros 
There are other Brazilian restaurants in the city much better 
I do not advise anyone  even "
R0190,Very nice meal in the here  well worth a visit 
R0190,Very welcoming lovely personal service and great food  We ordered from the specials  choice was good only negative we felt the portions were small 
R0190, Save your money and go elsewhere 
R0190,Well trained staff  Delicious food
R0190,"Went here just before Christmas with my family  For start we got the vegetable and meat sharing plates  They were nice and between 4 of us there was plenty for all of us to try everything  For main course I got the spinach and potato calzone with pesto and caramelised onion  The portion sizes was huge  
I really enjoyed the starter  all the meats were really flavourful  The calzone was ok  I felt like there was a lot of cheese and not a lot of the other ingredients  Overall I had a nice dinner  the staff were really friendly and the atmosphere was good "
R0190,Worst Chinese ive ever had  busy night but id still expect much better  They gave me the wrong snack box and everything in it was either undercooked or overcooked  Also i got to see them cook in front of me as i waited and hygiene standards were awful chap that later plated by meal handling raw spare ribs in front of me and never washed his hands after before putting together my cooked snack box 
R0190,Wouldnt go back anytime soon  Food was very average and expected more from this restaurant  Was disappointed leaving and to make it worse had to pay 22 Euro  in tax as the table was for 5 people which you have to pay 12 5 percent tax  I would not have left this in tips with the quality of food for the price paid  Beer range not great either 
R0190,"You have completely ruined my partners 50th Birthday meal this evening   

Having spent weeks selecting my choices for the weekend I mistakenly chose your restaurant as a premium dining experience

R0191, Hands down the best steak to value ratio Ive come across in Dublin  Absolutely fabulous piece of meat  perfectly cooked  with no surcharge on a  Euro 25/2 course early bird   The staff were brilliant  even though we sorely tested them in being a very large and very very noisy group  Youre all great  and we are sorry  Ill be back  if you let me 
R0191,Amazing food and atmosphere  Definitely worth a visit  probably one of the best restaurants in Dublin
R0191,Excellent food and service  Nice clean restaurant with good value for money  Waitress was polite and offered us 20 percent off our meal as we were on the way to 3Arena 
R0191,Fab food  friendly staff  great atmosphere  will defo be back
R0191,Fabulous meal  great floor staff and great location to the pub next door  Its also a bring your own wine with no corkage 
R0191,Fantastic meal  great staff and amazing value for money  Ideal for pre/post theatre food and drinks with the Abbey Theatre only a 2 minute walk away 
R0191,Great food  staff very pleasant and friendly would recommend this place
R0191,Great food  cooked right in front of you  Would definitely recommend the combination grill  They even song for us after our meal 
R0191,had a fabulous evening  brilliant food  great drinks  would definitely recommend  one of the most fun dining experiences i have had in a long time 
R0191,I come here usualy just to grab a beer outside  Nice and quiet spot with a wonderful view  Never very packed  regular prices and a beatiful view 
R0191,The Famous Wicklow Lamb Shank is absolutely amazing  Friendly staff  very nice location 
R0191,Worth a visit  
R0192," As a major yogism fan  perhaps I am bias  The yogurt is nice in Mooch I just dont like the way you cant do the toppings yourself  I always end up with no toppings and too much yogurt left over 
Ive gotten the pancakes twice  The first time they were nice  little dry  but I wasnt complaining too much  I got them again on Saturday and they tasted like eggs  Really werent great  
The staff are nice and it is a really nice vibe so I was sorry about the experience "
R0192," Euro 3 50 for a small coffee   Euro 3 50 for toast  butter and jam     Euro 10 for pancakes       What a ludicrous rip off  What is worse is that when I gave this place a try at 4pm on a wet Tuesday afternoon  previously unaware of their pricing policy  it was heaving with customers  This is a microcosm of how we as a nation lose the run of ourselves economically   ""I have the money  I dont care what it actually should cost "" Sure  the coffee was tasty but can you really not dish out more than 200 millilitres of it at a time   large coffees are not available �

It works out at  Euro 10 per pint  and coffee doesnt have the massive excise duty that beer has  Dont feed the greed  people "
R0192,2 5 stars   Coffee is decent  But speed and efficiency greatly suffer  I came here a few mornings in a row and without fail  a queue of customers  one person making coffee and 2 or 3 staff keeping that person company  Stopped going and went back this morning as it was a lot earlier than my usual time thinking it would be better  Nope  One staff member took 10 minutes to package scones  Seriously  When that customer wasnt even ordering coffee  couldnt one of the two idle workers look at the line and take the next coffee order  Considering its been a year and the same complaint is being made  I doubt the management cares to change 
R0192,Absolutely the best Dinning experience weve had in Ireland  The food was amazing as well as the service  If you want a first class meal its must do while in Dublin 
R0192,Awful service very rude  food was shocking we were told that the eggs Benedict was finished and we questioned why when it was still before 4pm  They suddenly came back and it wasnt an issue  Then the food was not good  We will not be going again 
R0192,"Been There a Few times 
Food was Great 
Disappointed this Time 
Steak Was Disgusting had to Send back bought It 
Back Not any better 
wont be back sorry"
R0192,Disappointing experience  Average food  Bland soup  Very expensive  Ordered dessert and was told they actually needed the table back so there was no time   Not impressed with that  They should let customers know time constraints when booking 
R0192,Everything great but the food  which was indifferent and expensive  Atmosphere and service were great 
R0192,Excellent food  and great service  Beautiful dining room upstairs on the river filled with books 
R0192,Excellent food  professional and attentive yet unobtrusive service in a charming and uplifting environment 
R0192,The deserts were very poor quality   the area in which you get your food very tiny  like standing in prison line at meal times  the drinks were a rip off price wise  i had this before it closed  it seems they learned nothing  as this even worse 
R0192,Food was tasteless but the staff were very pleasant 
R0192,Food was tasteless  Really poor quality salmon  If you got that quality for pub grub youd be raging  Service was excellent and they did take things off the bill   but really disappointed  Was there 2 years ago and was amazing  Hope it was just a bad night for chef 
R0192,"For lunchtime restaurant quite quiet   Therefore lacked atmosphere 
Food fairly basic   We ordered from the lunch menu and had starter and 
mains only   Disappointed overall "
R0192,Friendly service and nice atmosphere but our steaks were tough and tasteless  Not good value food for the price paid 
R0192,The food was 20 euro a plate and was not spicy at all  �Overpriced and over poor service  �Photo of our view for dinner 
R0192,Great food and service   unfortunately to warm and loud 
R0192,Great menus  great dinner  entire families favorite meal on 10 day trip to Ireland 
R0192,I am not sure why the place is even in top 100  Food was not even average   it was poor  Extremely over priced for an extremely sub standard food  I dont mind paying for a small portion of food if it was quality  but honestly  the food was shockingly bad  Wouldnt recommend 
R0192,I couldnt tolerate the chill and the loud music bursting from the speakers  we left and decided to pay by card  Paying by card didnt even work as the system they had setup was suffering from network errors causing timeouts during payment process  Nothing seemed to go right and we decided we wont be back again in a hurry if at all 
R0192,The really bad thing here was the customer service   
R0192,"I had a very disappointing meal  I ordered a medium rare steak  When it arrived it had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp for a while as the butter had congealed on top  When I cut into it I could clearly see that it was overcooked   I sent it back and it was soon replaced with another steak that was also overcooked  which I again alerted my waiter about  At this point I gave up and waited for my fellow diners to finish their main courses 

When the bill arrived I was rather surprised that they were intending to charge for the inedible steak s    When I pointed this out to the waiter he had it removed from the bill  but I should never have been in the position of having to ask for this to be done 

I was disappointed because this place has one of the best locations in Dublin and I have used it many times to entertain visitors to Dublin  but the food was really disappointing and Im not sure Ill be back "
R0192,I was here for a late work lunch the week before Christmas   We all opted for the set menu   The food disappointed   The parsnip soup to start was bland   Salt  and  Pepper did not help and the soup was not finished   The goats cheese starter was OK  barely   The salad leaves were undressed and the dish lacked any flair   Mains were steak  salmon  and  turkey   The salmon was good  steak OK but turkey was terrible   The turkey was dry and overdone  Served with a dish of stuffing and roast potatoes   The cranberry sauce was the best part of the dish   Desserts were bread pudding  chocolate tart  and christmas pudding with ice cream   The christmas pudding was served cold   not good   I will not be returning   Service was also terribly slow 
R0192,I was here with my work colleague on Wednesday 27th Feb and the experience was horrible  Had to take my colleagues to another place for lunch
R0192,Its a nice place but the food was not good   4 people and nobody enjoyed the meal  The braised meat had grizzle in it and was inedible 
R0192,Main dish good  but the accompanying vegetables poor  Starters good  desserts limited 
R0192,My husband and I went here for a date night in Dublin while we were on vacation  We stumbled upon it while exploring  and we decided to eat there because it looked like it had a cute bookshop attached  which it does  but it was closed when we went there for dinner   The view of the Liffey is spectacular  the service was excellent  and the food was very good as well  I highly recommend the duck breast for a main course  They have an excellent wine selection  but Im not a wine drinker  so I didnt take  Highly recommend if youre looking for a romantic setting with great food 
R0192,Nosiy   Tables too close together   chairs uncomfortable   no tableclothes esoteric menu
R0192,Overall we were disappointed with this restaurant  I was very excited about going as I heard some good reviews about it but we left thinking we wont be going back  I requested a window seat if possible as we were celebrating a special occasion but when we walked in we were told this wasnt possible  which is fine but all of the tables are jammed in on top of each other so it was uncomfortable  We chose to go upstairs and I think the staff up there were run off their feet as only two of them and the place was filling up  We were still looking forward to the dinner  and  all I can say is that it wasnt worth the money  everything was bland  I am also 5 months pregnant  and  the options werent good for me  especially with the starters  I could hardly cut the asparagus  all for al dente but it was just too much  and the duck was only ok   I could have made better at home tbh  The chocolate pot dessert was nice though 
R0192,Sorry  food is good but having a brunch consisting of a single potato croquet can not cost you 18 euro 
R0192,"Staff very welcoming and attentive  food presented magnificently and tasty  
very busy and loud restaurant   wooden floor/chairs   no soft furnishings to dampen sound  tables set up in very close proximity to others  chairs not conducive to any form of comfort"
R0192,"Table to small for 2 
Table was not steady 
Service very quick  as if we had to hurry"
R0192,The food is rather basic  despite the fancy words on the menu card  and much too expensive for what you get  7 EUR for a standard beer  The salmon based starter  15 EUR  was a small pancake with a minimal piece of salmon on top  42 EUR for a small steak with fries seems not great value  Too many small tables are placed in a small room to maximize turnover  Cant recommend this restaurant to a friend 
R0192,The food was acceptable  but for the price point there are better options in Dublin   It would have been helpful to  before we offered an upstairs seating option  that we would share the space with a very large table of about 20 diners   Conversation was near impossible 
R0192,The overall experience was disappointing   We were initially seated on the second floor where it was extremely noisy We had decided to leave before ordering and told the waiter who was very obliging and we were moved to a table on the first floor which was much quieter  Waiter service was friendly and efficient but the food generally didnt live  up to our expectations  We had eaten here about a year ago and returned because of our good experience 
R0192,The owners of this restaurant havent even bothered to contact me to date to apologise for the way me and my family were treated when we were in this restaurant 
R0192,The worst treatment of customers I have experienced  The manager had the most appalling approach and tone with paying customers  The food was just ok so definitely not worth spending your time or money when there are many wonderful places to eat in Dublin 
R0192,This restaurant has excellent food  attentive service  and reasonable prices 
R0192,This was our third visit distinguished by extremely slow and inattentive service  The restaurant may have been short staffed that night  We waited close to 45 minutes for our food  The glasses of wine were brought straight away  leaving my white to warm unpleasantly  I love the cockles and mussels; they arrived coolish from  the kitchen  Water glasses were refilled only after we had finished eating  The odor or burning filled the room and I spied a half charred napkin at a neighboring table; the tea light candles had been placed by themselves on the tables without benefit of a glass to hold them or base on which to set them   Service on our previous visits was better 
R0192,Thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience  Food was delicious   The service was exceptional  informative friendly obliging staff  Highly recommend 
R0192,"Tonight we stayed in and used their delivery service  We ordered a vegetable burrito  beef tacos  carnitas tacos  chips and guacamole  The highlights include:

Took an hour and fifteen minutes 

Food was cold  not slightly warm  actually cold  

The burrito was really soggy  impossible to hold 

Added onions to the tacos with the order  werent in the tacos but in a tiny a plastic container with some cold  slimy onions and peppers 

The tacos  also soggy  were really bland and although one set was pork with the corn salsa and the other beef with the hottest salsa  they actually tasted identical and not exciting in any way 

They forgot to deliver the chips and guacamole  When I rang there was no apology  we were offered a refund but we preferred to get it sent out  This took another hour and fifteen minutes  I can understand it being Saturday night but when speaking to them on the phone I was given the impression that they could care less that they made an error and their food was well below an acceptable standard  

It seems like they tried to copy Chipotle and got it all totally wrong  evident by the mediocre food and incompetent staff 

I will never eat their food again "
R0192,Took a friend to show off the Dublin food scene: disappointment  Service slow  food cold and unseasoned  did not stay for dessert  Expensive for what  Would not recommend 
R0192,Unfortunately the main dishes were not good  The Dry aged Steak was either cold or chewy  The haddock was drowned in sauce  Too expensive for the value 
R0192,Very disappointing evening  Staff appeared to be under a lot of pressure  Initial table so bad I was going to leave however we were moved to a very nice table by the window  It would have helped it the heating was on though  The best thing about the starter was the soda bread  My main course   sea bass was overcooked and the plate and sauce were actually cold both the croquette and the crushed potatoes tasteless        Our server though polite appeared to have no interest in the answer to her question as to whether everything was ok  The quality of the food presented was so poor I felt that I was completely overcharged as the standard did not match the cost  Normally I would have ordered a cheese board and a glass of port but on this occasion I did not  Have we returned to the days where we are overcharged for bad quality food 
R0192,"Walked in at 5pm on a Thursday  place was dead  there were only 2 people at the bar 

We asked to sit at the bar for a quick drink and an appetizer  the hostess made us sit in the corner of the bar next to the candelabra that was burning 5 7 candles and dripping wax 

Horrible margaritas  horrible chips and dips  why put seeds in guacamole      and the worst overall experience in Ireland as a whole      avoid at all costs if your accustomed to authentic margaritas or guacamole "
R0192,We all enjoyed our two course lunch menu  and the staff were happy to accommodate our kids by adding mashed potatoes to their course  They also had good vegan options 
R0192,"We first ate here about five years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it  Not so much this time  We shared a starter of smoked fish that included an oyster p�te  smoked salmon  smoked rainbow trout and gavadlax  The latter was pretty tasteless  the smoked salmon undistinguished and the trout as dry as biltong  Caper berries  cr�me fr�iche and pickled cucumber helped fill the plate  as did the excellent dulse seaweed bread 
A main course of two  large  aged mozzarella croquettes proved beyond bland  although the accompanying girolles  corn puree and tomato chutney helped add flavour  Rare Irish beef striploin was more like medium rare and appeared to need more hanging as it was pretty tough 
The wine list is interesting  as are the prices  The restaurant was full to bursting  mostly with tourists  The many staff were both professional and pleasant  We could not help feeling that the place is living on past glories as the actual quality of the food and cooking left a lot to be desired "
R0192,We had a most enjoyable meal at this venue  we will return
R0192,"Well  reading reviews set our expectations high  but still it doesnt justify how mediocre atmosphere and food is  while they keep prices at Michelin star rated restaurants 

P S  It was sad to see that they charge 3 50 EUR for tapped water "
R0192,"With my main course 3 slices  of potatoe were served  They were of such poor quality   just awful  Would expect better especially this time of year  Meat and veg were lovely and enjoyable  Would expect each element of the dish to be really good  
Had bread and butter pudding for desert  flavor good  crust on pudding like rubber  Sauce I enjoyed immensely  My friend disappointed with amount of bones in her fillet of trout  I thought fish was deboned before serving  
I really do have an issue with the quality of potatoes served in restaurants in Dublin  We have such beautiful potatoes available in our shops I dont see why the restaurants cant provide customers with a high quality potato "
R0193," Undoubtedly the worst restaurant I have ever stepped foot inside 

My girlfriend and I had heard about this place from a friend  We were delighted to see them offer a discount on GroupOn  and  thought it would be the perfect opportunity for our first outing  We rang ahead  informing the host that we would be using a GroupOn voucher and were told that it wouldnt be a problem  Upon arrival  we presented the voucher at the desk to which the host informed us we were most welcome and proceeded to show us to our seats 

Our waiter was pleasant and took our order of 2 drinks  1 appetiser and 1 main course  Shortly after finishing our appetiser  the host approached our table with a shoulder of lamb to which neither of us had ordered  My girlfriend detests the smell of lamb so I refrain from eating it when Im in her company  What we believed to be a minor mistake escalated rapidly when the host returned to our table; this time  with a far more animated approach  He informed us  quite vocally  that unless we accepted the lamb shoulder  he would not accept the voucher  After explaining that my girlfriend doesnt in fact eat lamb  he proceeded to raise his voice and quite publicly embarrass the two of us  The tables surrounding us began to listen in and before long it had developed into a public spectacle  On numerous occasions  he suggested that ""This is not my problem  If you dont want to take it  go back to GroupOn and ask for a refund  But your voucher wont be accepted here "" 



The host left after venting his frustration and our initial waiter returned to apologise  He informed us that he must have misheard our order and that we could still order food if we chose to add an additional main course  After declining his offer  our voucher was returned to the table along with our bill for the drinks we had consumed 



As you can see from my previous reviews  I enjoy nothing more than providing positive feedback to establishments Ive eaten in and never leave a negative review unless absolutely necessary  However  this is  by far  the worst service I have ever received in any eating establishment  I suggest that the owner seriously reevaluates their staff as I for one  will never be returning and will not be recommending this restaurant to anyone "
R0193,"After a very pleasant experience before Christmas I organizes Ed a lunch here for the girls in the office  From start to finish ir was a very poor experience and took 1hr 45 minutes to have a main course and desserts  
Would not recommend"
R0193,Although the food is good  the service itself is appalling  Waiting staff lack basic training  Our main courses arrived along with our starters and we waited over half an hour after ordering desert for it to arrive  when we were told one of the options was sold out 
R0193,As members   we wanted to try out this new restaurant for our anniversary  We arrived at the time of our reservation and were immediately disappointed in the service  A family ahead of us had placed reserved a table that was not showing up in their system  There was no effort to resolve this issue quickly  nor did they move on to helping next in line even though there was a line out the door  When we were eventually seated  we asked for a different table that was farther from the several screaming children on that side of the room  We were told that every other table was reserved  though we had our own reservation   He eventually agreed to move us to another table  which was very unbalanced  After a bit a waiter came by and asked if we were ready to order dessert  We explained that we hadnt even gotten a menu to order our dinner   After receiving the menu  we had to find someone to get us cutlery  which came out very wet  and a wine list  We were eventually able to place our orders  The food that came out was good  but I would not say amazing  It seemed that there was much more effort put into the presentation  which was beautiful  While eating  the chef came out multiple times to argue with waitstaff  Once we had finished dessert  we asked a waitress for the bill  She went into the kitchen and never came back  We eventually had to go up and pay  I would return if the service improved vastly  but until then the price is not even slightly worth the experience 
R0193,Booked a table for lunch based on their own website   then upon arrival discovered it was a carvery only and that there was no table service  Food was adequate but no more  Main restaurant was closed for a private function and wait staff were constantly moving between the kitchen and that room past our table as it was the shortest route for them  Poorly trained staff  no communication skills   Will not be back 
R0193,Booked table for my sons communion meal before heading to Disney on ice on Saturday May 11th   All that said I was very disappointed with the food  It was overpriced for what it was and lacked freshness especially the side vegetables  It was late in the day and the Hotel was extremely busy with numerous events going on  not sure if this may have contributed to the quality of food 
R0193,"Choice of Starters was very bad  Desert was awful  Coffee was very strong too intense 

Nice staff very pleasant  Nice setting "
R0193,Disney on Ice was on  If you have children this was ideal 
R0193,Extremely poor service  Group of 7 people 4 were served and two more and the last one after everyoyelae was finished  The food was dry and tasteless poor service and very dirty surroundings
R0193,Food was horrible service was poor poor poor
R0193,"Food: Tasty but unbelievably spicy  I even requested that our food be made mild but unfortunately the kitchen didnt seem to take my request into consideration  As a person who is half Indian  I feel like my spice quotient is pretty high   but this was a whole other level 

Ambiance: Nice place  very busy which was a good sign 

Service: Horrendous  This restaurant is VERY understaffed and from getting drinks to place an order to getting the bill   everything was a CHALLENGE  Very frustrating 

Bottom Line: I wouldnt return to this place   too spicy and too busy  I definitely dont recommend it "
R0193,Good quality food and very hot  A little pricey though for the portion sizes     unfortunately not many gluten free options at all and after stating they cater for gluten free I was left a little disappointed  The service was very slow  then my side order arrived wrong although they changed it very quickly for me but my daughters burger was also not as we ordered as they forgot the cheese  so she didnt eat it   they offered to bring her a new one but the food took an hour to arrive the first time and by this time it was almost twenty to 9 so she was getting pretty tired and we refused another one  No refund on her main course was offered   We came here with really high expectations so even though the quality of our food was good  after taking everything into consideration we were left disappointed 
R0193,Gorgeous food great service very enjoyable would recommend
R0193,Great sushi and delicious gyoza but found the teriyaki completely overcooked and tasteless  Thoroughly disappointing
R0193,Had heard a lot of people raving about this place  so popped by on Saturday for lunch  Lovely spot with an outdoor seating area  As expected there was a short queue for a table  Found the menu limited enough   you would want to like eggs     I went for the Turkish eggs which was scrambled egg with pepper  spinach and a bit of spice  Unfortunately I found a massive hair tangled amongst it so really couldnt enjoy it  My friend got the pulled pork sandwich which was apparently really nice  Came to  Euro 29 with two juices for the two of us  Anyway probably wont be back given the hair incident   
R0193,"Had originally booked brunch for 6 people with 3 buggies for Mothers Day  A couple cancelled 1hr before the arranged time  When we got there we informed them  they replied with ""Youd want to see the amount of people we turned away today""  He gave us our seats which were in a nice location and right beside a table for maybe 8 people which was unoccupied for the duration of our visit  And heres me thinking it was mad busy and they were turning people away   

When we asked the hostess for the brunch menu  she grumpily nodded and no menus came  We asked a waitress then for the menus who could not have been more helpful  In fact  all the waiting staff were great  it was just their grumpy bosses we had an issue with  We were shocked at how rude they were  Food was great but the welcome gave us a bad taste in our mouths  

Will not be going back "
R0193,I had the crab with gem hearts for starter   It was very disappointing   2 tiny withered lettuce leaves   One was just the stump   I had steak for main   No steak knife given   It was ok   Desserts were nice but did not come as described on menu   Wouldnt recommend for a special night out   Vegetarian option was sad   One of our group had two sides because she is vegetarian 
R0193,menu selection poor for all ages
R0193,I was hoping for the Sunday roast on a board experience but got directed to the carvery  Carvery portions were a bit light for me and the group  Team werent too attentive to our additional orders and I felt the food was really for staff catering  The Nutella dessert cheesecake was very poor 
R0193,I was not expecting a carvery   Food was overpriced for small portions 
R0193,My partners main was also bland; it was meant to have chilies in it  but again it was not spicy nor hot in any way  Neither of us ate much of our main dishes 
R0193,Myself and my friends arrived for dinner on Saturday night last at 7 45 and we were left sitting there for 25 minutes before anyone arrived to take an order for food or drinks   Several items that were on the limited menu were finished even through it was only early evening   We waited another 15 minutes for the drinks to arrive from a very flustered waitress and the food  which were main courses only   did not arrive until 9 00pm  The staff appeared not to be trained at all and were under a lot of pressure   All in all it was not a pleasant experience and will not return 
R0193,"Not long open when we went and I would say the menu is already in need of a reshape  �The desert in particular was a bit of a frozen mess  

The interior looks great lots of space and clearly invested allot in the look and feel 

Service was good but not exceptional  Probably worth a return in a few months to see how things improved 

As a side not 24 hours later I suffered a bout a gastrointestinal issues which may be linked to the oyster starter or not but the timing was odd "
R0193,"Wanted to try something new  and will not be coming back to this place  �
There are better  cheaper options in this area "
R0193,Restaurant food was OK but server didnt know what the food was  they substituted without asking  and then I had to track them down to take care of the bill  Bill couldnt be split without identifying individual items
R0193,Sent back a dish twice and it was still not what I asked for  Also got �roaemary Chips on the side which didnt even have a hint of rosemary but they argued that they were yet you could see and taste they werent  
R0193,Service was awful 2staff on a busy Friday night waited over an hour for mains when they came 2 of the meals were cold we didnt send back as we didnt have time to wait longer  but Im sure with better service n not been forgotten about food would have been really enjoyable so will try  it again as  I really liked the menu and our friends eat there regularly and enjoy  
R0193,Service was very friendly and attentive  However  the food was not as expected  i had a set menu and paid the 5e supplement for a steak but this did not come with any side nor was i offered one  The pepper sauce with it was also very salty   I feel this was very poor value  My partner had a burger and this was burnt too  The dessert was lovely though 
R0193,So  so expensive for what was a very ordinary simple meal  Very limited menu  12 and a half percent service charge for 4 of us  Very disappointed  Service was fine  Certainly would not return 
R0193,The food was nice  it was carvery  I would try again but would hope the service was better 
R0193,The pizza is super greasy and fake  The prices are fair  but the quality of the pizza and staff I very low  Not the best 
R0193,"The waiter was friendly  Good service 
Bartender was Also very friendly"
R0193,There was items missing from our meal that was on the menu   2 of our party had the surf  and  turf and was extremly sick the day after   Service wasnt bad   I had the thai curry and it was tasty but missing the naan bread   once I asked for it they brought it out shortly after 
R0193,There was only a buffet available   no a la carte service   and at r servation time this was not communicated
R0193,Unfortunately the drinks had no cherry  The service was not on time or pleasant apart from the hostess  The fish was superb but the rest of the food didnt impress  lamb/risotto   The Pavlova was kind of a joke and the waiting time for serving very long 
R0193,Very disappointing as food was  cold and appeared to have been left sitting a while before service  eg  Cauliflower on halibut dish was soggy from the jus   we couldnt eat potatoes  as they were cold   waitress apologised took sides off bill  The bill still came to 82e which was ridiculously high for what we got and didnt enjoy  
R0193,Very nice restaurant wee bit dear for the food  lovely staff a apart from manager who was shouting in the dinning room at the staff about some dirty forks or something
R0193,Very poor quality of food  starters out within minutes and they were very poor  main not any better  Apple nd Berry crumble was OK 
R0193,Waitress forgot to bring bread  the fish was like rubber it would appear to be reheated in a microwave  Totally unacceptable 
R0193,We had booked for a Sunday family dinner to arrive and find a carvery lunch  The kids food was stone cold  we had to ask for hot chips for them  adults food was very poor which is a pity as we have had Sunday lunch there before and it was very good 
R0194,"2 5 stars 
I have eaten here twice now 
Restaurant is nicely decorated  and has a central location

1st visit: staff were slow in doing everything 
I ordered a bowl of fish chowder from the lunch menu  It was okay  I finished it as I was hungry and was on a short lunch break from work 

2nd visit   post renovations of getting a pizza oven and not sure what else
My colleagues and I were sat around two large tables  they had our exact numbers but placed us to close together for comfort   I spent the evening being elbowed or elbowing one of my colleagues   their was no water on the tables  we only got water after three different people asked for some  the card machine was broken so nobody could buy a drink   why do they only have one card machine     and their was a small and extremely expensive selection of drinks 
I had three course and two small glasses of red wine as part of a staff work dinner 
Wine was okay  but portion was tiny 
My mushroom soup was served without any bread or soup crackers and was burnt and way too salty   we will also not mention the fact that I had to wait with my soup in front of me for a spoon as the wait staff forgot the soup spoons  
I choose to get the sole vegetarian option on our small set menu  it was a penne arrabiata  but it was far too spicy  As in instead of a nice flavoursome dish I could not taste anything besides heat  and ended up picking out the pieces of penne pasta to eat   I love spicy food  hell I grow chilli peppers   but this was ridiculously spicy  
The dessert I choose was the strawberry cheesecake   now I come from the tradition of making cheesecake with philadelphia cheese  however I have come to expect the gelatin version when eating out   it was awful  It tasted like sugary fake strawberries  and was so bad that I did not finish it  I love cheesecake and I could not finish my dessert  that has to say a lot 
In summary  I will no longer be recommending this place for lunch after visiting   and will tell my friends not to visit as it is not worth the time or money "
R0194,30 minutes after ordering I started to wonder if our appetizers were put in the system  as I recall them coming out quickly on past visits and I began to casually look for our server to inquire  45 minutes later  our beers and water in need of refills  I desperately tried to flag down ANY server in the dining area and despite plenty of servers on the floor  nobody made eye contact with our table nor checked in with us  
R0194,Amazing soup  
R0194,"Absolutely terrible worst meal Ive had in my entire �life  sweet and sour chicken red raw and Ill be lucky if I dont wake up with 
 salmonella poisoning in the morning   people sitting beside us also giving out about the food cannot recommend enough to stay away from this place 
I would give it a 0stars if I could"
R0194,After reading all of the reviews I had high hopes for this place  I was completely disappointed  Too many issues to list  but here are a few: Service was slow and the staff largely ignored us  They also didnt know what was in the dishes  The oyster appetizer we wanted was unavailable  Half of the mussels in both of our portions were dead  unopened  and therefore inedible  The hake dish was so bony that it was also nearly impossible to eat  I would never go back 
R0194,All is good but a server was really rude when we are trying to split the bills  I love the restaurant very much that is why I have always recommended this place  but the servers attitude is really disappointing and I truly hope she would understand how it affected my night and she would reflect upon herself  Overall outstanding food and service by the other servers 
R0194,Awful food  Dont eat here  But  pints are grand and youll get a seat if your going to watch a match  But definitely dont eat there 
R0194,Been a few times and liked it but every time I go the menu gets smaller  less interesting  less of a reason to return 
R0194,Fantastic food  great location  service was wonderful  recommend 100 percent best meal we had in Dublin 
R0194,"First impressions were not good    our reservation could not be found  we were asked quite condescendingly if we had actually made a reservation   Despite arriving a few minutes late  our table was not ready and then we were seated in the worst table  close to the entrance to the dishwashing area  despite there being other empty tables available  
I ordered Steak  and  Eggs  note plural in the title and description  medium well  The steak came out closer to well done with only one egg  My husband ordred the Alabama dry rub chicken wings which were so dry as to render them almost inedible  We commented to the waiter about this and was reminded it was a dry rub  However  dry rub should not equate dry meat which was the problem  The wings  despite being served as a large portion  were tiny and obviously easily overcooked which is what happened  Our waiter did bring us some sauces to try to alleviate this and even offered to change the dish to buffalo wings  However  at this point  my husband had lost his appetite  
We had our six year old with us and was not offered a kids menu  though a later table right behind us with two kids was offered the kids menu right away   I had simply assumed there wasnt a kids menu not being offered one  
On a positive note  our waiter was good  He recommended a kids portion size for the waffles which was delicious  He was attentive and in my opinion did try to engage in service recovery   
 Euro 82 for a very disappointing meal overall   two mains  a kids dish  two non alcholic drinks  one cocktail and one beer  Service charge on a table of three  We left a 10 percent tip on top of that for the waiter in cash and we hope he got that as we appreciated his efforts  
It was meant to be a much anticipated Fathers Day brunch and the meal was a major let down overall  We will not be back "
R0194,Food was nothing spectacular for the prices  Very expensive for bland food  A few extras on the plate wouldnt have gone astray  Wont be going back and wouldnt recommend 
R0194,Found our meal very mediocre  Ordered the mussels and chips  with a bisque  The bisque was very thin and watery and the chips were so big they were not cooked through properly  Will not be returning 
R0194,Had dinner here  great staff  good vibes  nice food  and the owner/manager was so kind  I would definitely come back on a return trip
R0194,I booked the table for 18 00  and ended up there at 10 minutes early had to wait for another 30 mins  It was horrible 
R0194,"I had high hopes walking in here  having had drinks there before and admired the food from a distance  Unfortunately  from the get go the service let it down 
My chowder arrived cold  and when I asked for it to be heated  it was brought back with a visible microwave skin  My guests mussels were delicious  If not a little salty  
After our starters we waited just under 50 minutes for our main courses  which were dover sole  and  scampi  Both quick dishes to prepare  In that time the waiter constantly apologized for the delay and we finished our bottle of wine  
When our mains arrived there was more confusion over the sides which came with my sole  which was a little frustrating  Its a shame when good food is let down by poor service  It was busy and having worked in restaurants for years I know it can be tough  but this was unacceptable  

The sole was good  the caper butter was nutty and delicious and the fish itself was beautiful  The sides however  with the exception of the truffle chips  were again  disappointing  Undressed salad is a cardinal sin in my eyes 
Altogether the bill came to just short of  Euro 90 so all in all  nothing too ridiculous  I wont be rushing back any time soon though "
R0194,I have eaten here a number of times but my experience of brunch on Sunday fell way short of my previous experiences  The service was slow and our waitress was rude  The food was varied in quality  nice enough but very overpriced  The gender communal toilets are not for me and it would be nice to have an option of more privacy  This place used to be my go to place when eating out in Dublin  I will be going elsewhere next time 
R0194,I mean  the food is not too bad but it definitely should not be ranking first in Dublin  Please do not have a high expectation going there or you will be disappointed 
R0194,"I was going to say: Meh  but it wasnt as good as Meh 
The service was excellent  friendly and helpful   Location is great   But the menu sound really interesting  until you realise that anything substantial costs a bucket of money   So  not being well to do  eight of us had the sandwich type things: fish fingers  steak sandwich  brisket roll   And quite honestly  for a sandwich  it is over priced   I did have the tin of anchovies as a starter  and that was delicious  although all the kitchen staff had to do was assemble: nothing was made in the restaurant  except  perhaps  for the bread 
Oh  the bread and butter pudding is wonderful 
But the mains were just too cafe style with expensive restaurant prices   I appreciate the imagination of combinations  but not at this price 
I probably wont return again "
R0194,Ive been here lots and love it  Today not good  Burger v v dry and Mac n cheese was also v v dry  Typical Irish we didnt complain mostly because it was bank hollier sat and we wr having a lovely time and didnt want the stress and attention 
R0194,Ive been in this reastaurant over 1y ago and I remember a better value for money  I was pretty disappointed by the meal that was nothing special  The cost is a little too high  The place is really nicely decorated 
R0194,If I could give this place 0 stars I would  Our food was inedible and something exploded in my mouth  Horrible service and way too expensive  Would not recommend to my worst enemy in a million years 
R0194,"Im not quite sure what all the rave is about   a friend recommended this and said this place provided the best dessert he ever had    ever  I would beg to differ  I dont think any American would be caught dead eating The restaurant has a beautiful display of desserts  open seating  high top ceilings and two check out areas  Staff was helpful  however the manager Alex led us astray  When asking for the local favorite that was worth trying  we tried an over cooked and mediocre brownie cheesecake  

We are visiting from America and were horrifically disappointed  We will set the records straight with our friends and will never return "
R0194,It was the worst place ive been to in a long time  The fishplate was awful  salty and smoked different pieces  The angus beef was so tough that we had to send it back  the hamburger was dry and so was the homemade potatos  The ribs were to sweet and dry as well  Do not go there 
R0194,Lovely food but unfortunately there was a lot of mix ups with our orders which spoiled things a bit  Some of our group had finished their starters while two of us had been given the wrong order  and  had to wait for the new orders to come  Then there was a mix up with desserts it all seemed a bit disorganised  Definite lack of communication   I think language barrier may have been the problem
R0194,Lovely food and service as always  Accommodating to vegans Thank you
R0194,Lovely meal and staff are both friendly and informative of the menu  Go here regularly and will continue to keep going
R0194,Mediocre sandwich and soup way overpriced  too crowded  No point to this place 
R0194,"Myself and my wife had the most fantastic night here  
The food  entertainment and Gin menu    
You cant go wrong here  Fantastic evening "
R0194,Nothing special  Bland tasteless fish fingers served with a ramekin of frozen peas  Not worth the money 
R0194,Overall not so pleasant experience 
R0194,Place was recommended by our airbnb host  Food was OK  but there are other places to eat in Dublin for cheaper and better
R0194,"Really enjoyed it   Highly recommended 
And in the heart of the city "
R0194,Rude wait staff  They acted as though we were inconveniencing them when we asked for water  Tiny menu with not many options  They couldnt wait to have our table back   felt very unwelcome  Would not recommend this place
R0194,Spectacular farm to table food and generous portions
R0194,stuffed 5 of us into a table for 4 beside the door despite prebooking  smell of cooking fat from kitchen just worsened as evening went in  quite expensive in the end for mediocre evening  
R0194,Super lunch  very relaxed  Food was delicious and service was top class
R0194,"The food was good  my only real complaint is how slow the food was to come out  We waited 40 mins between our starter  and  mains  

We had wings  very tasty   Burger was great value as it was huge  soup as nice but the sandwich was way more bread that filling so you couldnt really taste anything other than the bread "
R0194,The food was good  the wine was good and the waiter was friendly 
R0194,The food was terrible  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone 
R0194,The service was nice  the food  not bad  but the place was extremely noisy and at the end of the meal we smelled as if we had cooked ourselves  We ate downstairs where it had nothing to do with the cosy pictures from upstairs you see on their webpage  I wouldn t go there again 
R0194,The staff was lovely  but the food was disappointing and overpriced given the quality 
R0194,This was a great spot for a group dinner  Close to where we were staying and excellent food and atmosphere  Lovely wine selection  Staff were wonderful too  Highlights included brisket mac and cheese  bangers and mash and slip sole  Highly recommend 
R0194,"Thoroughly disappointed  The place has gotten great reviews and also from friends who have visited it  I honestly dont know how  Upon arriving we awaited for the blonde waitress working there to seat us and after a while with no acknowledgement of our presence I approached her and tried to ask if we could grab a free table and she snapped at us to wait till she was finished  Next we were seated at a dirty table and upon pulling in my chair I got stabbed by a rusty nail sticking out of the chair 

When the girl came back a few minutes later to ask if we were ready to order I asked for a few more moments and got a scowl  Upon ordering from a different and more friendly waitress we were then told that there were no blueberries and later we overheard the table beside us being told there were no sweet potatoes  Seriously these are core ingredients for a good chunk of the menu     

So instead of a blueberry smoothie my girlfriend got a very sour  not so sexy and watery   sexy strawberry smoothie  I in turn reviewed a warm protein power smoothie which while tasty I had to leave cool for a while before drinking  

We both got the fish and sweet potato fries with mint peas  I enjoyed the breaded haddock but the sweet potatoe fries were stone cold and the mint peas had no trace of mint in them  

The restaurant itself was very messy  The floor was absolutely filthy and when we went to pay an astounding  Euro 35 for a highly disappointing meal we saw the kitchen was in an even worse state to the extent that bins were overflowing with rubbish  

All in all was a huge disappointment and we wont be returning "
R0194,"Very noisy harsh environment
You are almost in the kitchen"
R0194,We had a pretty average Sunday brunch here  I was disappointed  based on previous experience  My beetroot burger came on a very dry bun with equally dry chips  and fell apart on attempted eating  It was an eye watering  Euro 19 
R0194,We were seated outside in what seemed like a smoking area of a pub at a wonky table where there was really no atmosphere  i booked outdoor seating and expected something a little more romantic  The food was good but I wouldnt go back purely for that reason 
R0194,"Went with friends in Saturday night  29/04  for dinner  

Decor and tables are nice  well laid out and menu was well presented  Waiter was pleasant and we ordered  Unfortunately from here things started to slide  

Three starters arrived and one a substantial time later  All starters were on the cool side and one was returned to be heated up  This was taken away by another member of staff  When the late stater was brought out the waiter never noticed or commented on the missing starter  

Starters done and onto the main course  Three steaks and a beef wellington  Again one was delivered much later than the other three and again the temperatures were all on the cool side  Not cold but not as hot as would be expected  

Throughout the meal the table was never asked how things were nor was the wine ever poured  all water and wine was poured by ourselves  The bottle of wine  quite a nice one  was finished about halfway through the main course and never noticed  

As we were finishing the mains I noticed the hostess sat down at an empty table behind us to have her dinner  Ive never seen staff eat in the dinning room with customers and when I worked in restaurants in NY and San Diego we didnt even have a glass of water on the floor  When she had finished she left her glass on the table and did not reset it  

So in summary we were extremely disappointed  There was no sense of occasion about the meal  There was zero interest from the staff as evident by lack of table interaction  tardy service  cool food and staff eating in the dinning room  

At this price point things should be much better  quality of ingredients were good but unfortunately thats not enough if you are at the high end of the market "
R0194,The venue is lovely  we had a table by the window upstairs  and we had a very nice waitress  
R0194,Would not recommend Highly unprofessional behaviour from the staff  Totally unacceptable
R0195,Buyer beware  We booked a table here for our last night in Dublin because we wanted a nicer meal away from a noisy pub  When we arrived  our �reservation� was downstairs in the pub  and the menu was basic pub food  An hour after we ordered  we asked where our food was and learned that they had booked a private group in the upstairs restaurant and the kitchen was swamped  20 minutes later  we spoke to the manager and he admitted our food order hadnt been started yet  They treated us like we were being unreasonable  We left hungry 
R0195,"Really bad dry overdone burger  Very bland pulled pork
Mains came while still eating starter  never asked why most food left behind
Overall very disappointing"
R0195,rubbish food and very expensive 
R0195,Underwhelming
R0196,A really great red curry  The decor is a cross between Eyes Wide Shut and Dubstep disco though 
R0196,Absolutely awful food and the worst service we have ever experienced 
R0196,"Burritos and blues was an early player in the Burrito market and that could explain how its held in such high regard  Now that theres stiffer competition out there  I dont think the burritos really match up at all   

I went for a burrito bowl last time which was pretty watered down I thought  the beans were soggy and the rice wasnt the best either  Cant say the complimentary tortilla chips were better either to be honest  

To top it all off  I wasnt a fan of the blues music either  Not an absolutely terrible spot by any means  I dont think it can compete with the competition though  "
R0196,Fabulous food and large portions  We booked in February to get in for August  BYO also   well worth a visit 
R0196,Food amazing   And very friendly staff will defo be back  
R0196,Food is lovely here  Service is slow so dont come here if youre in a hurry as its quite hard to get anyones attention 
R0196,Great burger  I got a double cheeseburger and hand cut fries  Barely touched the fries after this enormous delicious burger  Definitely give it a try 
R0196,Great food in a centrally located restaurant  The outdoor area has a lovely view of the Liffey  Reasonably priced too 
R0196,Great food in a real central part of town  Good price
R0196,Great food  excellent service  The portions were impressive  but were far out ranked by the delicious tastes and flavours 
R0196,Great pizza  lovely brownie dessert  I cant get enough of the botanic aesthetic and friendly staff  10/10 every time
R0196,Great pizza  pitchers of margaritas and lovely atmosphere  Consistently good 
R0196,Great service  with exquisite dishes and a delightful environment  Weve spent our first anniversary there and loved it 
R0196,Had dinner here on 8/3 and it was great  I ordered too much food but enjoyed every bite  �Staff was friendly  place was clean and food up as good  � All I could ask for 
R0196,Had unreal wings as well as Se�n serving class pints the whole night  unreal craic and highly recommended 
R0196,Have been to here several times and have really enjoyed it  However  this time the service was really poor and really slow  One of the waiters kept answering in an obviously annoyed and sharp tone   Didnt make us feel welcome at all   Id say she just felt stressed but it wasnt even that busy    It was really a shame because the restaurant is placed in such a beautiful location  And food was lovely 
R0196,I booked a table in advance and got a very bad table in a corner with barely any space and on top of a group  There wasnt even that many people there  Food was not great  for a pizza place it simply wasnt good enough  White wine was okay  I wouldnt go back there and would not recommend to a friend  Its quality is too poor for me 
R0196,"I get my coffee there in the morning  Its all right  If it wasnt so conveniently placed for me  I probably wouldnt go there 
The food is all right  not too many surprises "
R0196,Unfortunately the food was probably the worst brunch Ive ever had  I had the taco bowl which came swimming in so much liquid the bowl was soggy by the time it got to me  and overall just lacked flavour a key theme for this place  
R0196,I went here for coffee and a pastry a few days ago   Both were fine  However after Id ordered and paid  the woman who had taken my payment went back to preparing some deli salad stuff  Shed just handled my money and then went back to peeling and chopping a cucumber without washing her hands  Fairly gross and if thats the kind of attitude to food safety in the visible food preparation area I dont want to know what its like behind the scenes 
R0196,"Ive eaten here before and found it a good experience  this time  not so much  Having made a reservation I was surprised to be seated in the outdoor area  in an awkward  wobbly table far to close to another party  Outdoor Dining in Dublin in January is brave  and not that pleasant 

Food was OK to average  drinks list good   but the house wine served on tap from the kind of bulk keg that you may find in a low end bar was just awful 

While the team were nice and friendly  service was hit and miss with staff absent from where we were sat most of the time  I dont blame them if I was in their shoes Id be staying somewhere warmer too  

Disappointed following our prior visit  and Id be unlikely to eat here again "
R0196,Ive just had brunch and I have to say it was awful  I had the poached eggs and bacon dish  which comes with homemade fries  Unhappy of my choice  I will definitely not come back  
R0196,Im not quite sure what all the rave is about   a friend recommended this and said this place provided the best dessert he ever had    ever  I would beg to differ  I dont think any American would be caught dead eating what filth we tried    
R0196,Its hardly anything to get excited about Do not waste your money here
R0196,New Years eve dinner horrible experience
R0196,Nice food if over priced  Also the tables inside are too close together  I spent my mean with with the person behind me and myself basically giving each other a back rub  Which isnt ideal 
R0196,Our pizzas were unreal   The girl serving us was so helpful and friendly  Looking forward to going again 
R0196,Pizza was bland; I added potatoes to my pizza and they were basically giant roast potatoes so you couldnt pick up a slice of pizza  Service was shocking   only 2 waitresses for a busy night  Ordered drinks and dessert   drinks arrived 15mins later and no dessert  Bill was incorrect twice 
R0196,pizzas were doughy  and  stodgy  toppings ok  Waitress seemed a bit vague  and  asked if we were finished  and reached for our plates when my friend was less than half way through her food   Poor dessert choices  and  had to get up to pay at the till as we couldnt get the attention of a waitress  Wont be back 
R0196,Really friendly and helpful staff  Thanks  Unusual pizzas  very tasty  Brownie dessert was fantastic 
R0196,Really nice pizza  very nice spot and really friendly staff 
R0196,rubbish food and very expensive  not only it was blant  but it was too chilli hot that I am not able to even eat 1 spoon   and I have been eating spicy food but this was not edible    
R0196,"Service was awful  We were placed in the corner table for two when the restaurant was empty  We complained that there was no space and asked to be relocated and were basically told no  This was shocking since the place was empty  We then asked again could we relocate or we were leaving  we were placed inside  This set everything off on a bad note 
The food was good but over priced  The coke which costs  Euro 3 50 a glass came flat and had to be sent back  It took forever for our table to be cleared  We just wanted to leave at this stage and basically had to walk to the bar as we waited long enough "
R0196,Settings and surroundings not so bad   Now for the bad  Pub was cold   They had a fire that kept smoking out the whole place  It was really bad  The smell of toxic  I actually felt sick and my hair and clothes stank by the time we left  They are in serious need of getting their chimney cleaned  
R0196,Staff was super nice  and  food was great   Reasonably priced   Best fish  and  chips Ive ever had  
R0196,The food is only so so and quite overpriced for what it actually is  I dont know how you can justify nine euro for aubergine fries or sixteen euro for a pizza with only four pieces of chorizo and four slivers of courgette  Very disapointing  Save your money  Friendly staff though 
R0196,The interiors may not impress but the fried cheeses and Czech beers are fantastic  Definitely recommended for a casual meal 
R0196,The place is small  All the tables were full and i have to wait  The food was derlicious  The coffee was amazing  The best place 
R0196,Very limited menu  both with respect to food and wine 
R0196,Way too much cheese on pizzas  really greasy and messy  Cheese was way too overpowering 
R0196,We had a great time  The staff were great  really pleasant and helpful  The food was excellent and we were all stuffed afterwards  Would hugely recommend 
R0196,We had an awesome evening  The waiters  the food and the cocktails were great  We enjoyed every minute there 
R0196,"We were wandering around Blackrock and noticed this place and decided to give it a try for dinner  �The place looked good   clean  good service  fast prep  �However  once we got home to savour our meal  we were truly disappointed  �We both got Pad Thai   the noodles were incredibly dry  the overall flavour was lacking  and the chicken left much to be desired  � 

The next night or so we tried another Thai place in the city that was 100x better  �Avoid if youre looking for your thai fix "
R0196,Would have been better going to a petrol station
R0196,Wouldnt recommend to be honest   maybe got bad day but this was my experience 
R0197,"9 of us had dinner on saturday night and from the start to the end we all had great crack  
tom murphy"
R0197,"Absolutely loved our night with thunder Road  Staff are friendly happy people 
Food was great all   all in all top marks"
R0197,After getting the social living voucher for  Euro 60 worth of food I got a steak that was a  Euro 5 surcharge and a childs meal which was  Euro 6:95 plus one coke and still had to pay  Euro 32 on top of the  Euro 60 voucher  Chicken wings starter  were nice but had to call the waitress after an hour to get our main course  Table was booked for 5:15 so theres no need for such a delay also ordered a ice from the kids meal which wasnt giving
R0197,"Ah had such high hopes for this place  looks so lovely from the outside  and the menu reads very well but it was decidedly average  The decor is lovely inside  all soft twinkly lighting  cream leather and dark woods  the walls lined with craft beers and wine  its all very bijou and I loved it  but unfortunately the food just wasnt very memorable  

As we were eating straight after work we went with the Early bird menu which allows you to choose from the first four options on the starter and main menu  �I decided to pay the  Euro 3 supplement for a starter of jambalaya rice balls as none of the other options tempted me  They were tasty and served with a flavoursome gravy and definitely the highlight of the meal for me  though I dont think they merited the supplementary price  

I had the lamb burger for my main  which was good but a little uninspired  again there was a supplement if you wanted extras with it and without these it was nothing out of the ordinary  I had to ask for some mayonnaise as it was a little dry with just the relish that accompanied it 

I feel there are plenty of places in this part of the city offering better food in the same price range so while it wasnt terrible by any means it just wasnt good enough to woo me back anytime soon "
R0197,All pre made food with sauce over it  this place is not what it was years ago  Toilets were very dirty 
R0197,Amazing food  atmosphere and staff  Good value for money too 
R0197,attented last sunday table was not ready which was ok   we went to the bar to be left standing at the bar for 40 minutes to be served  bar staff were very rude and even used very bad language at my friend  food service was fast which was fine food arrived we had no cutlery naplins etc table had not been set  food was very over priced for the portion  5 chicken wings in a bowl which were horrible frozen wings without doubt  steak was nothing to talk about with a few chips on the side so very poor for the price  biggest complaint was the drink service the wait for a drink was awful  and finally we had to keep our coats on as it was warmer outside the cold air was very over powering indeed  so overall not a good exprience money down the drain really  i cannot fault our waiter he did try his best to keep up with our table it was the bar staff who let him down 
R0197,Booked a table in advance and still had to wait near 20 mins for my table  the waiter was so rude and only half our order came out  the food was very over priced for what it was
R0197,DJ was the only thing that made up for poor food and service  Wouldnt go back
R0197,Every thing was aok and i be back this Sunday 30/06/2019 for a table for 6
R0197,First time and we are very happy with the Gelato  The mango  lemon and salted Carmel are very good 
R0197,Food great  Loved the light on the table to get attention from staff  Best burger Ive had in years  Would definitely eat there again    
R0197,Food isnt great at all for the price you pay  good for cocktails thats about it
R0197,Food not great  steak  although other guests with us said the burgers were outstanding   Left waiting over 30 minutes for food to come out   Service was not great 
R0197,Food was fab service was outstanding
R0197,Food was served really quick everything was perfect music food atmosphere
R0197,"From start  had table booked for 6 46 we arrived early about 6 20  i diddent mind waiting as our time was 6 45  we were stil waiting at 7 20 for table  finally got a table at 7 28    we ordered our drinks and food  and jug of water  the drinks arrived   den our food  came   no  knifes or forks or napkins  stil waiting on the girl to come back i went looking for  staff  all were bissey   we sat with our food on the table  for 10 mins  food was going cold  and we never got out water   
  Normally i lv going here but after that well give it  a break"
R0197,Good buzz around pride   staff are very polite  great service
R0197,Great atmosphere  great food  They had cocktail deals on  The staff were lovely and friendly
R0197,Great evening  food was lovely  the atmosphere was great  I eat here regularly and I never can fault it  Thank you 
R0197,"Had voucher so got a different menu but to be fair plenty of options on it so no issue here but surely we should be asked if we would like a drink before waiter leaves us but no that didnt happen  
Food and drink ordered together but half way through starter I had to ask were our drinks were  That is unacceptable as drinks should be first out  You are also losing out on repeat orders  
Deal included 2 cocktails but these were awful and watery  I can only guess that deal cocktails are pre made as I could see other customers getting cocktails that looked fresh and a lot better than our ones 
Food was OK  Not the nicest wings I have ever had  should be smaller wings  My main was Thai curry and was just about warm when it arrived so cold by the time I had mid way through  My wife had the enchiladas and they were lovely 
We were never asked did we want another drink I had to call someone cleaning a table to send someone over who could take our order  Ordered beer and wine and waitress asked about cocktails as they were barely touched  We told her they were watery and horrible so she said she would check this out but this was the last we heard of it  She brought our new drinks and said nothing about cocktail  We thought maybe the drinks we ordered would not be on the bill but they were 
Overall experience was poor and despite having a living social voucher was not worth the money  Including voucher we spent  Euro 62:50 so dont really feel like we fit any sort of deal as service was awful and food poor to fair and dont mention the Cocktails "
R0197,"I booked online for this place  I was hoping to have the table for a while as we were planning on having a 3 course meal and a few drinks  However  upon arrival I was informed that we would only have the table for an hour and a half  which I feel I should have been told when booking  

Some of the waiters were quite nice  although there was one waiter who didnt have any time for us and when giving us the cutlery  he threw it on the table in front of my face  My friend was also given the wrong main course by this waiter who was very short with her and kept saying that she ordered what she was given  

The noise was quite high which was expected but the music was great  

I probably wont be returning as a result of being rushed to eat and drink and the terrible service from one of the waiters "
R0197,I got the wings n ribs combo and it was delicious  i loved the atmosphere and the staff were very efficient and helpful i will definitely be returning
R0197,I made a booking for 4 people and they tried to give me a table for 2  we waited over an hour for our mains and had to ask the staff where our food was 2/3 times  As a waitress myself I usually wouldnt complain but I know myself if a customer is left waiting that long we usually offer free desserts or drinks to make up for it  Wasnt impressed 
R0197,I usually have nothing but great experiences in here however on this occasion it was appalling  My own main course arrived out 10 mins after everyone else received theirs by that time everyone was nearly done eating   Two other members of our party had to cancel their orders as it was taking to long to arrive out   It took far to long to order and receive drinks   We could not wait to leave and get the bill  Over all it was a disaster and the service was not up to its usuall standards which was very disappointing 
R0197,"I was in town yesterday for a bit of shopping with the mother  We deicided to go for something to eat and have a drink  The Ireland match was on and everywhere was jam packed  

We ended up here  unfortunately   First of all it was very cramped  I couldnt get into my seat because there was someone at the table behind me  Some tables were moved to facilitate a group of four which meant we couldnt actually get out without people have to move  

We both ordered the Guinness steak pie with mash and when it can out the first thing I noticed was how unappealing it looked  Then when we tasted it it was FREEZING COLD  We had no choice but to hand it back  When it came back out it was hot but we were slightly turned off  Honestly it was just ok  

In my opinion the food is substandard  overpriced for what you get and the staff seem over worked and not happy to be there  "
R0197,I was very disappointed with the food ordered a steak sandwich and the meat wasnt up to scratch at all   Id ordered it to be cooked medium and it arrived more well done  We hadnt been here in a while but we wont be returning 
R0197,Iv came here a few times and loved it but took my mother and all my sisters here for mothers day and we where very dissapointed in the food we sent back 2 items because they werent even able to eat thats how bad the food was my ma was afraid to send hers back and same went for me its a pity cos I recommend this place to everyone and I work in a hotel so I sent all my costumes there when they visit Ireland   
R0197,Loved it food was great and loved the pitchers of beer
R0197,Me and my partner booked a table for Saturday Feb 9 it was very busy we were seated quickly we waited half hour for our food I had chicken fajitas as I always do he had steak his dinner was burnt he couldnt eat it my chicken was dried up we werent charged for the food but it ruined our night I am going here on Feb 23 with girls from work hope its a better experience
R0197,Most of the food was cold  My daughter ordered the fillet steak with mash and onion rings her mash and onion rings were freezing cold and sent them back only to receive more mash which was again cold she eventually got hot mash when her steak was finished and no onion rings when we relayed this she received a bowl of rings that looked and tasted like a bowl of rings from a frozen packet  The desert arrived 45 minutes later  The cocktails included and the 8 extra we ordered were also very poor  My family and I used to go all together for a Christmas party there but I can safely say we will not be going again and I would tell friends not to buy the voucher 
R0197,My self and 3 others went before a gig on Saturday 3 out of 4 of us had steak which was lovely we got 2 steaks brought out with the other meal  but the 3rd steak came out 10 min later we where all finished eating buy that time my sister got hers   Tbh ruined our evening I was always a big fan of this place but tbh I dont think Ill be back
R0197,Nothing special about cafe  Thought theyd do something for my 11 year olds birthday but they didnt even wish him happy birthday even though I emailed in advance  Food was only ok 
R0197,Big chain pizza place up the road is far far tastier  The service isnt awful but there is that element of feeling like youre on someone elses turf with the staff  I wouldnt mind that attitude if the food was spectacular  home made type  but I was disappointed  Tasteless pizza 
R0197,Poor value  Would not return  Good very average  My chair was a bit lopsided  For  Prices charged they should do better 
R0197,Said it was for a birthday we go every year for my 15 year old sisters birthday and wrote on the booking it was for a birthday they usually sing happy birthday to her when we go and she loves it thats why we always come back for her birthday but not this time and floor staff very rude then you ask for something
R0197,Service was appalling  Server couldnt have been more disinterested in us  felt like we were an inconvenience to him  Noise level was awful  kids running riot and overall ambience was disastrous  Would not recommend or ever bother going back  It was a coin toss between here or The Hard Rock Cafe  Wish wed gone there instead  Most disappointing  Euro 100 + Ive ever spent 
R0197,Staff is so friendly and food is amazing   Always come here and each time I come back with a smile on my face always have a great time 
R0197,Starter was zinger tenders tasted lovely but 4 very very small tenders   nachos where lovely tho  Main was horrible chips where disgusting garlic mayo ontop tasted gone off and plain chips tasted like they where over fried    Chicken was dry and tasteless  Wont be returning
R0197,The best steakhouse in Town  Premium irish beef  my favourite is the rib Eye on the bone  Expensive but worth it
R0197,The food had been left sitting as childs burger bun hard  my sizzling hot plate with peppers and onions were soggy  cheese was hard  not that pleasent   Toilet was dirty   Sorry  but wont be back  but on the plus side  your staff are lovely 
R0197,"The food was ok this time  everything tasted a little too over done  They have taken pasta off the menu  not ideal for those who dont like burgers  or tex mex  
Probably wont be back again but only due to the food  Service was good  staff were friendly"
R0197,"The menu has taking away my favourite foods which was pretty disappointing  
The dish that I did get has changed alot and lacked in taste and was much smaller than usual  The menu is to basic now you can get a burger any where dont need to travel to temple bar for it "
R0197,The quality off food has gone downhill   the chicken wings had a horrible smell  the burger was no more than a burger from a regular joint  and  the kids chicken nuggets were from Iceland  I cant see this place surviving with this quality of food  I was in another place the week before  and  the quality of food was outstanding   I wont be returning or recommending this place
R0197,The waiting time to place an order and then for food to arrive was way too long even taking into consideration that the restaurant was very busy   They have plenty of staff that were happy to play with each others hair     and clear empty tables instead of taking our order  Over an hour from when we arrived  on time for pre booked table  to when we got the food  Once the food arrived it was only half correct  The ribs and wings combo on the menu specifically says the wings are suppose to be buffalo yet they were smothered in the BBQ sauce same as the ribs  Ribs were the only decent food we got that night  The steak fajita which we eventually got  steak sandwich arrived first  was lacking in flavour  dont think any salt or pepper was used at all  and chips were cold  As we were in a hurry we asked for the bill once the meal arrived  We had to chase the bill again after we finished eating  Generally very disappointing meal and overall experience  Wont be back 
R0197,There were two stag parties shouting and swinging chairs around  was really rowdy  so loud you couldnt hear each other speak  couldnt wait to leave   wont be returning 
R0197,They were quite quiet so the staff were a little over attentive  again nothing necessarily wrong with that  Im just picking at things and I was hungover so wanted to be left alone  
R0197,This has a great selection for city centre grocery store  Very clean  Staff are friendly  its in the centre  Worth a call in 
R0197,This is a typical tourist trap y museum cafe  I only stopped in here for a coffee  but the menu options looked pretty good  I imagine this wouldnt be a bad choice for lunch if you were already in the castle 
R0197,This was my 3rd time  had a brilliant experience the first 2 times so brought 2 friends with me this time   Ordered cocktails skittles and strawberry daiquiri  but the waiter advised this couldnt be made as they didnt have the ingredients    He advised they ran out after a busy weekend   This is now Tuesday surely they would have restocked    Order a sharing platter to start and then 3 main courses   Waiting ages and then waiter came with our main course   we advised we hadnt recieved our starter yet   He took the food back and led rita under the heater and got us the sharing platter and then brought us the  main course that was left sitting under heaters   The food was still tasty but an overall disappointing experience
R0197,Though the food was tasty for a burger joint  there are many other places that can beat its  Euro 35 a head  without alcohol     The huge downer was the loudness of the DJ   While the music was generally some that I like e g  reggae  the volume was so loud that we couldnt talk to each other and I felt like I had Post Traumatic Stress after I left   The red/white table light was a great idea for calling service 
R0197,Used living social great deal food and cocktails lovely
R0197,Very disappointed this time round  I bought the voucher as a birthday present for a friend  I always buy the vouchers when available  however we were handed a 2 course set menu  which has never happened before and not a great choice on it    After we had our starters we had to call someone after an hour to see what happened our main meal  When it came mine was cold and sent it back  It came back to me within 5 mins so it was reheated  this is not good when its a burger  We didnt get desserts  my friend ordered a drink and I ordered a coffee which I got 15 minutes after my friend got her drink  When I complained when I was paying they took the surcharge off the bill  This place has gone down hill big time  Safe to say I wont be back  What was supposed to be a birthday celebration for my friend was ruined from start to finish   Our booking was for 5 o clock so it wasnt overly busy
R0197,Very noisy and full of children at 8pm  Not at all relaxing or enjoyable because of this 
R0197,Waited 40 mins for bland dry food  kids meal was the worst
R0197,Waited 45 minutes for food to arrive while several other tables who arrived later were served before us  Received the wrong bill from the server 
R0197,"The worst experience  there were SEVEN  yes SEVEN hairs in my meal which disgusted me so much I couldnt finish it 

I have never come on web to leave a negative review before but this was by far the worst food experience I have had in Dublin "
R0197,Was really looking forward to visiting my favourite restaurant in town  but was very disappointed as the menu has changed and there is not as much choice anymore  Sad to say we wont be visiting again  The food wasnt the best the chicken wings were dry and burger was like rubber overpriced fast food and  Euro 8 for a dessert  is ridiculous     I definitely will not be recommending to friends anymore its a shame  The only positive was the staff are still great 
R0197,We booked our table for 9pm   we arrived 15 minutes before our time but we werent shown to our table until 9 40   we ordered our food which took a further 25 minutes   I ordered thunder zingers but received regular chicken strips with no sauce   At this stage I didnt care as we were already in a rush to be somewhere else so i sent them back and had nothing   they took them off the bill which was nice but I was already annoyed that we had to wait 40 minutes before getting our table after being there early to make it more convenient for them   very bad experience
R0197,We didnt have a good experience the food was cold my wife gave back her dinner and we waited between 40 45 minutes for our main course after the starters we where here many times before and it was nice but this time wasnt good what so ever
R0197,We had a wonderfull evening  Staff is very kind  food is great and the restaurant is a hidden pearl in Dublin   
R0197,We had to wait a long time for someone to serve us  Our food was cold and I couldnt finish my meal becuase It was turning my stomach  The prices for the food were too much for the quality 
R0197,We were disappointed this time as the menu has changed  There was a smell of sick from the table cloth which we had to get cleaned  The chicken wings were dry and we needed to order more sauce  the garlic bread looked and tasted like it was from Aldi   We ordered desert and after waiting 20 minutes we were told it would take about another 15 minutes so we cancelled it   We have eaten here many times before but were really disappointed this time and wont be rushing back 
R0197,Went here for my daughters birthday as a group  The staff were very friendly and accommodating  The food was excellent  reasonably priced  The facility was very baby friendly aswell  Id highly recommend
R0197,"Working in Hospitality management I was pretty appalled by the level of service 

We were finished our starters before our drinks arrived  my water glass was chipped  we only had 1 knife and fork and when we asked for another one they took the bucket with the one we had and brought back just one  
So we still had one knife and fork and had to ask again 

Very poor  Wont be back "
R0197,Worst food I have ever had  Starters were cold   Dinner had no taste   Took forever to even get dinner    Stay away from this place 
R0198,"185 euro for a meal for 2 is too much
one starter
on desert
cheese board
bottle of wine
2 mains
2 extra glasses of wine
4 sides"
R0198,A bit expensive and ive eaten better stakes in other places  Nice atmosphere though
R0198,Amazing steaks and the spicy Kalamari starter was really lovely  Would go again 
R0198,amazing        nothing more but amazing
R0198,Beautiful steak and sides  Staff really friendly but professional
R0198,"Best coffee in Dublin city    

should come in here and congratulate them"
R0198,Brilliant food and service  would 100 percent recommend  and will be back again 
R0198,Everything from the top to bottom was amazing  Fantastic wine list and entree specific recommendations  Very attentive staff all around 
R0198,Great food   Wendy was fantastic  Easy to get to  lovely place 
R0198,Great meat and sides  We came in late and didnt expect much but were surprised  If ever in Dublin again well come back 
R0198,Great service  One of the steak was burnt and a little over cooked but apart from that we had a lovely night  I would recommend 
R0198,"Had a business dinner there and the staff and ambiance was pleasant   The menu is expensive and from this I ordered a medium rare T bone steak   The steak was cooked medium and this took away from my experience   The waitress did ask if everything was ok  but I felt that this was more of a comment than a genuine enquiry   I explained that my steak was not to my satisfaction   however   I declined to have it replaced as this would have created an awkward situation with my guest eating while I have no food   And   it does take a long time for food to arrive 

While the restaurant is pleasant  with prices of c Euro 34 38 for our steaks  before accompaniments  there is absolutely no excuse or scope for presenting the main ingredient overdone 

Quite disappointing "
R0198,The lamb curry was sweet and didnt even come close to the depth of flavor at any Indian place wed been to  The short rib  chicken  and fish ball were ok    but nothing memorable  Not awful  but we were pretty disappointed to pay 80 euros when we could have probably had better food at an Indian takeout place 
R0198,Had to send my steak back twice was too over cooked  But the biggest let disappointment was the chief had the bright idea of rubbing the steak in origano prior to cooking  And also did this with my partners burger  Why anyone would want the flavour of there steak ruining by been over powered with a very strong tasting herb is beyond me  The man just couldnt grasp rare  No offer to knock anything off the bill despite the steak been sent back a 2nd time  Overall very disappointing 
R0198,Hard to forgive a steakhouse for over cooking a steak 
R0198,Have eaten in your premises twice previously and could not complain about anything however on this occasion we were both very disappointed  We started with the Calamari which was over salted   we then ordered the tomahawk steak for two   we were informed that this would take the best part of an hour however it was served to us within 30 minutes of having ordered it   the meat itself was beautifully cooked however we felt that the portion of meat served was very small for the amount charged  indeed the board was covered in an excessive amount of onion rings   they were just heaped and it seemed they were filling the board just for the sake of it   we ordered two sauces and both were on the salty side   to say we were not happy is a bit of an understatement  It will be a while before we might consider visiting again   if ever  
R0198,I had scallops to start and fillet steak for main  the food was flawless  However the service was poor and we were left for long periods without water or drinks
R0198,"Im not Irish  Im Catalan    So  maybe these comments havent got added value for everyone  
In general  the food is good  especially the starters  steak tartar and Korean calamari   In the other hand for me the meat was too grilled  we asked for a blue range 
Furthermore  the prices are higher than other options with the same product "
R0198,Ive been going here every now and again for years but never again  I ordered the vegetarian lasagne and after a few bites realised Id gotten a meat lasagne  When I asked about this the dish was replaced with no real apology or recognition  
R0198,Incredible food  Reasonable  And the best service ever    Great to sit outside over breakfast or lunch  Never rushed 
R0198,Made a reservation   got there and they did not have a table available   They put my at the counter next to the open flame grill  which was extremely hot    Then they forgot about me  I was moved a few chairs down where it was still warm but not as hot  Ordered food and waited almost an hour for it to arrive   When they say they give 2 hours per table  it is because thats about how long it takes to get your food   The chef sent a side dish as an apology for the long wait   The couple next to me had a long wait as well and was given the same side dish  I noticed she did not eat some of her steak due to how raw it was   Mine was good but not at the level that I expected for the price I was paying   I asked for water and never received my request   I was also there for a special occasion which was noted on the reservation   Which they did not see  All in all  there are better restaurants in the Dublin  Temple bar area  that are much better and not as expensive   This has the potential to be good but not there yet 
R0198,"Not great experience  We ordered an 18oz steak and the ""whole baked skate""  Steak was about 10oz at most and I got a single small skate wing  The cocktails were nice"
R0198,Nothing special  Steak and burger were only okay  Lacked flavour  seasoning  Sides were tasty enough but priced at  Euro 5 each they would want to be  Desserts were dull  Expensive for what you get  Staff were good  Wouldnt be rushing back and wouldnt be recommending  Far better places for steak in Dublin 
R0198,Ordered Delminico and Sirlion steaks and disappointed that meat was tough  Salads were very good  Probably would not go back  Quality of food for price was not worth it 
R0198,Ordered fillet steak medium done and it was raw in the center  ordered side salad and was charged 6 euro for a bowl of lettuce leaves   parmasan chips were awful  Starters of crab crochet were nice but only 2 tiny ones on plate   not one drink on list of beers or cocktails that were nice  we had had enough so didnt order desserts  we love to eat out but this was probably worst experience eating out ever  tables on top of each other couldnt even what my partner was saying as the French couple beside us were speaking so loud  had problems getting in and out to go to the loo because we were practically on top of the table beside us squeezed into a tiny corner  never again
R0198,Our meal and service was excellent   Thanks so much  
R0198,Our waiter was extremely nice and so was the food  Nothing to complain about  10/10  My best restaurant experience ever 
R0198,Perfekt Thanx for the Great Dinner  Perfect steaks ans Service 
R0198,Probably the most tasteless steak ive had  very very dissapointed we all were  wine was terrible  House wine  46 euro  Desert i wanted they ran out of and the one i got looked like it came from iceland grocery store  Fx buckley is miles ahead
R0198,Probably the best food Ive ever had  Honestly if you dont go here  youre really dumb 
R0198,"Rather than going for a main  we decided to go for a bunch of starters  we had a voucher to blow on  Euro 30  as neither of us were particularly starved  
On the whole  it was okay  not great not bad but definitely not the kind of place Ill be running back to  But then �I wouldnt scream blue murder about meeting someone here either if pushed to "
R0198,"Really poor crepes  Doughy   rubbery and chewy  Even two kids didnt finish theirs     Euro 14 50 for 3  
I also asked for a smaller one for myself   Same price as large 
Stick to the ice creams here   Such a pity because really  how hard is it to make a good pancake   "
R0198,service too late  we wait more than an hour to receive our meals  meat was good but not exceptional  I probably would not come back
R0198,Service was absolutely shocking  Waited over an hour for our food which totally spoilt our night 
R0198,Service was awful  the host was our waiter for half of the meal  and the food took so long  we did not order any appetizer and we waited for the main way too long  The food was delicious though 
R0198,Service was great and the food was amazing  Would recommend
R0198,Service was slow and very overpriced  Selection of starters was poor  Steaks are sold on there own   have to pay for sauce and sides seperate  Nice setting but will not be returning with them prices  Crazy to pay  Euro 120 for 2 main courses and a couple of bottles of water 
R0198,"Steak was overcooked  pepper sauce was watery  
Service was very slow and was overpriced for the quality of the food  no starters no desserts just two main courses and three drinks and  Euro 140  Much better value in other restaurants around town  Definitely wont be rushing back and would not be recommending to friends "
R0198,The best steak I have had in Dublin went for my birthday had an amazing night staff were excellent Ill definitely be back thanks a lit 
R0198,The chicken wings are just the absolute best  Charcoal grilled spicy pieces that compete with any backyard barbecue  So good 
R0198,The food was incredible and our server Wendy was fantastic  Extremely accommodating to our every need  Cant wait to visit again 
R0198,The restaurant was not as i expected  I was really disappointed
R0198,Theres only one word to describe this place and that word is unreal  would 100 percent recommend
R0198,Thought the food was good but nothing special expected better than received I have made better at home and was disappointed when I was there and that the tomahawk what we had been looking forward to getting wasnt there  Just bad timing really but still disappointing
R0198,Valentine night; limited choice of 3 main and at  Euro 65 a head its expensive   Euro 200 all in for 2 with 1 bottle of wine  Beef was chewy  so for a steakhouse thats a bad sign
R0198,Very disappointing experience  Food was rather bland and service was very slow  Changed servers during the meal  Had to go to bar for a refill on my drink 
R0198,Very good meal   steak was excellent  Will be back
R0198,Visiting Dublin from Boston for a few days and luckily found this gem   One of the best Filet Mignon steaks Ive ever had   
R0198,We arrived on time with the restaurant nice and quite  we were taken to our table which was in a nice quite corner but thats where the fun stoped  we waited 20 mins and then I had to ask if we could have a drink   we ordered our food and then waited 1 hr for the starters whitch were underwhelming to say the least  after a further 30 mins the stakes arrived and both over cooked  the staff were pretty uninterested  The table next to us complained quite strongly    to say tomahawk needs a shake up is an understatement    and all for 160 euro     come on    sort yourselves out it wasnt even busy   
R0198,We booked for a Christmas lunch  we were presented with a set menu we knew  I thing about  There were no other options  We had small starters  our steak was over cooked and even when I told the waiter he seemed pretty uninterested  The place was almost totally empty at 2pm on the Saturday before Xmas so there was zero ambience 
R0198,Went to my first meetup brunch on a Sunday afternoon  Place had a great buzz  good food  lovely waiting staff  Except the floor manager  you could definitely do with a change there   We had table booked for 10  only 3 turned up  After an hour  manager came over asking will there be more people coming  the meetup organiser has apologised and said no  The manager said about 3 times we had booking for 10 in a rather rude and annoyed manner  made us feel very uncomfortable  We all have apologised at that stage  not that it was our fault   To my knowledge all reservation bookings have about 15 min  If no turn up  staff could have come over and taken the 3 tables away  It took him about 3 minutes to sort out  Gratuity was added to the bill  for the group of 3   without any acknowledgement  which I think was very poor  When leaving the restaurant  we all were given very cold goodbye by Mr Grumpy  �To me as a customer  staff is as important as the food  and he has ruined the whole experience  �I would not be rushing back 
R0198,what about     my husband and I were for dinner at this fantastic place    great food and presented beautifully   
R0198,When I made reservation I j dictated it will be a birthday occasion  However the restaurant did not acknowledge when we arrive so I did not jbsist
R0199,Acceptable Italian  convenient to theater  Served the pastas way before the fish and pizza 
R0199,Delicious Authentic Italian pasta highly recommended
R0199,"First time we ate here  tasty fish and chips  
Was happy that it was open late after attending a carol service at Church "
R0199,Food was delicious  the staff were friendly  Only issue was that we were waiting 45 minutes for our food  Other than that  no complaints 
R0199,Great busy bar with classic Irish music  The food was great and I was really looking for good bangers and mash  It was delicious  Great spot 
R0199,Great pasta last night   lasagne  special lasagne  tagiolini and ravioli   all tasty and freshly cooked  Decent house wine and pudding were amazing
R0199,Really good food at a really good price 
R0199,Restaurant is a favourite of mine have eaten here several times and I always come back as the food is delicious and staff inviting and good value for the price 
R0199,"The restaurant had no record of my reservation as they say they do not have a account with app

I would call instead of using this site "
R0199,The service was second to none and the whole atmosphere was exactly what you want when you go for an evening meal  It was also nice to be surrounded by wine no matter where you looked  Living up to their name
R0199,Two starters and three mains  The roasted beets and pork sausages were the highlight for me  risotto and lamb shank were superb according to my fellow diners  Could not recommend this highly enough 
R0199,Very nice and tasty food  Naan bread tastes so good  My family loves coming here for occasional meals  Staff is very kind and helpful  Usually very good service  Would recommend
R0199,Very nice staff  good pizza  great drinks and cosmos that are not that expensive  Nice  relaxed environment  Free WIFI  Just ask for the password 
R0199,We stumbled in here while walking around Dublin  The barista does very impressive cappuccino art  Upon ordering he asked us if we wanted him to draw anything in particular and he ended up drawing some cartoon versions of us in our drinks  Very cute 
R0200, The early bird menu was what i went for but i was disappointed as the soup I ordered had more liquid in them than anything mentioned on the menu  Main course was decent although it lacked a sense of spice to it   
R0200,Its in a great location and interior is very nice and comfortable
R0200,Always a great experience with attentive staff
R0200,Booked a table for 7 for Fathers day and it was a complete disaster from the start  we will not be going back even after the manager trying to do his best  It would take too long to say what went wrong 
R0200,"Dined there for a mid week lunch    

Found menu very limited as we were looking for something light like a fancy sandwich and side order  Menu states �burgers and sandwiches� but there isnt a sandwich on the menu  Confusing  

Ended up ordering pizzas as little else appealed 

Waitress delivered two glasses of water to table    warm and unpleasant  Asked for a glass of cold water and this arrived  Why not serve it in the first place 

We were seated near the kitchen serving area and observed the chef adding fried pepperoni slices from a pan directly onto the top of one pizza when it was sitting on the hot counter waiting to be collected     When the pizzas eventually arrived  they were soggy underneath and one was cremated around the side   The slices of pepperoni were greasy and curled up 

Ordered two coffees which were lovely  Cannot fault service and interior of restaurant  Bill was around 34 euro  Would not visit again for weekday lunch 

Its great but quality and choice  for a restaurant this size  could be improved "
R0200,Felt staff were a little disorganized   we  waited a while to be served and seemed to be no orgisnation
R0200,Good quality food  Good value  Great service  Staff were so nice  Lovely setting 
R0200,Great ambiance  Impeccable service  Relaxed  Tucked away  Guaranteed good food changed weekly  Locally sourced 
R0200,Great food  very friendly staff  Lots of room and very fast service 
R0200,Hamburger not cooked almost raw wine by glass limited
R0200,"Following this food  I ran to the bathroom and lets just say  I was pretty hungry afterwards

R0200,Like all = Cafes very hit or miss with the food and service  Eggs and avocado come different every time  Child friendly though 
R0200,"Long delay after we ordered our staters   My calamari were not piping hot when they finally arrived    My friend was happy with her tempura fish  
After another long delay we were then told they were out of mussels and would my friend consider ordering something else      
She declined and I then cancelled my main course  We were offered two coffees on the house   The manager apologized and said they were under staffed and werent expecting it to be so busy that lunch time     Friday lunchtime     
Was a very disappointing experience at this cafe    "
R0200,Lovely decor and ambience in her   Tasty chicken wings 
R0200,Lovely Fathers Day brunch  excellent service and great food  Well be back 
R0200,Most fantastic young man waited in our table  Food ok but kitchen can not seem to follow requests   Second time there and second time order wrong
R0200,Not exactly thrilled with my experience   We went for the bacon and eggs on the brunch menu and when I asked for no fries and possibly a sausage the lady serving us said I couldnt swap but for an extra charge I could get it  For  Euro 15 I expected more  When the food came it wasnt exactly roasting and went cold very quickly as the plates were cold  Not too sure s return for brunch
R0200,Not good value for money  Two of us had a Pellegrino  one glass of wine  one Roma pizza and dough balls   Euro 33 before tip  Its quite bog standard pizza 
R0200,"The door staff are shameful  no other words 

Standing outside in a packed out smoking area  I got pushed up against the barriers by some of my friends only moments later to feel someone push me from the other side of the barrier  I turned around to see one of the two door men shout at me ""get the fuck up  dont lean on the fucking barriers"" 
"
R0200,Our server was super  very friendly  and  helpful but unfortunately  1  there were no scones at all so 4 of the party only had a choice of croissants  2  the lady who ordered decaf coffee had to ask twice for it  by time it came her croissant was finished  15 mins approx  and   3  after nearly 25 minutes my eggs hadnt arrived  the rest of the group had finished everything  I then said that if if wasnt cooked  to cancel it  The waitress came out with complimentary toast  and  a coffee instead however I would have preferred to get what I ordered on time  I know there was a large group there just ahead of us but I presume they had a booking as we had  there obviously werent enough staff in the kitchen  and  those staff on the floor could do nothing except apologise to us 
R0200,Overall a good experience but both people at our table that ordered the lasagna had to return it for being cold 
R0200,Place was fine  Food wasnt bad just fairly mediocre  Waiter was really friendly and nice  we had to wait so long to get our food each course and the place wasnt even that busy   Wasnt good value but didnt break the bank  Overall just fairly Meh
R0200,really enjoyable brunch  staff were very friendly and service was brilliant  would highly recommend  nice and spacious too if you have little ones who need a buggy 
R0200,"Service was poor   restaurant was not full and we had to look for someone every time we wanted something   
Food was ok   The breakfast menu had six types of poached eggs and two of our party got them and they were cold   I got scrambled eggs which I would have made better myself   they were over cooked   The eggs were served in a bowl and the toast on a board   bizarre "
R0200,Service was terrible   restaurant was quiet yet it was impossible to catch waitresses attention  we had to go get our own cutlery twice  one meal was forgotten so ended up half hour later than other  chips were undercooked and late coming out   the rest of the food was good and we are local so we really hope you improve the service
R0200,Service  food  ambience are what makes a restaurant great  These are evident here in abundance  from start to finish the experience was excellent
R0200,Simple breakfast of bacon/poached eggs way too expensive    coffee/tea and juice not included   would not go back or recommend
R0200,Thanks so much for a lovely birthday lunch for me and my family 
R0200,The amount of food you get for the price is good  but the quality is poor  More like a fast food place that tries to appear healthy  The blonde romanian woman who served me at the till was incredibly rude and nasty  Id rather find a place to spend my money where the people are decent and friendly 
R0200,The disappointment was the absence of the fillet steak from the menu   Last time they were �out of it   Now its no longer on the menu   First world problem certainly but a reason for me not to visit again anytime soon 
R0200,"There is only one reason to go to this place  An I really mean ONLY ONE  
That is  when everything else in town is closed and you are starving  

If you find yourself in Dublin at 11pm and you are famished  you can go here and grab some mediocre  at best  best food and pay an arm and a leg for it  

Otherwise stay away "
R0200,This was a sad experience   Me and three other friends wanted some easy going food day before New Year  The food is actually one of the worst disapointment ever  especialy after the high rating and recommendation
R0200,We actually never got to try the food as the table was booked for 1pm we were seated at 1:15pm  our order was taken at 1:25pm and then at 1:50pm our food had still not arrived and we were told it would be another couple of minutes so we had to leave as our lunch break was over  The staff didnt seem to care that we were leaving without eating  Never had this experience with any other restaurants in the area they have no problem catering for peoples lunch breaks 
R0200,We had a reservation but the hostess still told us to wait at the bar in a very brash manner  We were given a table where we were on top of the people next to us  When our food came  we werent asked if we needed anything else and I had to flag down another waitress for ketchup and maple syrup  My pancakes came completely plain and others around me had toppings on them  The food itself was tasteless and over priced  Then we had to go up to the front door to pay after waiting 15 minutes for someone to ask us if we need a anything else  Will not be returning 
R0200,We had a wonderful evening  Very prompt and friendly service  Well be back
R0200,We waited over 25min for food to arrive  when it eventually arrived it was freezing  eggs under cooked and bread was not even toasted  When we asked the waiter to have our bread toast as per original order it returned burnt  Coffee was extremely good  but such a pity the food was of such a poor standard  ruined our brunch 
R0200,We were seated right beside the kitchen and experience a constant smell of burning  which was quite unpleasant  Recommend to ask to be seated towards the front  away from the kitchen  Service was pleasant but our order was mixed up 3 4 times and some items didnt arrive 
R0200,Went here for a Christmas work lunch   party of 11  Starters came on time but main courses came before starters were finished with many people not getting their full order  sides and sauces missing  or food incorrectly cooked  steak well done vs medium   Plates were cold and wet  One person only got their main course when everyone else was finished  Didnt bother staying for desserts and coffee  Manager did discount our bill by 20 percent as recompense 
R0200,Would not go back  Food arrived before coffee  Egg poached too long was probably cooked a long time   cold bacon  Didnt have my coffee either  tasted really bad  And had to get my own water from the service station as wasnt offered  Looks good inside pity it doesnt deliver food and drink wise
R0200,"You get a main course  for over  Euro 10  then you dont get any side at all  You have to order a side for extra  so the prices get jacked up  

It ends up being expensive  its mean and theres no reason for it in this day/age 

Also there was a period that Id try go there on Friday nights  EVERY table was reserved for the whole night   Like a private club  So Id go in for food  empty restaurant and be told I cant have food  Its a joke  they didnt even keep a single table free  I get that some parties sit all night  eating  drinking  but with 2/3 free tables you could get 12 covers in there; missing out on business at the same time 

Be less mean with portions  stop reserving every single table "
R0201,Great atmosphere for the evening  �Definitely an enjoyable time spent here  The bar was crowded  but the bartenders were attentive so it didnt take long to get served 
R0201, The pizza for both a yum the base was a crisp  Just as we like it 
R0201,"A well known Dublin experience  A must for tourists

The food is excellent  As is the service "
R0201,"as three American exchange students visiting Dublin  the sight of a milkshake bar who claimed to have ""the best milkshakes in the world"" warmed our hearts  We immediately went into the diner with high hopes  the jazzy 50s adding a certain jen a se qua to the the experience  After seeing the minimal option for milkshake sizes and flavor as  we put our faith in a chocolate shake  chocolate malt and Oreo shake  How could it go wrong  Milkshakes are literally ice cream and milk stirred up; how could this be any simpler  Our waitress was very curt and not interested in serving us  However  upon the arrival of our ""shakes"" we were in for a rude awakening  Best comparison you ask  A 15 year olds  poorly made  20  Kmart brand protein shake  Ingredients: 90 percent ICE  10 percent chocolate flavored powered  and some mystery malt chunks  Tastes identical to a prison cafeteria version of chocolate milk  Conclusion: dont trust the signs  you cant get the worlds best milkshake at 9pm on a Wednesday at an American 50s themed diner in Dublin "
R0201,Delicious food  very friendly staff and very reasonably priced  Great offer on mid week prosecco cocktails 
R0201,Delicious food  Very attentive service  will gladly go back
R0201,Eggs and avocado I got 2 poached eggs served with white mush and green mush and a mushy tomato  Tasteless  looked awful on the plate  I have no idea how this was let out of the kitchen as a meal   Euro 11:95 cost  With the amazing places to dine for breakfast in Dublin thankfully there is no need to return to this overpriced  bland  banal option  
R0201,Excellent venue and food  The only negative is that the childs portion of burger and chips was far too big 
R0201,Faring better was the pork dish we had that was served in lettuce leaves  but it needed more of a flavour punch to be memorable   when watery lettuce is the overriding taste in a dish  its not exactly a good thing  The highlight of the meal was the firecracker squid  it was seasoned and cooked really well and was the only dish that Id willingly have again   it was pretty delicious in fairness  We also had a really pushy server who kept at us to order more  which detracted greatly from the dining experience   cant see myself coming back here 
R0201,Food and athmosphere was good  Service was not great as not very engaging  When I asked if the eggs came with toast  I was told no so I ordered on the side  then to have a muffin on the eggs alreadY  also we had 2 kids with us and not accommodating on changing the orders
R0201,"Food hasnt impressed me  Staff is pretty good overall  Huge ornate place  but decor feels tired  Could be amazing  but as it stands its just ""ok""  "
R0201,Food order took almost 40 minutes before we got any food  We had Salmon  Chicken and pasta   While the meat was ok   the meals in itself were quite bland   Would not really plan to go back there for dinner 
R0201,Food quality very poor
R0201,Chicken wings advertised as buffalo which they aint  Service poor food was ditched on table go get your own cutlery and sauces etc
R0201,Food was awful  Order was wrong  twice  Food came out cold  we hardly ate it  We got a 20 percent reduction on our bill after we complained twice  Would definitely not recommend this restaurant 
R0201,"Food was great  All steaks were cooked perfectly
Great wine selection and knowledgeable and friendly staff who were very efficient"
R0201,"Food was meh  price was average  but staff were rude  The girl working on Saturday night could not have been less pleasant  Not a single positive thing to say about her  Brusque  literally rolling her eyes while I tried to put in my order and monosyllabic questions peppered with grunts and sighs  

"
R0201,Food was very disappointing  breakfast at home would be nicer  Very disappointed considering how difficult it was to get a table for a weekend brunch  Will not return after my experience 
R0201,Found the restaurant cold  Salad was small and uninspiring for price  Service was good 
R0201,Gave us wrong burgers  rediculously over salted fries  crap sound system  rubbish decor but staff quite friendly 
R0201,Great food / simple / tasty and great service  With a limited menu it makes for quick and tasty options 
R0201,Great Restaurant  Food delicious and value for money The service however is exemplary
R0201,Having recently enjoyed an evening meal here  very disappointing brunch with two friends  English muffin  served with salmon  and  poached eggs  wasnt toasted  �Latte not latte 
R0201,"I have eaten several time in the Mount Merrion branch and thoroughly enjoyed the experience  I decided to bring my family for dinner on Friday evening and was truly disappointed  The facility is large and was busy enough and yet there were only three waiting staff  My family all received their starters and were almost finished them by the time my starter came and that was only after we spent several minutes trying to get the attention of the waiting staff to inquire after my food  
Our mains arrived and the fires were hard and cold and my steak sandwich was cold  We tried to get the attention of the staff again but was almost impossible so we simply ate what we could  When it came to desserts we ordered the ice cream and chocolate sauce for our daughter and after some time she received a bowl with plain ice cream  we managed to get a staff member over to our table and we asked about the chocolate sauce and we were told they had run out  however no one said this when we ordered and no comment was made when it was presented  Having finally requested the bill we waited for someone to come to take payment and after sitting for another 15mins we got up put on our coats and then finally someone saw we wanted to pay  I would never go back to the Churchtown branch again and when friends at the weekend asked how we had enjoyed our meal and we told them of our experience they said they too had the same experience  Very disappointing "
R0201,"I invited a party of five
The decor is lovely  
Drinks were nice  coffees  teas and Bellinis  

However the food was a big let down  It was underwhelming and very disappointing  
It was served lacking any finesse and even the taste was lacking  I ordered the Caesar salad which to be honest was anything but a salad  I was offered chicken with my salad and received 1/2 a chicken  It was on the menu  I hadnt checked  but would never consider 1/2 a chicken to be appropriate to serve with a salad  I struggled to find the leaves  

Other items ordered were scones  as we were still hungry  but theyd run out and a pain au chocolate which turned out to be stale  It was 3 95 which is extortionate  

Will not be recommending or returning "
R0201,"Tom Yum Gai soup is usually good but the mains are hit and miss  as is the side orders 
Not recommended"
R0201,I thought this was pretty good in Dublin but these guys are another league  The base is a masterpiece  not rubbery or soggy at all  crunchy but not too dry or burnt 
R0201,I travel a lot alone so dining is a bit challenging  Went in here tonight early so I could have a seat at the bar for dinner  The bartender proceeded to make me feel like a huge nuisance  He got me a drink and then when I ordered he never looked up at me  I was only person at the bar  He never came over to ask if I needed anything else  would I like another drink  
R0201,I was very disappointed with my visit  We were a group of 4 adults and  on arrival  we were shown to a table at the back of the restaurant which was not at all pleasant as there was a family with a group of noisy children at the table next to us  Also  there was a loudspeaker right above us playing terrible music  we asked a few times for the music to be turned down lower  but it never was  Wed have much preferred to be seated in one of the booths on the way in  most of them looked vacant when we arrived but we thought they must have all been reserved as we werent allowed to take one  yet on our way out later most of them were still empty  When the food arrived it was disappointing  it was definitely a case of quantity rather than quality  which might suit some people but not us  For example  I had calamari as a starter and there was way too much of it  half of what was on the plate would have been enough as a starter  I then had a beef burger which came with what was described on the menu as a Handful of Fries   there was a huge load of fries on the plate but most of them were inedible  they were overcooked and tasted like theyd been reheated rather than freshly cooked  We had tea and coffee to finish and had to ask 3 times for some milk with the tea  Overall  it was overpriced for the quality of food and service  which was a real pity as the premises is lovely and its in a great location  but I wont be back 
R0201,Im really surprised that this place has gotten the reviews it has  because for what its charging the quality here is seriously sub par  While the staff is friendly and the atmosphere is nice  at the end of the day it is just a layer of masago there to keep you from realizing that theres not much quality content inside 
R0201,It used to be my favourite burger place in Dublin for years   fresh  high quality meat burgers from charcoal  For this we couldnt believe the bad quality burgers we were served on our last visit   the meat tasted like the worst kind you buy deep freeze in supermarket  Maybe we picked a wrong day  Wednesday  but we checked that more people complaint recently about bad quality burger meat and i dont see us coming back 
R0201,Its one star because I cant give it zero  
R0201,Menu lacked imagination  Prices too high for food provided  slow to clear tables  A complaint was to be related to the chef but that was  the last we heard   All told   although in our neighbourhood we will not be returning 
R0201,My son was sick all night after having fish  the quality of the food is poor
R0201,"OMG  this place is truly number  1 in Dublin
My advise to go with pouched eggs a along with avacadossss"
R0201,"Over priced and the food is hit or miss    at Euro 15 for breakfast you expect the eggs to be poached correctly  

Service could do with a little more training  as they all seem very inexperienced"
R0201,over priced especially for children  the food was very greasy  and  made us feel a bit unwell afterwards  service very slow  we had to ask for menus   an extra table setting etc
R0201,Perfect place for Sunday brunch with extended family
R0201,Poached eggs cold   Bacon burnt not crispy   Had invite my mother to brunch   new expierence for her  Not sure she will ever do brunch again
R0201,Poor food and service at expensive prices  although restaurant nicely decorated 
R0201,Poor quality food  and  greasy  Not good value for money  Disappointing 
R0201,Dude  I came in at 1:00PM  I walked out with my duck 3/4 unfinished  I can get understand the soggy skin or the overpowering star anise taste  but getting a cold duck is like serving overcooked and reheated pasta to an Italian 
R0201,Pretty bad food  The serving staff are really nice  The burger was way over cooked  We were told the burgers only come out well done because of local health laws  The duck salad had some shredded duck in it  but totally flavorless  Nice location but big prices for what you get  Will not be back here 
R0201,Quality and presentation of food is poor for the price they charge
R0201,Service was appalling       spoilt the whole occasion  One of the main courses  salmon  very poor value and over cooked  Never again 
R0201,"Service was very poor  Staff were uninterested  Once the initial order no follow up  I had to request a drink 3 times off 3 different waiters before I received it in which case my meal was nearly over 
Food is overpriced for the quality  Starters are ridiculous  
Ive been there 3 times now and the bad service was consistent and wont go back  There doesnt appear to be a senior or manager running things "
R0201,Service was very slow despite being quiet  this was not the first experience either 
R0201,"Such a shame that the owners after investing in the restaurant itself did not invest in training for the staff  

Catalog of issues which started before we sat down  
We were being brought towards the back of the restaurant past all the empty booths  We asked for one of them and initially were told they were reserved before they agreed to give us one  
We ordered our food including garlic bread for a starter for us all to share  It was impossible to taste even a hint of garlic when it arrived  We had also ordered stripped chicken for my daughter  As she was eating this she bit on a bone  At this point  we decided to complain  
The manager came to us and was very nice  He apologised and proceeded to get us another portion of garlic bread  This one came back and was inedible as it was dripping with Garlic  
From this point on  it went completely downhill  On numerous occasions waiting staff arrived at our table with dishes that were for other tables  
Our waitress didnt talk or look at us when she came to the table  Eventually the bill was almost thrown onto the table and after paying  we received a 10 percent discount  the waitress told us to have a good day without looking at us  
I completely blame the owners for not training the staff  We cant see ourselves returning there "
R0201,Superb breakfast and excellent service  Would highly recommend and will be returning again for sure 
R0201,Table was booked for 8 15pm didnt get it  til nearly 9pm  We were left standing at the bar nobody asked us if we wanted a drink  There was one bar man rushed off his feet trying to do the orders for all of the tables  We got a free round of drinks only when one of our guests suggested this due to the very long wait  Food was nice but terrible service not enough staff
R0201,Terrible food  dirty toilets  restaurant was cold 
R0201,The ambiance and decor is lovely and staff are very friendly  but the food can do with some improvement  French toast was not cooked properly  the rosemary fries barely have the taste of rosemary and the chicken wings are the worst I have ever tasted; dissapointed on that aspect as it is pretty difficult to make a balls of chicken wings  I think the chefs need to taste the food they are dishing out before plating up or they need to taste what their competitors are offering alike  Small changes to attention to detail  could really make a big culinary difference to a lack lustre eating experience  It is a shame how difficult it is to get a showing stopping brunch experience in Dublin 
R0201,"The healthy version right in the city   And the best place to meet friends  
The kinder Bueno sauce is best thing in this place    I would love if they would mix the toppings and yoghurt together rather than pile everything on top "
R0201,The menu during the day is very limited  We were there on a Sunday and the only main courses on offer were burgers or a salad  While the burger was very tasty  it would be nice to have a bit more choice 
R0201,"The place was empty pretty much up until we left at 10pm   Food is distinctly average but staff very pleasant  so on that basis theyll redeem themselves   Would say they need to raise their game on the food presentation front  as we all had burgers  with the fries just scattered beside them on the plate with no real thought given  
Do the simple things well  is what Id say here guys   "
R0201,The restaurant is nicely decorated and fitted out to high quality but then let down by the staff  The manager is great from talking to you and holding the door for people to come in and out  unfortunately the bar and waiting staff need help to achieve the job from making a good cocktail to serving the correct person food  If theres an investment in this area the place has potential to be great 
R0201,The service was pretty awful  Staff were nice but we had to ask every time we needed anything  They left us for 30 mins waiting for dessert menus  We waited about an hour for the bill and then again for the card reader then again for change  I spent most of the night trying to catch the waitresses attention rather than being able to engage in conversations at the table 
R0201,There is lots of space for buggies which is great but the food was a little disappointing with some of the breakfast cold and the pancakes small
R0201,"There were 7 of us dining and again the pizza oven was not working    This has happen on a couple of occasions we have have been with you and my kids in particular are very disappointed  
The food on Sunday evening was average  poorly presented and not very tasty 
The chicken was over cooked and the chips were throw on the plate  
A suggestion to make it a little more appetizing would be chips in a bowl or container and the burger or whatever main  could be accompanied with a small side salad  
I hope you can take this in to consideration as we live locally and would love to be able to enjoy going to meals there in the future "
R0201,"This has been my 4th time in this restaurant and unfortunately it is going to be my last  Despite my efforts to really like this place  its just not up to par 
The service is ok but the food unfortunately is no even close to ok 
On my last visit  we had the kids pasta which was completely overcooked 
2 Bacon and egg  one with scrambled and one with poached eggs  The scrambled eggs were overdone and the potatoes on one of the dishes were underdone  The bacon was rock hard and the coffee I ordered was watery  I did receive a replacement coffee which I wasnt charged for 
The service is good and its a crying shame the food isnt  as Churchtown really could do with a restaurant that serves decent brunch and dinner "
R0201,Grease soaked naan bread  They should give everyone a refund and a cholesterol test 
R0201,"This has got to be my worst experience Ever      I dont blame the staff   I blame the management for the lack of staff training and no system or processes in place  I book my table at 11 30  I got my table at 12     although there where loads of free tables     we didnt get our food till 12 30  Shocking  In fairness the young manager was doing his best   and we got the food for free   which I didnt want but he insisted on the promise I would come back    I did leave a tip because I didnt want the staff or the young manager to pay for that out of there own pocket  

NOTE TO THE OWNERS   PLEASE   PLEASE   PLEASE INVESTN THE TRAINING OF YOUR STAFF "
R0201,This is my second time here and both times waiting over an hour for food  This time it was not even busy  Very overpriced for what it is
R0201,"Tourist trap location but beware of HIDDEN CHARGES 
The restaurant advertises access to the buffet for 16 euros per person 
We have been charged twice that amount for changing to a clean plate 
Funny this is not all of us did  but the restaurant decided to charge double the amount for everybody  Unprofessional and dishonest tactics  targeted mostly at unsuspecting tourists "
R0201,Visited here in Dec with a group of 6  Cant understand how this place has the reviews its has this is far for the best Italian in Dublin  The Minestrone soup was bland no flavour  Two of our group had Steaks  Ribeye  and  Striploin never arrived 
R0201,Waited 30 mins for breakfast  Seems to depend on who you are as to how quickly you get served in this place 
R0201,We arrived on time for 1 30pm  We were told to wait at the bar  We were seated about 20 mins later  After waiting another 15 mins to order we did and the started came out 10 mins later but our main meal took forever to arrive  It was after 2 30pm before we got them  Ridiculous waiting time  Such poor service  They need more staff  Wont be in a rush to return 
R0201,We had a nice family super here mid week  Food was lovely but the service was slow  We waited a very long time between starter and main  The food then didnt all arrive together and my husband waited for his pizza  When the restaurant was very quiet it was disappointing  A quick family supper turned quite lengthy which was hard for small children 
R0201,"We had the southern fried chicken burger and both were bland  We usually go for this as they are amazing  It is a bank holiday and it was busier than normal  perhaps the kitchen was under pressure   
The milk chocolate delise was scrumptious and so were our coffees "
R0201,We had to wait almost an hour for our food  I was with my 3 year old son  They were very apologetic and took some items off the billl  which was appreciated  but we shouldnt have had to wait so long  If the staff actually checked if people had their food this could have been avoided  I have been 5 times and each time has been a disappointment  I cant see myself going back unless they seriously improve their service 
R0201,We really liked the fact that the place is lovely and spacious so we were eager to try it out  We were however extremely disappointed with the food  In particular as I mentioned to the waiter the sausages that I had seemed to have been reheated   to be honest they were horrible  I rarely complain about food I receive but on this occasion I felt I had to   I also thought we might have received some kind of discount given that I informed the waiter I was unhappy but this didnt happen 
R0201,We were a bit late  10 mins but Id rang ahead to let them know  Still sent to bar to wait along with other diners  Not sure if thats policy   Anyway  starter came out fine but approx 40 mins wait for mains   2 burgers    The presentation was terrible and most unseasoned burger Ive ever had  It was my husbands birthday but tbh we didnt hang around for desert  White Wine was warm too    overall a big let down  Sorry wont be back 
R0201,Well being from the US i expected the tomahawk to be like Mastros or better     it wasnt    not even close  Half of it was over cooked and there other half was undercooked  We asked for medium rare     had to send the second half back to be cooked more and then it came back tasting like oil  � �We didnt complain  ate it and left     too much hype  Nice place but under delivered 
R0201,"Work close by and a group called in for lunch  slow service  staff not as attentive as it could be 
Food was okay  colleagues salad not as described on menu  
Would not return for lunch or if under time pressure "
R0201,Worst food Ive ever had  And worst service  Absolutely disgraceful
R0202,Beautiful setting and very good service  but the food needs work   Starters were very good but all mains were far too salty   and one inedible as a result  Early days for this restaurant so hope the kitchen reaches the standard of front of house in due course 
R0202,Delicious food  excellent wine  relaxed atmosphere and attentive friendly staff  Definitely recommend 
R0202,Didnt  enjoy experience  was down for Birthday with husband found the noise  unbearable ask to be moved but no joy would def not come back
R0202,Downstairs was amazing
R0202,Expensive for what we had but very tasty  Beautiful location
R0202,Fabulous food  taste sensations and one of if not the best Wine List in Dublin  A must must go please 
R0202,Far exceeded my expectations  Asked for a quite table on the booking as lunch was a business meeting  Thank you for helping the meeting go great 
R0202,Food average only  Service was very good  Reasonable place for a pre show bite 
R0202,Food was tast  overpriced and mean  Scallops for  Euro 13 was actually a single scallop  When they brought the starters we were looking for the rest of the dish to arrive   Euro 27 lamb doesnt include potatoes or vegetables   The food was well cooked  and tasty but too little of it  far too expensive and too many hidden extras  Dinner for four was over  Euro 300 but we were still charged  Euro 3 50 for bread  The staff were efficient and officious   no smiling  no personality or banter  Every question was answered with a poker face and we felt rushed to order  To be fair  we shared our feedback about the price and portions at the time and were offered a round of drinks which was appreciated   We wont be back  If they keep taking advantage of their customers no one else will either  It was pretty quiet even though it was Saturday on a bank holiday 
R0202,Great service and range of craft beers  Food is good too  Nice ambience with loads of space 
R0202,"I didnt enjoy my meal here  I felt it was overpriced  greasy  and of poor quality 
It took 30 minutes to get food at 8 pm on a Saturday 
I was not happy with the service or food  I told customers coming in not to bother  thats how much I disliked it    And I dont really dislike much 
Many more options in the area 
Avoid this one "
R0202,I feel the setting sold us on booking however the food was average  cocktails below average and service not great 
R0202,"I found the food here to be absolutely horrendous  

I got the half chicken  It was clearly a dwarf chicken who had no wings  Some sort of abomination  It was smothered in a BBQ that was sickeningly sweet  Tiny portion  see photo   no wing for some reason and BBQ sauce that was really terrible  Just sugar  no flavour 

My 2 sides were the corn on the cob which was over done  I am presuming it was probably sitting there for a while  I ate a couple bites of it and left the rest  Disgusting  I also got coleslaw which was AOK 

The girl serving us was very friendly  Cant fault that  But I am here for the food  not the service  

Was this an off day  I just dont understand how they can f*ck this up so much  I felt like I was eating at an overpriced airport restaurant "
R0202,"I have been many times 
And has never disappointed 
Top breakfast make sure you go     
Its grand  "
R0202,I know its a busy time of year  but we were there for a work lunch and were waiting 45 minutes for our order 
R0202,I ordered the beef cheek ravioli special for  Euro 16 for lunch  I received 5 ravioli which is absolutely insane for the price  It was more like a starter 
R0202,Lovely food and I love the vaults  Service was good
R0202,Lovely little place with a lot of character  Went for brunch   simple fare  done very well 
R0202,Probably the worst place Ive ever been since Im in Ireland 
R0202,"Read about this place on here and decided to try it 
Cracking breakfast great service and very happy staff  Really good value"
R0202,Really disappointing  Food was tasteless and staff mixed up our orders  Such a disappointing night  Will never come back 
R0202,Really good coffee and soup  the staff is always smiling and friendly  definitely one of my favourites place to get a coffee
R0202,Really like it here  Just outside the city centre its all let place to get away from the city centre and grab a bite to eat 
R0202,It was a very disappointing experience  especially since they were ranked within the top 10 locations for the dish in Dublin  There are a few different kinds of fish to choose from  You must purchase sauces separately  although there are several options  and the portions are large   I found the fish to be somewhat tasteless and greasy 
R0202,Such a fantastic nigh  I loved the food  ambiance and atmosphere  Well be back  
R0202,Such delicious soup here  excellent niche in the market for it  Fresh and warming  I want you at home    
R0202,The food was ok   the steak was below average  A very thin cut and obviously dry as a result
R0202,The menu was limited and didnt represent value for money  There was no flexibility to ask for the ala cart menu  The early bird was very limited particularly the starters  Although the beef that I had was good it was fairly sparse in volume 
R0202,This was my first visit   and  I was so pleasently surprised  I han no idea such a great restaurant  Great food  and  service 
R0202,"Unbelievably quiet on a Saturday night   should have been a warning sign   The food was pretentious and overpriced for the quality and amount of food   The staff were inexperienced and it seemed as if it were the waitresss first time taking an order   

The food food was decent  but extremely overpriced  especially considering how tiny the portions were    I couldnt believe my duck entree was a duck breast the size of my index and middle fingers   The space of the restaurant was lovely   

Id go back there for drinks  but would absolutely not return for food   At the price point of 25 euro an entree  the food should be superb   They failed to meet the mark "
R0202,Very cool venue with awesome menu options  Service was great as well 
R0202,"Very disorganised 
Poor service 
Food forgotten about
Food poor"
R0202,"Very loud at times  difficult to hear 
Took a long time for the food to arrive 
As non drinkers  very poor selection of deserts "
R0202,Visiting from another country   means relying heavily on websites and reviews   The location description address had us in circles  Maybe give a reference point on the site  ex: next to the name of a big building or located in a plaza   The website does indicate two different places for the site  but we didnt understand that until we got there  We had reservations for the basement  but they were for outside location  The staff didnt bend on helping us get a table even with reservations  They were more considered with serving the locals upstairs  The food on the menu was okay  but overall this place seemed overrated  Ended up going to a place we thoroughly enjoyed 
R0202,We ate here during our most recent trip and the food was delicious and the staff was very helpful and super friendly   The breakfast was top notch 
R0202,We were very disappointed with our recent lunch order  We ordered two burgers which were served rare  from a food safety perspective all minced meat products ie burgers should be thoroughly cooked  this was not the case  and  is a danger to human health  Unfortunately not cooking burgers thoroughly puts you at risk of Ingesting bacteria like E  coil or enterococcus  This could be fatal   
R0203,All in all this was a wonderful experience in a wonderful restaurant that I can see myself returning to for quiet intimate drinks as well as big group celebration 
R0203,Delicious meal for Saturday brunch  nice setting in bright atrium bar and great service 
R0203,Excellent Service and fabulous food   Tapas were tasty and great way to spend evening with friends   The vaulted stone basement building is stunning 
R0203,Excellent service and food  I really enjoyed the ambiance in the light filled bar  Definitely want to go back to see the vaults 
R0203,Fantastic staff and ambiance  especially on the lower level 
R0203,Food is great  have been there twice before but the service was a real let down  Found the staff to be pushy and rude 
R0203,Great spot for a business meal  Food and drinks both outstanding 
R0203,Ive got the wings a few times  each time Ive been very disappointed
R0203,It was a very busy night in the restaurant and it was clear they didnt have enough staff to attend the demand  The receptionist brought us to the table without menus  We were waiting there for around 10 15 min wondering if we should order at the bar  We went to ask and the waitress recommended us to go back to the reception  We said we just wanted to see the menus and she said someone else would talk to us on the table  Few minutes later another waitress gave us menus  Others 10 min later the same waitress got back to us saying she could not take our order for another 10 min because the kitchen was too busy  The place was too warm and at the moment we just wanted to be able to order a drink  what we did  When the food finally arrived it was very good  however our overall experience wasnt great 
R0203,Its a delightful place to dine  � Wonderful service and superb dishes that are delightfully balanced with flavor  � You will enjoy 
R0203,Really delicious food and unreal setting with the vaults  The staff were super friendly and helpful too  Cant wait to come back again 
R0203,"Service was slow unfortunately both times I visited  Each time I visited  it wasnt too busy so unfortunately it cant be blamed on that  I asked for condiments twice that werent delivered  

A pity because this place has all the right ingredients to be a hit  Hopefully  service improves "
R0203,Surprisingly fabulous food   cant wait to go back  Great atmosphere and good service too 
R0203,The place is lovely  Great food  great drinks  great drinks  It was just a bit cold inside 
R0203,The serving sizes are unquestionably too small  Could do with better dessert/ice cream selection
R0203,"We ordered the chefs eggs Benedict and it was rank  Hollandis sauce was dripping from the plate  the rashers were cold  the muffin was soggy and the eggs were just there  The latte tasted bad  we couldnt leave there fast enough  
I know this is a pretty strong negative review but its exactly what we experienced "
R0203,This place is excellent all round  the food  ambiance  cocktails and overall atmosphere  The outdoor smoking area is warm and cozy  we had a fab night 
R0203,"This restaurant has the potential to be fantastic  The location is great  the staff are friendly  the interior is lovely and the food was delicious  The 1/2 chicken  calamari and sweet potatoes from the tapas menu were the highlights 

It was completely let down by the service  The waitress who took our order wrote nothing down and we had to ask repeatedly for dishes that were missing  After waiting almost an hour for prawns  they came out overcooked  The same waitress tried to say that they had been on the initial order when clearly they hadnt  I think customers would be a lot more forgiving of an honest mistake and apology than an excuse that insults their intelligence 

When we tried to pay  the card machine would not accept any of our cards and it took over 20mins to pay the bill 

I couldnt recommend the restaurant  purely because the service was so bad  I would be very embarrassed if I sent people in and they had that same experience "
R0203,Vault underground was a very nice setting but the noise level was very high  even with the rooms fairly empty  Food was average  Service was understaffed so slow  There are no bus boys to remove plates 
R0203,We booked upstairs and upon arrival were told there was no space for us and were brought downstairs where there was a really noisy party on  We had to leave and try and find somewhere else to accommodate us 
R0203,We had a lovely evening  staff were lovely and the food and drinks were amazing 
R0203,We have been here several times and they are always out of several of their own beers  There are plenty of beers to choose from on their list but why have brewing in your name if you never have the beers
R0203,"We shared the appetizers platter which was ok consisted of : spring rolls
Prawn cakes
Ribs
Chicken satay
Unfortunately I wont come again for the food "
R0203,Went here with my husband on a date   The beer menu is extensive  the food is delicious and the staff were very attentive   I would definitely go back again 
R0203,"Went there for tapas  it was busy but still limited service at table level;

Waiting 10 mins for a drink order 
Food is small for what you get  ironically tapas I know  
   Euro 14 for monkfish and its small small for example

Waited 10 mins after been asked if we want desert and no one came back so we left
None of the table cleared beside us 

Just poor poor service"
R0204,Great food  great style  great atmosphere  Will 100 percent  back for brunch  and  lunch 
R0205,Amazing place  Romantic and very cozy  Super Good service  If you want to surprise someone you must go here 
R0205,Fabulous cocktail bar   Different from every other one in Dublin
R0205,Love this place  Second time visiting on trips to Dublin  Great experience  Fab staff  Amazing cocktails 
R0205,Lovely wee club very chilled and cocktails to die for need to get back to try more  Book a table so your not disappointed 
R0205,"Nice place  good cocktails  good food
Very good ambiance  Surely a wonderful option for a bar in the city of pubs"
R0205,Quality time with the couple
R0205,Very cool speakeasy  We loved the atmosphere and the awesome cocktails 
R0205, Food was great and not over priced

Fantastic Cocktails the best in Dublin City  staff professional/helpful  and very enthusiastic about there work 

Highly recommend"
R0205,"A beautifully hidden oasis of calm in the centre of  the live music and craic

R0205,A bit tasteless food  but a warm ond cool place to go
R0205,A hidden gem  amazing staff and all round good vibes
R0205,"A little hidden gem   wonderful cocktails  cosy
Staff very knowledgeable and helpful"
R0205,A really great night out with fabulous cocktails served as always with a big smile 
R0205,A wonderful cocktail list coupled with a fun speakeasy experience 
R0205,Absolutely fabulous place  had food  and  cocktails both were amazing   Ann Marie our waitress was so helpful  and  friendly
R0205,Absolutely fantastic  great find and will definitely be back again 
R0205,Absolutely fantastic  Gorgeous place  wild food  beautiful cocktails 
R0205,Absolutely the best drink and cocktail bar I ever experienced
R0205,After booking in advanced we where disappointed  to be place right beside the kitchen window and entrance  It was very bright and busy with people in and out  We asked to moved as the place was mostly empty  However they stated that the other tables are booked in advance and if they dont turn up you could have those tables  Which I couldnt understand as we had booked in advanced and arrived on time  In the end we did get moved but it just tainted the night for us 
R0205,"After several times of being rejected without a reservation  i was extremely disappointed with my visit to it  The service was appalling  waiting outside the door without it being opened for almost 15 minutes when coming to your booked time reservation  The cocktails took 20 minutes at least  food menu was not served until over 1 hour at the table  and this is after someone called to ensure we will be there for the reservation    food and drinks   i would have expected the menu on the table at that stage   
Food was terrible  and cocktails below average  Would not be coming back and will not recommend to anyone "
R0205,Although we didnt try the food the drink menu is great  Loved the ambiance  Its a special place
R0205,Always an amazing experience   Great drinks and the food was amazing  Will be back again soon 
R0205,Always very elegant and beautiful atmosphere  Also  the staff are very knowledgeable and accommodating 
R0205,Amazeballs

R0205,Amazing cocktails
R0205,Amazing experience and delicious food and cocktails 
R0205,Amazing experience in this hidden gem  Brunch was amazing as were the cocktails and all at a reasonable price  We went fairly early in the day and had the floor to ourselves before it got busy which was good  Staff very friendly and helpful  would highly recommend and will return 
R0205,Amazing experience  went for a birthday treat  Finger food was very hot on arrival and presented well  Hostess was very knowledgeable about all the cocktails  Atmosphere was warm and cosy  Decor was outstanded  would highly recommend  Totally enjoyable birthday 
R0205,Amazing food  wonderful service and the best cocktails Ive tasted  
R0205,Amazing night      quirky in a good way  speakeasy atmosphere  Cocktails unbelievable and the staff could not do enough  All in all an excellent night
R0205,Amazing place of tranquil in the heart of   Love the atmosphere and experience the place offers

R0205,Amazing staff very chatty and great to recommend  A special thanks to the dark haired lady with a northern twang she made the night fantastic 
R0205,Ambience great  Food literally tasted like heaven
R0205,Ambience great 
R0205,An absolutely amazing night  Incredible service and even more incredible cocktails  An amazing find    if you can find it 
R0205,As always this place never ceases to amaze with its amazing food and its cocktails
R0205,Awesome private little bar  Top of the line cocktails with killer Duck Confit
R0205,Bad experience
R0205,Beautiful ambiance but very slow service  Seems very short staffed  Will still visit again
R0205,Booked here for my sisters birthday as I had been in February and really like it   This visit I was as very disappointed as the food was not up the standards that was in February  2 of our meals had to go back as they were cold   The other meals were just ok and for the price we paid I expected more than just ok  
R0205,"Booked for a special occasion  was waiting about 30 minutes for our first drinks order and about the same time to place a second order  the bar was not overly busy for a Friday night but service was so slow we ended up having just 2 drinks over our whole sitting 
For the prices being charged  the standard is no way up to scratch  style over substance 
I sent an email the next day and have yet to hear back from anyone other than a confirmation it was received 12 days later  A follow up email has also been ignored "
R0205,"For the prices being charged  the standard is no way up to scratch  style over substance 
I sent an email the next day and have yet to hear back from anyone other than a confirmation it was received 12 days later  A follow up email has also been ignored "
R0205,Both my fiance and I went for the first time and had a few drinks  The service was great as were the cocktails and general ambience  Highly recommended place to visit  Will be returning to sample the food menu 
R0205,Brought my girlfriend for her birthday we had a fantastic experience  The atmosphere was unreal and the cocktails are worth every single cent  Excellent of youre looking to do something different  Its special from start to finish  Thanks for a great night  Highly recommend 
R0205,Brought my mom or her 72nd birthday  She used to have carpet in her house  Loved it  Fab cocktails too
R0205,Burger was dry and tasteless
R0205,Cocktails are great  nice ambience  Food was not good  Steak was tough and bland very expensive and not worth the money
R0205,"Cocktails good but cocktail menu too long  Food ok but vegetable tempura was fried in too cold an oil so was unnecessarily limp and soggy  We asked for a wine list but it did not materialise   Service was irregular and food and drink delivery was slow Make sure you tell them when you book that you want to eat as the tables are really small and geared for drinking  Even having water and cocktails made the table too crowded  
Patricia"
R0205,Cocktails were great  Service was not   left standing on the stairs for quite awhile when we arrived on time for our table   then found the room empty and tables waiting when we finally got into the room  Waitress was very knowledgeable  but not friendly and had too many tables to cover so hard to get her attention  Food was very disappointing   we didnt even eat it and I was sick when I got home  Menu still on the app is not up to date and the current menu available is less enticing  This was my third   and last   visit; the other 2 occasions were good but the place has gone way down 
R0205,Cocktails were amazing and staff were friends  Will definitely be returning
R0205,Crap I wish I could stop right �here but Im forced to write more we had a 3course we new from the starter it was gona go downhill  food crap staff crap food yak save ur time and money
R0205,"Difficult to find but thats the part of the charm of dinning at that place   Lovely cocktails and food and ambience   
Will go back  "
R0205,Disappointing experience  �Positioning of place  finer casual dining  rotating local menu  etc   is inconsistent with execution   �Not a bad thing but once again inconsistent with brand positioning  �Service is a mess  about an hour to get food after being seated 20 minutes after we were told a table would be available  �Food is good but not blow you away  �I would pass on this place 
R0205,Dishes were dirty and even chipped  If your going to come here  come here just for the coffee 
R0205,Do NOT go here  Horrible experience
R0205,Our table was DIRECTLY next to the kitchen door for the waitstaff and while the rest of the place was dimly lit and beautiful  our table was brightly illuminated by HORRIBLE bright white kitchen lightening whenever the door was opened by the staff  approx every 2 mins   We very nicely asked to be moved to a different table   and  also reminded them that we asked for a more private table when booking etc   and  the front staff manager was beyond rude telling us there was no where we could move  at least 20+ open tables on our floor alone   and  then proceeded to imply we were lying about asking for a more private table  and  trying to force us to take the bad table at / basically inside the kitchen  after arguing with her for a few minutes we decided these  Euro 15 cocktails sitting basically inside the kitchen wasnt worth it  and  we got up to leave  Thats when another manager tried to get us to stay by basically saying the other woman wasnt telling the truth and we could in fact move  but the damage was done after 10 mins of arguing and being called a liar   and  we left  So much for a really fun night out  The staff there are horrible 
R0205,Enjoyed a lovely evening   Food was great and the recommended cocktails were wonderful   Definitely recommend 
R0205,Everything there is amazing  Employees were adorable and this place is outstanding  A good moment with low music and good cocktails 
R0205,Excellent and intimate  Great as always  The waitress was well able to advise in all cocktails 
R0205,Excellent experience
R0205,Excellent place to go for a drink
R0205,Excellent service with a smile  fine dining with suburb quality food  Fine wines to wash down an excellent meal
R0205,Excellent time had in here as always  Its an easy pace and a quiet spot  Just perfect to escape the bustle right outside the door 
R0205,Excellent waitress  delicious food and tasty cocktails perfect
R0205,"Fabulous and very welcoming

Would not be in a hurry to return  despite lovely staff "
R0205,Would not be in a hurry to return  despite lovely staff  Sad
R0205,Following our review of this place we have not heard from a manager we have not had an apology from the staff member in question but I did have his wife TRACE ME DOWN ON FACEBOOK yet nothing has changed so we will not be coming back to this place again 
R0205,"Food was average  Blank  
We ordered a tasting menu  the waiting time in between the courses was too long  service wasnt as snappy as it should be for a Michelin star restaurant  "
R0205,Food was nice but nothing special  For the price we paid isnt value for money 
R0205,Food was nice but nothing special  Cocktails were way over priced and the cocktail list was taken away as soon as we ordered so no chance to browse for next one  Expected some sort of entertainment but there was nothing  For the price we paid isnt value for money 
R0205,Going to Dublin  Visiting this place is a must  world class cocktails in a unique one of kind building  See AnnMarie  she will look after you like no other 
R0205,Good Cocktails and Service  Gem of a Beer erm Cocktail Garden  
R0205,Gorgeous food and the staff are so nice and helpful
R0205,Gorgeous  Would definitely come back  Wish there was one in Belfast
R0205,"Great ambience and venue  great cocktails  however I ordered my steak ""medium  well  more well than medium"" it arrived very much more medium than well
I was very  very hungry and began to eat by hiding the blood with the potatoe  I was finished before the waitress checked ""is everything ok ""
Disappointing   "

R0205,Great staff lovely atmosphere amazing cocktails great pre theatre start to the evening will be back 
R0205,Had a lovely evening      food great     cocktails delicious      serves excellent      thank you
R0205,Had a lovely few hours drinking cocktails with friends  I would highly recommend this venue 
R0205,Have been a few times  great cocktails and food is good too
R0205,Having booked a table two weeks in advance  we were told both via email and phone that we mustnt be late  We turned up at 4 55 for a 5pm table  only to be sat upstairs in the outdoor area and forgotten about til 5 20pm  without any offer of a drink or any communication during the wait  We were ignored until we finally had to approach the waitress to remind her we were there  Once we were sat  the waitress who served us  different person to previously mentioned  was attentive and friendly  cocktails were fabulous and the atmosphere was cosy and relaxed  Shame about the shocking service at the start 
R0205,"Heard good things  overall disappointed  Seating area on the rooftop section I had to sit on a puff with no back support  outrageous carry on not having decent seating  

Cocktail Menu was poor and confusing  and to boot the staff kept taking the menus back off our table which I later found out was due to guests robbing them  Staff were not attentive and were not observant when drinks were low  

For a Better experience  attentiveness from staff and ambience Peruke  and  Periwig is streets ahead  Save your cash for that establishment "
R0205,"Hi 

Very nice place to have a drink in regards to setting and atmosphere  however  the service was poor  Took over 25 mins to receive our drinks and people who ordered after us received theres before us  

I reckon this was down to a mistake made by one of the staff but this was never communicated with us and in the end I had to go and ask one of the staff  

There was also a delay coming back to the table to take the bill and again I had to approach the counter myself to pay

Drinks were good but poor experience over all "
R0205,"I booked to have an evening of cocktails with my partner for his birthday  I was recommended by a friend who has visited before and all I can say is I would 100 percent come again  The service was amazing to the point the lady made a cocktail she thought we may like and my partner didnt so she changed it with no fuss  We were offered our original seat inside but as the weather was so lovely she seated us outside in the upstairs part which was partly covered and we stayed there all evening  We ordered some snacks to have with our cocktails and they were delicious  

Highly recommend  5*"
R0205,No please  no thank you  no sorry for the wait and again no on the house cocktails like the older couple  The place was quite funky and cool  the cocktails were amazing but i wont be back due to this shocking service and unfair treatment  Theres more reasonable priced cocktails elsewere in dublin in establishements that would be more than happy to have your custom  An explanation as to why out of 3 couples who sat waiting only one  the older couple  got offered some form of compensation 
R0205,I brought my girlfriend here for an evening for her birthday as its somewhere she has always wanted to visit  On arrival we were seated in a small corner beside 2 other couples  Menus were brought out  all 3 couples sat for 25minutes without a server coming over and taking an order  When the server eventually did come over there was no apology for the wait  So we placed the order along with the other two couples because what the heck  we wanted to try them out  To be fair when they eventually came they were very good cocktails  Thoroughly enjoyed them so we decided we would stay for another  but the other two couples were not so impressed  The older of the two couples were met at the door on their way out and were offered to have their cocktails on the house because of the wait which i thought well ok  at least they know the wait was bad  The younger of the two couples however who waited longer than the other two did not get their cocktails on the house  We decided to stay for one more anyway but 20minutes later and noone had came back to take another order  The servers walked by us several times and i tried to get their attention but no avail  So we decided enough was enough we would leave  I went to the bar to pay and our server just walked by and said  Euro 23 90 and walked on  
R0205,I enjoyed the ambience  and  setting  and  the cocktail I ordered was very tasty  However I cannot understand why there are no prices in the cocktail menu  My biggest gripe was the food  We ordered a meat  and  cheese sharing platter for 2 people for  Euro 22 and got 2 teeny chunks of cheese  1 each   The meats were straight out of a packet  the slices not even separated   it was so disappointing and bland    I would not recommend the food
R0205,"I love the broad selection of cocktails old  new  everythi�g 
And its great to be able to talk  no loud music  no tv screen  Great ambience"
R0205,I was looking for a rooftop bar and found this place on web  I received a phone call half an hour before my booking to ask if I still wanted to be in the rooftop bar as this was the smoking area  We changed to a table inside  Inside was very dark I could hardly see the cocktail menu so we ended up going to the rooftop which could do with a refubishment  The cocktail menu is extensive  the cocktail received was more ice than liquid 11 95 euros  we went to wine  house wine was 6 60 per glass  The food was enjoyable and fresh  When I arrived home I noticed on the bill that we had been charged 2 80 for a small spark  We did not order sparkling water  we were given tap water on arrival  which tasted of chlorine    Overall I would give it 3 stars out of 5 purely down to the food 
R0205,I was not told our seating would be in the smoking area when I made the booking 
R0205,I was there for my sisters hen party drinks  The booking was mixed up due to a system error and we moved table from a table for 4 to a taber for 2  The water glasses were chipped and the floor staff  and bartender seemed very stressed  The cocktails werent as good as the last time either  Still a quite pleasant athmoshere  Hopefully it will be better next time 
R0205,"Ive been before  and really enjoyed it  but things have taken a bit of a turn for the worst  

I feel its gone from exclusive escape to tourist attraction  

Which is a shame  

Its lost the sense of exclusivity and every hotel and restaurant seems to be promoting it  

The cocktails where also a lot less tasty than I remember "
R0205,Immaculate cocktails and extremely good service  My first time there  but surely not the last one as both my girlfriend and I enjoyed our evening 
R0205,Interesting place  but I think its better in the evening for a cocktail than during brunch time 
R0205,Staff is cold and disrespectful
R0205,It s a great place but please turn on the radiator the next time it was totally freezing   so food got cold and we just wanted to leave quickly  Pity 
R0205,It was a great place in the past  but honestly we would never  ever return
R0205,It was a great place in the past  but honestly we would never  ever return  Disappointed
R0205,It was absolutely freezing here I would hestitate to return and to recommend to friends 
R0205,Customers arrived and left without ordering anything  We were eventually moved to beside the fire but it was such an uncomfortable experience  I would hestitate to return and to recommend to friends 
R0205,It was lovely but I wish we would have been told that we only have 2 hours  It wasnt mentioned in the booking nor in the confirmation call I received 3 hours before  the booking
R0205,"It was my birthday  and  I mentioned on the phone that Id never been before  It was a once off  They advised I sit in the ""rooftop terrace""   it was esentially a smoking area  with no view  I wasnt impressed to be totally honest  the drinks were v good but the ambience was so so for such an occassion  Indoors looked nice  I dont understand them putting people who had never been  who are celebrating a special occassion   in the dingiest part  I wont be back "
R0205,It was really cold in the restaurant  We still enjoyed our evening but had to put our jackets back on 
R0205,Its a great place and the food and cocktails are good  The only thing is the service  it was very slow  The tables are small and they were trying to put food on table before clearing it  They were very anxious to clear table for next sitting  Just felt the service could be better
R0205,Lacking and a bit boring  No ambiance and over priced  Bar tender lacked karizma also
R0205,Just perfect and staff could not have been more attentive  Cocktails and food were great  Highly recommend 
R0205,Just terrific   the whole crew really knows their way around a cocktail  Great food  beautiful comfortable space   will talk about it for ages 
R0205,Local flavor  get your meat and eggs  friendly staff   The menu doesnt have a lot of options  You can get the eggs with beans  omelette a  toastz
R0205,Love the place; Food  Drinks and Service was great and the atmosphere is lovely  Will definitely be back
R0205,Love this place  Cant wait to go back  Cocktails as usual were fantastic 
R0205,Loved the food and atmosphere overall loved my first time and will definitely be back 
R0205,"Loved the food  the chef was on point 
Drinks were good and the staff were able to recommend good choices "
R0205,Lovely ambiance and service was reasonable  although appeared to be one bar person on so a little slow for cocktail orders   Food was not great   had pork belly as a starter which was a huge portion and could be smaller for a starter  Had chicken for main which was ok  I would return again but just for drinks 
R0205,Lovely ambiance  amazing cocktails and delicious food  A little pricey  but worth every penny  Me and my partner would definitely go again 
R0205,Lovely staff  amazing drinks  and a great place to meet other travelers 
R0205,My fave go to place with friends  especially overseas visitors  Incredible staff  fab drinks and food  The setting is second to none  Love it 
R0205,My husband and I absolutely LOVED our time here  Absolutely amazing drinks  great service  wonderful atmosphere  Highly recommend  
R0205,We didnt eat in the end as the table was so small and right on top of other people I think I may have elbowed the person next to me trying to eat a steak  We had one drink and left  we were very disappointed
R0205,Myself and my boyfriend booked a table for dinner and cocktails and we stuck at a tiny table by the door  which kept being left open so we were freezing  
R0205,Never been anywhere like it  We had a blast and loved everything we tried 
R0205,Nice food and good cocktails but terrible service  No waiters to be seen for over half an hour at some stage and then so slow to bring the drinks 
R0205,Nice place  although lamp lights would be better as hard to read ingredients of the cocktails due to small font and candles flickering so much   Very cold inside due to strong cold draft coming down open stairwell from upper level   Had to ask for blankets   Waitress kindly moved us to small fireplace when a table of customers had left but this still meant one person at our table remained cold  Staff were very nice and cocktails excellent   Bartender even accommodated request to reduce alcohol content in cocktails but kept flavor and taste   Would return but not in colder months of the year 
R0205,Nice place  great cocktails
R0205,Nice  cosy vibe with candles and an old fashioned decor 
R0205,They put 3 people next to us for a table meant for 2  My wife had to eat   food which arrived cold  sitting sideways  When we complained they agreed the table was meant for 2 and our hostess went to speak with a manager  No manager arrived and no apology given  Told us we should have told them earlier the food was cold 
R0205,Not enjoyable 
R0205,"Not great for brunch  much nicer options near by 
Drinks are very good but had to wait a long time to be served "
R0205,Not great  poor service only one bar man making cocktails very very slow service
R0205,Not too busy   friendly  efficient service    cocktails are fantastic  expertly crafted  
R0205,One of the best places to have a couple cocktails on the face of the planet 
R0205,"Ordered �a meal through Justeat waited 40 mins phoned them they said did not receive order  fair enough wanted to charge me more because i phoned the order in told them to do one lost a customer tonight  their are non so blind that those who cannot see 

Crazy decision for a business what do you think "
R0205,Outdoor area freezing  Heaters inadequate  
R0205,Outdoor area freezing  Food so so 
R0205,Outdoor space and inside section two completely different worlds   
R0205,Terrace is horrible  
R0205,Outstanding service  great food  would highly recommend 
R0205,Over rated and Over Priced  Slow service too dark decor left little to be desired no entertainment beyond disappointing considering the hype    And the waitress got our bill wrong  Majority of cocktails were ice and of all of u one person enjoyed them out of 8  POOR EFFORT 
R0205,"Overall we had a good time as the cocktails were lovely  But we had a exyrenely rude encounter with the hostess at the end of the night 

I had booked a table for 7 45 which we arrived for on time   And at 10 15 pm we received a round of cocktails to be told that they were gonna give us the bill as they needed the table by for the next booking  which was the first we had heard of   

And at 10 25 we had the hostess approach us and rudely say that we needed to leave as the next booking had arrived  although we still had half of our drinks left  She did not ask was it okay or explain it to us   she just tild us we had to leave then walked away  She gave us no opportunity to discuss and I felt it was extremely inappropriate "
R0205,Overpriced and impressed with itself    Cocktails are nothing amazing but deep list to chose from    Service was slow  very slow and snobby   Lower level was nothing special   Skip it 
R0205,Warm appetizers were served cold   Service was slow  very slow and snobby   Lower level was nothing special   Skip it 
R0205,Overrated and expensive  There are better places to drink cocktails
R0205,Perfect cocktails with a great atmosphere
R0205,Poor service
R0205,"Poor service and poor food  Reheated chips and a chopped up square fish portion in the fish box  When I complained that usually there were small cuts of real fish in the box the server shrugged  sneered and said ""thats how we do it""  A true example of adding insult to injury  My advise  Eat somewhere else "
R0205,poor service only one bar man making cocktails very very slow service
R0205,Poor service  Poor food
R0205,Pure Bliss  Awesome Food  Fabulous Cocktails  Loved every minute of it
R0205,Quite possibly the worst kebab in the world   Should be ashamed   Im ashamed of myself for going there
R0205,Quite possibly the worst kebab in the world  How is it possible to make something taste so bad after 5 pints  Should be ashamed   Im ashamed of myself for going there
R0205,Really cool aesthetic  amazing cocktail and delicious food with friendly and informative service   Will definitely go back 
R0205,"Really cool place Our server a young guy was really helpful with lots of knowledge and interest in the drinks The music is really chilled out blues and old time soul Very comfortable and different Each drink is  Euro 11 95 which is worth noting as we had 3 drinks each It would be a spot to go before heading on 
I would highly recommend tho"
R0205,Really enjoyed it  fab place 
R0205,Really good venue for a friendly get together  AnnMaire our server was very knowledgeable and friendly  Recommended drinks to suit us 
R0205,Really loved the aesthetic and general atmosphere  The cocktails were fantastically quirky  I would definitely recommend it 
R0205,Really nice place  well decorated and comfortable  Ideal to enjoy amazing cocktails with friends
R0205,Really nice staff  Friendly and good service  Rooftop for smoking was fine  but could be cleaned more
R0205,"Seating booked for roof area  the roof was closed and it was about 22 degrees outside; there was a heater on on a wall above us  it was unbearably warm  apparently the staff could not turn the heater off  a waiter moved us to a table on the lower floor 
The food was very good but the tables are very small for comfortable dining; the cocktails were very good but inconsistent from roof level to lower level 
Its really a cocktail bar pretending to be a restaurant as well"
R0205,Second time visiting this place  and well   if you know you know 
R0205,Service   not great  guy didnt showed much interest to serve  Lazy attitude 
R0205,Service was shockingly bad 
R0205,Service was shockingly bad   we were there for 90 mins and only 1 cocktail as the service was so slow 
R0205,We left  rude staff ruined the atmosphere and I can think of plenty of places where the staff are friendlier and inviting 
R0205,Service was slow with little crowd  waitress with the biggest scowl Ive seen took our order  rolled her eyes at a request of a gin and tonic  and stormed off muttering something 
R0205,Service was terrible  waited 40mins to get the bill
R0205,Served a steak without the peppercorn sauce  the pork without the apple pureee  one girl taking drink orders and she was up and down the stairs like a yo yo  wanted to order another cocktail but took so long decided it was time to leave 
R0205,Something truly different tucked in Dublin City  Great for a special occasion  Staff  ambience and cocktails all great
R0205,Spectacular cocktails  great food and great ambience  wonderful staff as well 
R0205,Staff could be more attentive and friendly  Overall good experience 
R0205,Stephen was an excellent bartender and conversationalist  12/10 would go again
R0205,Such a fab experience  The service was amazing and of course the drinks were excellent as always  
R0205,Such a fun and quiet little speak easy  The cocktails are amazing  Get the millionaire  Its an off menu delight 
R0205,"Such a lovely place  A true hidden treasure  
Service was fabulous by the wonderful AnneMarie  Would highly recommended x"
R0205,Terrible service  would not recommend this place at all  The staff gave us the bill when we hadnt finished our first drink  The manager was surprisingly rude when my friend complained about the waiter  I will never go back 
R0205,Thanks to Annemarie  and  Hugo for a fantastic night and exceptional service
R0205,The  club is amazing  The staff are really friendly and the cocktails are lovely  Would definitely recommend 
R0205,The atmosphere is nice and they have an extensive list of interesting cocktails but the food was small to share and overpriced  The online menu did not match the one they served us at night and it was really disappointing  Good spot to have cocktails with friends but I would not recommend for eating out 
R0205,"The chips and curry were dismal  Huddle round kids and let me tell you why 
The good news is I think the chips were potatoes  but they were a wet soggy mess  The curry was bland  even after the owner asked me if I wanted mild because I assume because Im a cracker  I said extra hot 

Anyways  not great"
R0205,The cocktails were very inconsistent  One of the people in our group ordered the same drink twice because she loved the first one  however the second one was quite different in the the spice levels werent as high but the sweetness was nearly overbearing  I would have thought that consistency would be something that remains crucial before creativity 
R0205,The cocktails and service were fantastic   Drinks were reasonably priced for the location and caliber of the drinks   Highly recommend making reservations as seats are limited 
R0205,The cold was unreal  asked to moved away from the draught
R0205,The entrance is soooo deceiving   Lovely seating with open fires   love this place   Will defo go again 
R0205,The food and drinks were fantastic  The service was terrible  We left right after another table couldnt get their order taken  Then we had to get the check from the seaters on our way out  One waitress was doing all she could  unfortunately ours was not 
R0205,The food and service was wonderful  Sabitia was our server and provided us with an amazing birthday experience  Thank you 
R0205,The food is exquisite but the tasting menu is poor value as not enough meat options and still feel hungry at the end of it which is not great when youre paying 125 euros per head  incl wine    
R0205,The place is just amazing  Lovely experience from beginning to end  I have already reccommended to a friend and shes going next week 
R0205,"The service this time was terrible  We were seated and then ordered drinks along with water  Two other tables were seated shortly after and their drinks arrived before our water did 
Then  after dinner I ordered a cheese tray  was ignored  then when asked where the cheese tray was; I was told the kitchen was closed 
Terrible service overall "
R0205,"The service was awful  Staff were rude and horrible  I would never recommend and will be leaving a review on trip advisor 
Stay away "
R0205,The service was terrible  It took 15 minutes from ringing the door bell to reaching the table  Despite this we were expected to leave the table on time  It was very difficult to order food and additional drinks  We were always trying to catch attention of staff while they frantically ran around  We would have spent a lot more money had the service been more efficient

R0205,The seven of us got great service and even better cocktails at this hidden Gem   Happy we found it 
R0205,The staff are very friendly and helpful and the cocktails were great  I would recommend it to everyone 
R0205,The staff were extremely rude and rushed  The food and cocktails were nice  but there was a tense atmosphere  The staff were fighting at the bar and not very accommodating 
R0205,The table we had was made for two  not four  and could barely fit our food on it   wouldnt go again 
R0205,They never notified us      Totally irresponsible
R0205,This experience was not what I expected 
R0205,"There was only one issue with the night but it completely ruined it  The whole dining room was freezing  Myself and my girlfriend had to keep our coats on for the duration of the dinner  along with everyone at the tables around us  We werent able to relax as a result of this  This is not what you expect when you go out for dinner  especially considering the fact that our bill was roughly  Euro 150  The dining room should not be beside an open stairs which goes directly up to a room which is outside 

The food and drink was nice and our waitress was very friendly but unfortunately  this was not enough to make up for how uncomfortable the experience was "
R0205,"This is my second time visiting this establishment and I feel it has gone down hill  I love the concept of it  knocking on a secret door and being led upstairs but that was really it  The bar is very understaffed and with the bar being booked out all the time its a long wait for people waiting on drinks  

The waitress didnt offer any help on the selection of cocktails which in a bar like that with a menu as long I feel the waitress should interact and recommend some cocktails  We ordered two rounds of drinks  The first round for me was very disappointing  For the price you are paying I would expect a little more  We decided to ask if they could do an expresso martini for us which was no issue but to be honest it wasnt even a great expresso martini  The fact you are paying 12 euro a pop for this and tip also because its table service I wouldnt say its worth it at all 

We have visited a similar establishment which is owned by the same company which is by far ten times better  Waiters are quick to help you out with what to drink because they know how extensive the menu us and they provide entertainment while making the cocktails too  

I feel this place has gone downhill and are not making enough effort because their name is established in Dublin now  I have heard negative reviews about this place for the last few months  Dont think we will be back anytime soon "
R0205,This place is an absolute gem of Dublin  The staff are practiced in their craft and perfect in their professionalism 
R0205,This place is great if youre looking for something fancier than a night at the pub 
R0205,This place is hard to find  but well worth the effort  The cocktail menu is 26 pages  broken out in the different golden ages of coctails 
R0205,"This place is very hard to find  We had to ring to find it as its up a back stairwell along a building that has no signs for entry through the door  

The price of the cocktail was expensive for what we got  Two very standard cocktails youd get anywhere else   Euro 25 for two  "
R0205,This place is such a cool little speakeasy  and was perfect for a nice date night while on vacation  The food was delicious and the cocktails are perfection 
R0205,The waitress did not want to be there and was very rude  no friendliness whatsoever  A weird vibe  lots of couples making out with each other in the upstairs smoking area/garden outdoor terrace 
R0205,The food is ok  nothing special  of note  they bring your entire order at once  starter  and  main courses  and  everything is crowded onto the tiny table  The atmosphere is chaotic  not relaxing at all  This place is great if you want to meet friends for one drink before going someplace good  The problem is the management  because there was only 1 waitress  and  1 bartender handling all of the tables  which had about 50 folks sitting around them 
R0205,This place was not as advertised  The service is horrible  takes 20 min to get your drink  and  good luck trying to order a second one 
R0205,This place was recommended by a friend and I was not disappointed  Had a simply super evening sipping on cocktails and catching up with the girls
R0205,This speakeasy never lets me down  Always amazing food  drinks  and service  Every time I travel to Ireland this is a must  
R0205,This was a gem of a place and very well priced considering its location  fantastic and the smoking area is pretty much indoors  Fantastic 
R0205,This was a wonderful experience and fun trip back in time   The drinks were perfect and the food was delicious 
R0205,"Will take good photos for cocktails and food etc for instagram but not much else  Prices are no where to be seen on menu 

If your looking for a good time this is not the place to be  Ideal for people who like a very quite atmosphere  Could here a pin drop it was so quite "
R0205,"Took them ages to open door and was seated at the bar for food  when booked a table not bar 

Tables are very small and too close together  No atmosphere  quite dull and flat "

R0205,Tourist trap  I wouldnt go back and it took me 45mins to get the check 
R0205,Unfortunately I was disappointed with my visit  2 days before Christmas and my friend and I were there for our Xmas night out  having travelled from glasgow  There were only 2 of us  and I had a Christmas jumper on  I was made to take this off at the door  so basically sat at the bar in a t shirt  the reason they have was that it didnt fit with their dress code and it wasnt appropriate and was more geared for a stag do  given there were 2 of us and it was 2 days before Xmas  I found this quite unnecessary and over the top  We ordered 2 drinks and had to wait around 20 minutes for them  despite the bar not being overly busy  the cocktails were ok  but for 12 Euro a drink  I would expect more  We left after one and had a brilliant time at numerous other bars in temple Bar  Unfortunately it was not the experience we had hoped for 
R0205,Unfortunately there was no food available when we arrived   The kitchen was closed due to unforseen circumstances  Itwas disappointing as we planned eating there also 
R0205,Unreal cocktails  stunning setting in a cosy  secret location  Service was great
R0205,Usually a great experience   Bad experience with food had to send back chicken wings twice they were cold  No toilet paper in the ladies  Great waitress k ow her cocktails but was a slow service 
R0205,Very bad service  waited for 20 mins for waitress and by the time we ordered the kitchen was closed  No atmosphere  wont be going ever again and will be recommending others to stay away 
R0205,Very cool vibe  Pretty hidden location  but was fun to find  I had the Purple Pearl and my husband had the best mule he ever had  Must do 
R0205,"Very disappinted by food
And it was SO cold inside     
The cocktails are OK but not great
The place is hard to find  small and cosy but freezing    "
R0205,"Very disappointed on sat night   Was expecting lovely couches  and  lampshades in a secluded bar   We arrived  and  went upstairs to a roof terrace to be seated in a Tiny corner   surroundings were awful  and  smoking around us   
 When we left  we went down a different stairs  and  was so disappointed to see that downstairs was what I was expecting with lovely seating  and  surrounding    
This was a special occasion for us  and  we were all very disappointed "
R0205,This was a special occasion for us  and  we were all very disappointed 
R0205,"Very disappointing place  Usually Im not complaining  but there are my reasons:
1  Difficult to find
2  Interior like in the  fallout movies  naked wires  nothing matches  cracked walls  old worn furniture 
"
R0205, Food is scantily and overpriced  You pay 13 Euro  for 5 wings tasting like quick boiled chicken  Overpriced cocktails  13 Euro  for 50cl glass  nothing special  average taste 
R0205,However the portions were small and the menu limited  We left after an hour  almost  Euro 100 euros lighter and went for food somewhere else  If you like value for money   avoid  Just for a cocktail or two   not too bad 
R0205,Very disappointing visit after a fabulous stay in Dublin  This was by far our worst experience in Dublin  I booked this restaurant/cocktail bar for a chilled night of ambience with my husband  Service was slow  waitress was rude and our drinks kept coming separately  I definitely would not recommend eating here   its moderately expensive  which we didnt mind  we are in a city after all   
R0205,Very disappointing  this was our 3rd visit   I booked my table on Thursday and on Friday received a text to confirm I would be coming which I answered   On arrival we were taken upstairs as our table wasnt ready  we were then taken down 2 levels and were the only people there this is not not where we were expecting to be seated  I asked if we could be  moved upstairs and someone came and said they had tried to call me the previous day to confirm I was coming   I had confirmed by text  they said a table would be free soon and we could move  this did not happen until nearly an hour and we were on our 2nd cocktail by then so stayed as we would be leaving soon  On previous visits we were given a small Prosecco on arrival  we did not get this   we did not enjoy our visit at all it was so disappointing  considering we paid  Euro 100 for the pleasure  Unfortunately we will not be returning we come to Dublin every year from Glasgow but will not be back  
R0205,"Very good cocktails  no where else could compare during our visit  Friendly staff with good knowledge of their brand   
I highly recommend  
We didnt eat there  so cant comment on the food  although I cant seem to leave a revire without rating it "
R0205,Very interesting place  Loved the whole experience 
R0205,"Very Nice Venue  Great Service 
Nice Selection Of Cocktails  and  Food 
Recommend Highly "
R0205,"Very very disappointed with our night on 4/11/17
Poor slow service 
Club was freezing cold had to be moved downstairs where it was no better we were absolutely frozen when leaving club
Arrived at 1700 1st Cocktail served at 1745 handed a bill at 1910 which was not requested by me
Did complain waitress said sorry no offer of a complimentary drink or a visit from a supervisor 
"
R0205,Very very disappointed Not good enough  and  an unenjoyable experience
R0205,Visited after being recommended  like the idea of the cocktail bar however few problems    table we were sat at was freezing   Luckily the waitress took pity on us shivering eventually and offered for us to be moved    service was VERY slow  I appreciate them being busy but the couple who were seated before us had ordered  being served their drinks and starters and had finished these in the time it took for us to have our drinks orders taken    werent offered a food menu which would have been nice however due to the long wait for drinks didnt ask for one and went somewhere else wed found on google waiting to be served    the decor  theme and cocktails were amazing though which is why Ive given 3 stars  Maybe on a different day would get the 5 stars 
R0205,Visited after  recommendation  but totally let down by food and service 
R0205,Waited 15 mins for first round of drinks after server took 10 mins to greet us  Server made no recommendations on food or drinks  basically an order taker   Food came out cold but the server came back to check in 20 mins later so it was too late to send it back   We ordered another round of drinks which then we waved down another server to check on as it had been another 15 mins and come to find out our server never put the order in   Terrible experience and highly overrated   
R0205, When paying around 15 euro a drink  you expect more  Did not meet my expectations
R0205,We arrived at 3 30 to discover that we had no booking or table  then it was discovered that the booking was cancelled  which I dont know how either occurred as I booked it myself for me and my sister who was visiting from abroad  I had not seen her in months and wanted to do something special  The host made no apologies and was  quite quiet and rude  We were seated upstairs in the smoking area and neither of us smoke  we wanted brunch and were told we had to wait until change of menu at five  It clearly states on the website that brunch is served til 4pm  After stating this we were reluctantly given menus  We asked to be moved downstairs when a table  became free  The hostess just at me and said there was none when I saw three free walking up the stairs  The food itself was good  the cocktails were amazing and the second waitress was nice  While eating in the smoke filled room the hostess came back and told us we were taking up two tables and to move over  Two plates would not fit on the table   I thought I was going to have to eat it on my knee  when I said hang on a minute there have been many things not right since we arrived and I am not paying to eat my food on my lap  while I felt I had to apologise to the couple who were waiting to be seated but no tables were left   The host did not look at us or apologise for the suggestion at all  We felt like an inconvenience and paid 70 euro for the hour experience  Really disappointing  I have been here frequently since opening and this treatment of customers I have never experienced before  My sister and I did not have the afternoon we had planned  Our evening fabulously had a much better service and experience following this terrible brunch  I will not be returning   I dont normally write reviews but I feel very strongly about this experience 
R0205,We attended for our annual Christmas get together to enjoy food and drinks  We felt rushed from the table when the club was not full  Not sure that I would return in a hurry 
R0205, Food was ok  nothing outstanding  Service was attentive but could have been friendlier  Where we were seated was not ideal  a group of girls next to a couple when there were many other more suitable tables free  
R0205,We came from Denmark to Dublin for the weekend with some friends and one of the things we prioritised with our time was an evening here  We wanted to show them what we had experienced a few years that we found unique an wonderful  This time we felt rushed and in the way  The service was not up to standard   there was no smile and we where seated next to the kitchen and we where asked to leave after we had our food  We had hoped to sit and have cocktails and tall for quite a while but chose to leave as the waitress told us that she needed to seat other guests   we had dinner at 20 15  we where not early guest and therefore we had hoped to stay and spend our money here  In stead we went elsewhere 
R0205,We had a fantastic time in here  It was such a shame when we had to leave that the next place we went to was terrible in comparison 
R0205,We had a fantastic time with amazing Cocktails and great food 
R0205,We had a table booked but had to wait 20min for it to be ready  We then waited another 20min at our table and we were never served  Waste of time 
R0205,The service that we  received upon arrival and when we asked to be served was very poor  We left without ordering because we were never given a chance  
R0205,We had some birthday drinks there it was good as expected
R0205,We left early because after ordering/receiving one round of cocktails and food  we never saw our server again to order more  Disappointed  we went to another restaurant and finished our evening  There appeared to be only one server working  but two hostesses for the half empty restaurant 
R0205,We liked the drinks but were seated in the smoking area not as told originally when they called for the reservation and it was so cold as well really uncozy
R0205,We loved this place but didnt realise customers were allowed to smoke upstairs  Unfortunately the smell of smoke prevented us from staying longer  especially as we had to go upstairs to use the toilets 
R0205,We were booked in for 5pm but arrived 20 mins late but still accommodated  Not very busy on the level we were on but it was early  Im sure this is a place I could love to relax in and enjoy more of their cocktails but the place was so cold that once we finished our meal and cocktail each we had to leave  Having to put coat on half way through meal we really couldnt stay any longer  Staff had brought out fan heaters immediately prior to our departure  and not on our request  but it was too late for us then  Would consider visiting again as I like that style 
R0205,We were celebrating my husbands 40th birthday and thought this would be a great experience having read the reviews   We had a phone call from the restaurant at 5 to confirm we were coming for dinner  When we arrived we were seated and the venue looked amazing   We were given the cocktail menu and not until after wed ordered and starting drinking out cocktails did they announce that they couldnt serve food as they had a problem in the kitchen   We then struggled to find anywhere else to eat as we hadnt got a reservation   Very disappointing and felt a little bit conned as they didnt inform us when we arrived that we couldnt eat 
R0205,Went for a friends birthday  it was relaxed and fun  our waiter was very friendly  organised a dessert candle etc   very chatty   cocktails were fab 
R0205,Went out for cocktails and dinner and booked the 5 7 30 slot  Was seated in the basement beside a big red curtain that was there to block the view into the kitchen  Felt like I was being smothered by it  Table was tiny and couldnt fit legs underneath  Very uncomfortable  Chairs were just cylindrical type foot stools on one side and a bench on the other  An adult would not fit on the stools  They were tiny and more suitable for a child  Very uncomfortable and there was no way I could sit there for two hours with no back support without needing an anti inflammatory  I couldnt imagine how we were meant to eat at this tiny table I actually felt claustrophobic there  I asked to be moved and we were put upstairs where the piano and fireplace are which was much nicer but many seats including the ones where we put were the tiny footstool type  We took the table as any ones with proper chairs were reserved  Luckily after a few minutes the couple beside us left and we moved into the corner where we could both sit on the bench type seat so our backs were fine  Cocktails were gorgeous and food very good  I devoured a steak and chips and chicken wings starter  Ordered chocolate trio for dessert which was very disappointing  Cake was rich but little flavor and ice cream melting beside it  Didnt finish  Would defo go back but insist on a table with chairs with backs  We were 2 women not masssive in size so cannot imagine how a fully grown man would fit 
R0205,What an experience  loved everything from the knocking on the door to the fab cocktails  Will definitely be back
R0205,What to say about this incredible place  I just love the food  the cocktails and the ambiance  The staff are always friendly and attentive 
R0205,Wont find better cocktails  Amazing space  Great food  <3 Go here 
R0205,Would definitely return  lots of charm  lots of cocktail choice  A great place to while away the hours in Dublin  5 star 
R0206,Absolutely adored my night out with a friend for a few glasses of lovely wine  great selection of food to share and lovely ambience to chat the night away  Would highly recommend this spot and look forward to visiting again soon 
R0206,Absolutely fab  Beautiful food  wine and atmosphere  Great value also  highly recommend 
R0206,Absolutely loved this restaurant  Food and service was amazing  lovely ambience 
R0206,Amazing food and great service  will come back again
R0206,Amazing service and attention  Food fab and great ambiance
R0206,Came in here after hearing some jazz coming from inside  Beautiful decor  great drinks and wonderful jazz  Chairs were super comfy and service was great 
R0206,Delicious food and great service 
R0206,Despite it being a chain   the atmosphere is not touristy  �Good kids prix fixe meals  �Neopolitan style pizza 
R0206,Great lively pub  authentic experience with live music every night  Plenty of food options and friendly efficient staff 
R0206,Great place  great crepes and wine  Cosy place
R0206,"Great restaurant  Amazing food  Love that you can splash out on an expensive wine and bring
It with you "
R0206,Great tasting crepes and wonderful staff  A lovely change from the usual dinner 
R0206,Grigor  and  Redmond and The Team at this restaurant were simply terrific 
R0206,I absolutely love this place  Awesome food  great  cozy atmosphere  and the service is outstanding  Will definitely be back 
R0206,I absolutely love this place  �Great food and pizzas  �If youre lucky great fish  Tiny hidden away place
R0206,I enjoyed m lunch and look forward to going again some evening
R0206,I loved the place  It is romantic for a couple and very charming to go with friends  The food was delicious  And the service very good  I just thought a bit overpriced but even like that I would totally recommended as a special place 
R0206,I opted for a a healthy food option of the whiskey chicken  it came with baby potatoes and root veg  It was quite slimming world friendly which is always good for me   Even though it was a healthy option it was so flavoursome and filling  And my boyfriend went for the fish and chip which was a really decent size portion and he said it was really tasty  The prices are quite affordable and the food is well worth the money  
R0206,Dont go there  there is way better if you want a burger in town 
R0206,"Id seen this place many times driving through  its just up from the cinema  The front is sleek and welcoming and I kept meaning to try it out  

So I did  Last Friday night myself and a friend went for a late dinner  The staff were lovely  the table wasnt ready immediately so they seated us at the bar  I ordered a freshly pressed apple juice  unfortunately  from my prime seat at the bar I could see it was poured from a standard juice carton  Not ideal  But the waiter did seem to have a good knowledge of the wine list so that was great  

Our table was in the front section  the place was hopping and the atmosphere was brilliant  

We ordered the nachos  chicken wings and chips to share  The portions were good and big  Our little bucket of wings was delicious  the good old spicy vinegary kind   Nonetheless  we polished the whole lot off without too much trouble  I must admit as well that I think there main courses were probably where they shine  I saw a few served to tables near us and they looked great  

All in all  despite a few minor negatives  we really enjoyed Riba  Its good food at reasonable prices and the next time Im ordering a main course "
R0206,Ive been here twice and plan on coming back until Ive tried the entire menu at least a handful of times   The staff are lovely  the food is amazing and the restaurant itself is gorgeous   Highly recommend a visit 
R0206,Lovely decor  gorgeous food and great staff  Super wine list too 
R0206,Lovely food and athmosphere  However the service was dreadful  Our order didnt go through the computer so after 25 minute wait for pate and crab  both cold dishes   we told them we were still waiting  They apologised then gave us nibbles on the house  then change of waitress  then slow enough with main course  again cold so not a lot of prep in it  then slow with the wine  All in all a poor experience from a service point of view
R0206,Lovely food  Really nice atmosphere  Great   service  Highly recommend
R0206,Lovely little find  Great menu  and  nice food  Nice atmosphere 
R0206,Order a small meal but it was amazing
R0206,17 euro should get you more than having to ask someone to pour you ice cream  Not allowed to use the ice cream machine on your own is absolutely absurd  �Multiple meat dishes couldve have easily been dog for all
R0206,Really good good  the waiters were really nice
R0206,Ricky is the best   Food was great and so was the wine  
R0206,Servers very unfriendly  very slow  Crepe Suzette delicious  Good view reasonable wine list   Food basic but not expensive  Will not make a return visit
R0206,Solid authenticate Irish food that caters to families and those who want an early start/ early finish  The service is �of a high standard which is why this pub rates higher than its neighbours 
R0206,Solid pizza  quick and cheap enough  Nothing better after midnight on a Saturday 
R0206,Such an amazing place  Really cosy  really lovely staff  tasty crepes and delicious wine 
R0206,The crepes are delicious and its a good place to meet friends 
R0206,The only thing better than the food was the service  Lovely evening and such a nice setting  10/10
R0206,The place is really cute  Perfect for all occasions especially a nice date  The food is really good and staff members are very nice  Highly recommend 
R0206,the place is very small  and at one point you have to wait for a free spot  however the tasty food and the excellent service make up for that 
R0206,The tarts and sweets we had were super good and the staff was friendly  Seems like a great spot for a casual afternoon lunch 
R0206,"This place was severely disappointing  the crepes were nothing special  and they did not even have the crepes that they advertise on their Facebook page  staff was extremely rude  sarcastic  and inattentive  when we complained about the banoffee crepe not being on the menu  the manager got very defensive and loud 

Summary  its a waste of time and money to go there "
R0206,"This place is freaking amazing 

Great coffee  great pastries  PHENOMENAL food    I just love all of it  

Ordered the egg and avocado  husband ordered the eggs menemen  both were delicious "
R0206,This place was a great find  The food was simple but very well done  delicious and filling for great value  The wine selection was great and the decor and atmosphere were wonderful  Would highly recommend for a date or a relaxed dinner with friends 
R0206,Visited her last night it was amazing  The food and wine was great quality and full of flavour  I cant wait to go back
R0206,"Wednesday night and the restaurant was pleasantly busy  Friendly helpful staff 
The Vegetarian tasting menu was amazing 
We will be back soon "
R0207,Amazing place  I have tried most Italian restauranta in Dublin and this is by far the best 
R0207,We had to send our mains back to be heated up and this was very disappointing  The food was really nice but its never nice to send food back to the kitchen  I wouldnt be comfortable recommending it to someone else on the basis of this  For a menu with a very italian feel  the food did not really live up to expectation  sorry
R0208,I got the wings  and  Mac and cheese while my bf got a burger and fries  The Mac and cheese and fries were really good and the wings and burgers were okay  I got the blazin sauce for my wings and they were not spicy at all  which was disappointing because it was labeled as spicy  The wings werent dry which was good but nothing to die for  
R0208,The food wasnt good to me or my friend it just wasnt what we thought it was going to be
R0208,"To note: In order to write a review I had to give a star rating in all areas  

I booked a table for 8:30pm last Saturday in this restaurant for 3 people  My partner and I were taking a friend home from abroad out for dinner and a catch up  Once I mentioned Brazilian BBQ to the others we were all really excited about dinner 
When we arrived a lady eventually asked could she help us  I said we had a booking for 8:30pm  She sighed and looked around her  Then looked around some more  Then went to what I assume was a reservations book and asked my name  I gave her the name  number of people and time of booking  The conversation then went like this:
""You have booked for across the road "" 
No  no Ive definitely booked for here 
""No  you havent youre not in the book ""  sigh 
I have the booking right here on my phone  
 blank stare  ""Well were very busy tonight  so     "" 
So thats why I booked 
""You see we have a 100 people here for dinner  Were very busy          ""  staring at me in silence  ""Ok fine one moment ""
At this point my partner said to me ""lets leave  she could only be clearer if she actually said sod off  "" But I wanted to see what would happen  The lady spoke to a tall man I assume was a manager and after some more looking around the room came back and then showed us to a table  We decided to give the benefit of the doubt and enjoy the meal  A friendly waitress arrived to take our order and we all ordered the all you can eat brazilian bbq  This ""experience"" was the entire reason for coming to this restaurant to begin with  She asked us to hang on a moment and disappeared off to speak to the tall manager type again  She reappeared to inform us that there was no all you can eat brazilian bbq and there was no brazilian bbq at all  It was only order off the menu  excluding bbq  of course   
At this point we could see an evening of disappointment and indigestion ahead of us if we stayed  So we left "
R0209,A great night with great service despite how busy it was   Super tasty food  Great value  Happy attentive staff 
R0209,Adorable little savory pie shop tucked away on an alley street away There park bench style starting inside 
R0209,Although the waitress was nice  the service was very slow and we had to say /ask for things a few times  Food wasnt worth the money  mine was cold  In comparison to other places around town for brunch it just doesnt measure up 
R0209,Brunch  Took a two year old   which this restaurant is totally inappropriate for  no highchairs or booster seats   No flexibility in substitutions  Im pregnant and they wouldnt do scrambled instead of poached eggs  Another request to simply even remove black pudding from the meal  no substitution  was denied  Sad as I went here a few years before and it was so much better  They seem to have lost their customer care 
R0209,Brunch  Tasty as always 
R0209,Chips were burnt and even after telling the waitress we still got charged
R0209,Cocktails  brunch  ginfusions  desserts    everything here is so moreish  Their pistachio cr�me brulee is my new favorite thing
R0209,"Did the early bird   for 2 people with 2 glases of wine   spent 70 euros  not worth it  I paid extra  Euro 6 for my stake   it wasnt cooked as i asked and it was so chewy that the stake knife couldnt even cut it  and my fingers were sore 
The wqiter sisnt know what was celeriac stake  my friend ordered this   and it wasnt a stake  it was just minc with a thick piece of celeriac on top 
Cheesecake was flavourless   i felt we wasted the money and was raging as i really wanted a good stake "
R0209,Disappointed  Food was hit and miss   Duck was the worst 
R0209,Disappointing experience overall  Of the 3 steaks orded  only 1 was cooked right  1 was sent back to be cooked a little more and was subsequently forgotten about  A new steak had to then be cooked  which led to 1 person eating long after everyone else had finished  No fresh sides were brought with the second steak to replace the ones that were obviously cold at that stage  3 of the desserts were supposed to chocolate mousse  but could only be described as bowls of chocolate sauce  Nobody could eat them  The response of the staff was to knock off one dessert and one steak supplement  Total  Euro 10   not good enough  And they saw no issue with putting a  Euro 40 service charge on the bill  High points were the chicken wings  fish and prawn dishes  They were excellent 
R0209,Disgracefully expensive for basic food  fajitas as high as 25 Euro   Seriously get a grip and stop trying to take advantage of �the public/tourists who are visiting our country  I would advice a drastic price change in the menu and maybe a better variety as I was extremely disappointed  Chips dry and feel as if they are microwaved  burgers are basic no thrills just average 
R0209,"Either a bad night or the standards have slipped a lot since my last visit  Ill start with the good; the ribs were top notch  The steaks were mediocre  and the pepper sauce was insipid  The home fries side was small and looked like they came frozen in a bag  It was very expensive for what we got  We told our waitress that the food was ""just ok""  and she just said ""oh  hmm"" and wandered off  We wont be going back in a hurry "
R0209,"Fairly mediocre experience  

Coffees were lukewarm when they arrived 

50 percent of our tables poached eggs were solid in the middle and overcooked "
R0209,Food is ok; not great quality; soggy stodgy bun on my friends dish and my smoked salmon wasnt great quality  It has a reputation for a great brunch  but this is not the best that Dublin has to offer
R0209,Great food and a lively atmosphere  I would highly recommend 
R0209,Great Thursday night early bird menu  The food was really good with lots of variety available and loads of flavor on starters and mains 
R0209,Had a great evening here for our anniversary last week  For starters we shared the wings which were hotttt   Lots of water was needed   which is constantly topped up by waiters  win   We both opted for the steak which is cooked to your liking and comes with a side of chips or potato puree ~ which tasted like a fork of delightful fluff    only downside to the dish was the pepper sauce which didnt taste much like pepper sauce at all   And we got the honeycomb icecream dessert which was very filling  There was a great atmosphere in the place and staff we very efficient  but it was freeeeezing  Seated a bit away from the door and then aircon blasting down on top of us was not fun  We would probably return to try the burgers in a warmer climate  
R0209,Had been here  about two years ago and really enjoyed the experience   The food was tasty and presented well   As a Birthday treat decided to return with some friends   It was a Wednesday evening and we went for the early bird menu   The food was disappointing   It looked tired  was a bit on the cool side and not partuclarly tasty    Service and ambience was good    However the food  spoilt the experience for us all
R0209,Having read glowing reviews about this restaurant for brunch  I was terribly disappointed with my experience there  Despite calling in advance  the staff refused to fit in one extra person at our table for 5  When we arrived  we were surprised to see that there were empty tables and a little effort could easily have accommodated us  The food was mediocre at best  the portions were small and the staff were unfriendly and unhelpful  The only positive aspect was the coffee  which was delicious 
R0209,I had heard such great things about the brunch here  but it was so disappointing  The food was definitely below standard  I asked for the sourdough with avocado  and  eggs  with the tomato fondue on the side   However   the fondue came on the bread  and soaked it   it was quite tasteless  and didnt do anything for the dish apart from make the piece of bread soggy  There was very little avocado  and the asparagus was very over cooked  The nutella waffles were nice  but we had to request nutella as there was so little on them  barely noticeable  Also  there were very limited tea options   no mint / decaf tea etc  Surprising for a high end brunch venue  The service was poor  and very inattentive  All in all  not the best experience for myself and my 2 friends 
R0209,I had high hopes for this little place  its so central and looks so cute from the outside  The decor is lovely and a lunchtime is was a nice mix of bustly enough to have an atmosphere but not busy enough that you need to have made a booking  They run a special lunch menu that a main cours and a soft drink for  Euro 10  not bad value  I had the spaghetti and meatballs which was pretty good  the best bit was definitely the tomato sauce which has actual tomatoes in it  not always the case    meatballs a bit average 
R0209,I would highly recommend reserving the indoor space with a couple friends for an fun intimate meal   great place to start the night 
R0209, feel this is a huge downfall in the irish food industry  where they dont try to apologise 
R0209,Just went there for dinner  My wife had pasta and I had pizza  Both were great  Yes the menu has a lot of options  but the there are many pizzas and pastas 
R0209,Long wait to be seated despite the restaurant being half empty  Some of the food was now fresh  English muffin was starting to stale and the guacamole salsa was very cold having come from a fridge  
R0209,Love going here for brunch  tasty food  friendly service 
R0209,Love this location  Offer a great variety of food   Pizza  burgers  etc  really friendly staff and great prices are here two days in a row during my stay
R0209,Lovely brunch
R0209,Nice place  cool setting and the burritos themselves are delicious  Not as big as other places in dublin  but thats actually a good thing  you dont leave the place feeling overly stuffed  I got mine in a box and the student deal is great value
R0209,Not value for money and the pizza is tasteless  The chips and garlic bread that is offered with the meal deals are not the best and taste like cardboard
R0209,Ok  nice enough  Food good but pricey had better for less  Good for pre theatre
R0209,Would never order from here again  
R0209,Previously enjoyed  and recommended  but underwhelmed by poor service and lukewarm food on this visit 
R0209,Price apart which is a general problem in Dublin and the main reason I eat out very little  the place/food are good  Charging for bread though is a bit of a nonsense in my opinion 
R0209,"Pros:
 Cool atmosphere
 Spacious downstairs bathroom  

Cons:
 Messed up my order  gave me a burger instead of chicken  
 Burger was dry 

  
Burger
Incredibly dry and unremarkable  Maybe their chicken sandwiches are better  or I may have gotten a particularly dry portion given that my sister tried it and said hers was not as dry  Regardless  unfortunately it was a disappointing meal "
R0209,"Really like the simple menu and the ambience of the place 
Myself and my girlfriend went in a month or so ago  had to wait for a table but in fairness it was 7PM on a Sunday in Dublin so it didnt both us too much  I ordered the double cheese burger and sweet potato fries and she ordered the same with regular fries �We noticed the table beside us  which seated after us  received their food first  It then transpired they were given our food by accident  The waitress was most apologetic and ensured our food would be out in no time  5 minutes later we had it �

Burger was very tasty  as were the sweet potato fries  Only issue was it was slightly too tall for my mouth  I may just have a small mouth in reality  

The waitress comped the meal bar the two drinks which was a very nice gesture due to the mix up of orders �
"
R0209,Service could be better   Waiting times to receive menus was about 5 minutes and then waiting for someone to take an order shouldnt have been as long as it was  Theyre more interested in getting people in than looking after those who are already seated  Found the food serving sizes smaller than most places  Very loud inside and its hard to hear people youre seated with  Combine this with waiters constantly bumping into your chair or clipping your seats legs doesnt make for a memorable experience  The menu is so unnecessarily large also that you cant even place it on the tiny tables they seat you at without having to pile you coffees on top of each other  Average at best 
R0209,Service was a bit ad hoc   Didnt get what we ordered so delay to get the right food 
R0209,Situated a bit outside of the touristic area  this is a very good place if youre into meat  We had the 30oz steak and it was cooked to perfection 
R0209,Tables are very small and close together   Therefore the noise levels are high   Food was nice   Beer selection is minimal with nothing on tap   What annoyed me was that they took our coats when we arrived  but never gave them back when we were leaving   We asked for our coats and were just pointed to a rack with 30/40 coats on it and only 5 or 6 hooks   My husband wrestled his way to our coats but help or assistance were not forthcoming 
R0209,The combination of inefficiency and mediocre food gets only 2 stars unfortunately 
R0209,The food was brought to us very quickly and the taste was fair  The guys serving the food were not too helpful in offering sauces or any condiments  3 Euro water bottles which I feel is over priced for a fast food fish and chips  Would not go here again 
R0209,The food was really good  no complaints about that  We had a little incident  a misunderstanding about the order  Where my parents pointed on the menu what they wanted and when the food was served they got something else  The man was very kind and gave different solutions but we decided to keep the food  Then the waiter comes back to the table with the menu to show us where we pointed   As to show we were wrong  At that point the food is there and we decided to eat it  damage is done and we are just trying to have a nice time  I was very disappointed with this as there is no point in doing that  and if she had not done it this review would have been different  They gave us dessert on the house and that was nice  But to me having a waiter or whoever is in the restaurant trying to blame the customer is just wrong  Maybe we misunderstood each other but then she should have done her job better and been sure about the order before going to the kitchen and not just looking at the fingers pointing at a menu from a distance  Either way super disappointed and wouldn�t tell anyone to go there  Lots of other great steaks and restaurants like that around Dublin 
R0209,The most delicious Salmon and Eggs  and  Eggs Benedict that weve had in a while  The price is reasonable and the portions are filling 
R0209,"The restaurant gave us a great service  and were very helpful  Amazing Atmosphere  with great settings 

The food  the most important part  was outstanding  I got the rib eye on the bone and it was cooked to perfection  medium rare  The sides and starter were quite unforgettable  but the main star of the show was the Rib eye 

Highly recommended to anyone who loves a good steak "
R0209,"The worker taking orders was quite rude  I asked her if she had any vegan options and she immediately shook her head no and said ""our cheese isnt vegan""  When I asked if the crust and sauce were vegan she said yes so I said oh  I could get a cheeseless pizza  which I would have been fine with  but her attitude was so off putting I didnt want to give them my business  She was so quick to let me know she had no interest in accommodating me  that I ordered nothing and left  Out of all the people I have met in Ireland the last 11 days  she was the only rude one "
R0209,"the worst service i have ever recieved in a restaurant  we waited 35 mins for a glass of wine and 1 hr for our meal steak was overcooked and tasteless we could not hear anything due to a large group seated right beside us
the waiter was sent home mid service due to being rude to customers  i was so disappointed as i had heard good stories  no sign of any management on the premises i really would avoid "
R0209,This is a lovely restaurant with a nice vibe according to reviews  which is why I booked it for my husbands birthday celebration  The menu is limited and we didnt fancy Sammy of the starters so went straight to other main course and ordered the chicken and celeraic after ordering two beers  After an hour we still hadnt received our main course and we summoned the waiter who apologised profusely but offered no excuse or remedy  It eventually arrived after about an hour and quarter since ordering  The food was very nice  We then ordered the cheesecake which was all we fancied on the desert menu to be told no sorry no cheesecake     Disillusioned we asked for the bill  Its a limited menu so all should be available  In fairness the drinks were taken off the bill  but I booked s night for a special occasion and that was not delivered  Unfortunately my first visit will probably be my last 
R0209,"This place has completely gone downhill since our last visit  
We visited for brunch on Sunday morning but left very disappointed with the food  Stale muffins on the Eggs Benedict and very poor Huevos Rancheros made up of mostly beans "
R0209,This restaurant is totally overpriced for the food and wine served  It is the poorest value I have experienced in a Dublin restaurant EVER  the girl serving was polite and helpful and the food is fine  but nothing warrants the prices charged  We had one starter  2 mains and a bottle of wine and it cost 120e  This is outrageous pricing 
R0209,Thoroughly enjoyed this place a few months ago  Food was spot on  Intend to return when I am down that direction again 
R0209,Very good food  Bad acoustics and impatient waitress took away from otherwise good night 
R0209,Visited on a Sat evening  A large party of 16 was in this very small dining room   Service was extremely slow  Waited over one hour after ordering to see any food  Unfortunately  our dinners were not very good   Steaks were just ok and sides were very bland   We dine out in New York City frequently  the description of this restaurant as having a NY vibe is just not accurate   Cant recommend this restaurant 
R0209,Waitress asked to take order 2 time when we were clearl6 waiting for the rest of the table to arrive  Order was lost  Waited an hour for food to arrive after asking for the delay  Was compensated with the toughest waffles Ive ever had  Would need a steak knife to cut through  Wrong bill sent to table  Pot of tea was clearly topped up with water only  No fresh teabag added  Was very weak  Very poor experience 
R0209,We both quite enjoyed it but were disappointed there was no gluten free options for brunch that werent simply something on menu without bread/tortilla 
R0209,We had the brunch menu at this was not good  we have been here on many occasions before but this time I did not enjoy the food at all 
R0209,"We ordered the blue two with chicken and I personally loved it  Definitely get the Kinsale Pale Ale if you like IPA  So yummy  PS: their chips are awesome  
Service was awesome"
R0209,We stopped here on our last night Ireland   it was a blessing and a joy  Hope its here on our next visit 
R0209,We went there for brunch and the food was mediocre  Crab cakes were cold and the bread as toasted until it was black 
R0209,We were able to reserve a table at lunch for our large group  It does get a bit loud during the height of lunch hour but we were able to hear one another  �Once we were served  we really didnt get much attention from the wait staff  We needed to ask for condiments like ketchup and vinegar  Our food was ok but nothing really stood out in flavor  
R0209,We were in 4 people and one of us were waiting for 15 min for her drink  When you ordered desserts  I supported to get Xmas pudding but I got brownie instead  We didnt want to say anything because we didnt want to wait for it 
R0209,Went for a Sunday brunch and unfortunately was quite disappointed  Food wise it was good but twice I had to ask where a drink was and also where a coffee was  Three staff members serving food yet still had to ask  Sadly wouldnt go again
R0209,Went for an occasion  Only there two hours  Food was ok  One of the party has vegetarian lasagne which was fab  I had heard it was the best steak in Dublin  I got a stirliin   worst steak I ever had  So tough and fatty I couldnt eat it   Side of bernaise sauce which was bland  Chips mediocre  Very disappointed 
R0209,"What happened   Been here so many times I decided it would be a nice relaxing spot for my 40th family meal  How wrong was I 

The service was beyond bad  My waiter and waitress clearly had issues grasping my drinks order  seaweed saison that I enjoyed at the craft beer festival never arrived and my cask Galway Hooker arrived on draft  �When the waiter came back he looked at me as if I had 2 heads  checked and told sorry not on tap 

My pork belly hadnt been cooked slow enough to render down and my scotch egg was nothing like I had here before l 

Special occasion means special single malt which was confused with a cocktail and after explanation and pointing they still screwed it up and then charged to the bill  Its ardbeg uigeadail not some bloody magic potion 

The so called coffee was weak as 3rd running from an espresso machine 

I asked for the bill as I knew it was time to give the table back  �10 min later no bill but a very belligerent waitress came up and demanded the table  �We normally leave a great tip but this time I was hard pressed to leave 2 percent  

The whole thing was well below par and really not what these guys are know for 

Come on guys  �I cannot articulate in a review my disappointment so I mentioned it to the host at front of house and while he was apologetic and offered money from the bill  this is not what I wanted but I did want to express how disappointed and saddened I was at one of my favorite spots is now down there in the dumps  �

BTW I did not accept money from the bill nor did I want it and I think in 17 years of paying my own bills I have complained perhaps 4 times  I normally adopt the quiet Irish mentality and moan later but I did want to let them know and hope they might get a grip  

I wont be back because Im afraid complacency breeds contempt "
R0209,"Wonderful place  wonderful staff and really delicious food     
My favorit soup is Chilli con carne "
R0210,Made a reservation for a special event  birthday  for Saturday 22nd December   They accepted the booking  a week in advance  and sent reminder emails  When we turned up on the 22nd the restaurant was closed   I called the phone number and someone in the office told me they closed yesterday for Christmas and when I said a booking was confirmed online I was told  we have published our opening times on all social media   No offer of assistance was made   Our day was ruined and the caller could have cared less   When I explained a booking had been accepted online the  person on the phone said Ill take it up with them but appeared disinterested in helping a disappointed customer  I assume if OT made a booking then this would have been sent  to the restaurant  and I would have expected to be contacted  in advance  not left to turn up to an empty restaurant   I would never return to a place that cares so little for its customers  Please note star ratings for food  service  ambiance and value were only completed as the form will not allow submission without   We never got any food or even inside the door 
R0210,"The staff is very friendly  good service  delicious food and a great atmosphere  
Would recommend as a nice brunch or lunch spot "
R0211,Excellent service 
R0211,"Absolutely awful  Went in this afternoon for lunch with my aunt and we were both very disappointed  Food was cold and there was a poor selection of available  

Except for a few shriveled up spring rolls and some trays of egg fried rice and noodles  which were dry and chewy  there was nothing remotely Chinese or Asian on offer  Anything was there was made up of poor quality chicken and pork  dripping in grease  grizzle and fat  

Passing by we saw many Asian people eating inside which is usually an indication of good quality authentic food but dont be fooled  this was not the case  

You could easily slap something tastier and more palatable up for yourself drunk by throwing whatever you had lying in the freezer into the oven "
R0211,Dinner was good and staff were very friendly and helpful
R0211,Fabulous food  great service  Will definitely return 
R0211,Great food and excellent service  The early bird menu has fantastic choices and is really good value 
R0211,Lovely staff but take away quality food Im afraid and very expensive  same price or dearer than another but nowhere near as good quality   Lovely helpful staff but we wont be going back  Its a pity as we hoped we had found a decent quality Chinese restaurant at last 
R0211,"This is our favourite Chinese Restaurant  Service is excellent  Staff are very cordial  friendly and chatty 
Food is to die for "
R0211,We had a fantastic time  The food and the service was five star  We will definitely be going back
