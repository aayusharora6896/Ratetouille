R0001,A great place for Irish music great bar and full of great people  After the Irish band more modern music on a must go
R0001,Absolutely exceptional food and staff were very friendly and helpful  Lovely atmosphere will definitely be back
R0001,Cant remember pizza better than this anywhere in Dublin  Gorgeous  really authentic italian food  Great prices too 
R0001,Cocktails were very impressive and a perfect end to a seriously tasty meal  A very deserved 4 5 star rating 
R0001,Decent  clean  and fast  Food wasnt bad but maybe a bit under seasoned  Overall a good stop for a fast  cheap bite 
R0002,"Poor poor poor

I ordered the breakfast  It arrived 30 mins later  Wrong order I asked for friends eggs  The staff were rude and made it seem like I was a hindrance to them "
R0002,Amazing  as always  great Staff and food selection and presentation were perfect and delicious 
R0008,Two people attended for dinner  My food was nice and cooked okay  However  my boyfriends was burnt and the garlic bread was not fully cooked 
R0008,Very bad service  rude staff members  Wasnt happy with the way I was treated 
R0008,Very disappointed in their poor customer service  We ordered 2 500ml bottles of coke  and were delivered the 330ml cans  We had already opened the cans before realising that they had given us the wrong size  so we called to complain and they told us theyd deliver us the correct bottles  �When they got here  they dropped off the bottles  left  and then came back to ask for the cans back a few minutes later  When we said we had already opened the cans  they then demanded the bottles back and said theyd give us the difference instead  20 cents   This was THEIR mistake  and they should have corrected it by giving us the bottles despite us having already opened the cans  �We were not interested in getting 20 cents back  we wanted the correct size bottles  �Any other restaurant would have just given us the bottles  Their customer service deserves zero stars
